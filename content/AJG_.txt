our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commissions fees supplemental revenues and contingent revenues and our costs to obtain and fulfill the service obligations to our clients can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of contracteffective dates on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of tax credits generated by our clean energy investments also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results

competition 

brokerage segment

the insurance brokerage and consulting business is highly competitive and there are many organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise providing the actual service to the client and the overall cost to our clients we provide sophisticated data analysis to help our clients make insurance decisions through our electronic platform smartmarket we also provide insurance carriers with individualized preference setting and risk identification capabilities as well as performance data and metrics we believe these capabilities provide a growing competitive advantage with respect to many of the smaller organizations with which we compete 

risk management segment

our risk management operation currently ranks as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s may 2021 edition we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position are our ability to deliver better outcomes reputation for outstanding service costefficient service and financial strength

human capital

in 2021 the covid19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on our human capital management many of our employees continue to work remotely for some or all of their work week and we continue to make investments in support of a hybrid work environment we have instituted safety protocols and procedures for employees when they are in an office

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 39000 employees with approximately 47 in the us and 53 outside of the us approximately 76 of our employees work in our brokerage segment and 19 in our risk management segment our remaining employees work in our corporate segment primarily in our home office and financial services division as well as in our service centers in india and elsewhere around the world in 2021 our total compensation expense was 32524 million for the brokerage segment and 5807 million for the risk management segment representing 55 and 60 respectively of brokerage and risk management segment revenues additional information regarding compensation expense both on a reported and an adjusted basis can be found elsewhere in this report under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges related to our acquisition of the willis towers watson’s plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations there are twelve remaining international deferred closings that comprise approximately 180 million of the initial purchase consideration that are subject to local regulatory approval and various licensing requirements that are expected to close in first and second quarters of 2022

risks relating to our business generally



































 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 















risks relating to our investments debt and common stock













please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results such as revenues and net earnings cash flows liquidity and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations in addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks

risks relating to the acquisition of willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations 

we may encounter integration challenges and the acquisition may not perform as expected

on december 1 2021 we completed the acquisition of the treaty reinsurance brokerage operations of willis towers watson plc the “acquisition” upon completion of the acquisition we paid willis towers watson plc an initial gross purchase price of 325 billion under the terms of the purchase agreement the purchase price is subject to potential additional deferred consideration of up to 750 million payable in 2025 based on revenues of the acquired operations in 2024 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations acquired in the acquisition that the acquired operations will perform as expected or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities it is possible that our experience in running the operations acquired in the acquisition will require us to adjust our expectations regarding the impact of the acquisition on our operating results in particular the amount of revenue we expect the acquired operations to lose due to the departure of key employees the loss of key clients within the acquired operations or for other reasons is based upon estimates assumptions and projections that may turn out to be incorrect as a result actual lost revenue within the acquired operations may be greater than anticipated in addition integration efforts are anticipated to be complex and may divert management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the risk of noncompliance with nonus laws regulations and policies could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives 

the acquisition will introduce us to several new geographic markets subjecting us to additional nonus laws regulations and policies which do not currently apply to us these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have become more stringent over time could increase our cost of doing business and could result in conflicting legal requirements these laws and regulations include international labor and employment laws data privacy requirements and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials we will be subject to the risk that we our employees our agents or our affiliated entities or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws regulations or policies for which we might be held responsible actual or alleged violations could result in substantial fines sanctions civil or criminal penalties debarment from government contracts curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions competitive or reputational harm litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives

while we believe that relations with work councils and trade unions in these countries are and will continue to be satisfactory work stoppages could occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements in addition collective bargaining negotiations may 1 result in significant increases in the cost of labor 2 divert management’s attention away from operating the business or 3 break down and result in the disruption of operations the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could result in increased costs and impair our ability to operate our business

we have made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition which may prove to be materially inaccurate

we have made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition which assumptions may be inaccurate including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition these assumptions relate to numerous matters including















there can be no assurance that deferred closings in certain jurisdictions will occur or that we will realize the expected benefits of the acquisition

there are deferred closings in twelve jurisdictions scheduled for the first and second quarters of 2022 representing approximately 180 million of the initial purchase consideration we can provide no assurance that the various conditions to these deferred closings will be satisfied including the receipt of regulatory or other necessary approvals or as to the terms on which any such approvals may be given 

although we currently anticipate that the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share on an as adjusted earnings basis for expected changes in operating expenses and other items that is not pursuant to gaap from and after its closing this expectation is based on assumptions about our business the operations to be acquired and preliminary estimates which may change materially as a result certain other amounts to be paid in connection with the acquisition may cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition a change in the assumptions may result in a change in future earnings which could be material

 

risks relating t o o ur business generally 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

the global spread of covid19 including potentially more contagious strains of covid19 such as the delta and omicron variants has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors many of which are not within our control and which we may not be able to accurately predict including its duration and scope the ultimate availability administration and effectiveness of vaccines around the world and our employees’ and the general population’s willingness to receive them governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including vaccine mandates which could be controversial for some employees the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response the ability of our clients to pay their insurance premiums which could impact our commission and fee revenues for our services the nature and extent of claims impacting the ability of underwriting enterprises to pay supplemental and contingent commissions the number of new arising workers’ compensation and general liability claims and the longterm impact of employees working from home including increased technology costs and employees’ holistic wellbeing



 



 

covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic and regulatory conditions stemming from the pandemic as well as reactions to future pandemics or new strains or resurgences of covid19 could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this report which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price further covid19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations

 

an economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

apart from the impact of covid19 a decline in economic activity for any other reason including inflation climate change the transition to a lowcarbon economy or the uncertainty caused by political violence and chaos including repercussions from an attack by russia on ukraine could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage and 

 

consulting services that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors  any such reduction or decline whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in certain industries or in certain countries and regions in which we operate could adversely impact our commission revenues  consulting revenues or revenues from managing thirdparty insurance claims  s ome of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risktaking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we have a significant amount of receivables from certain of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance if those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations the failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients further the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable underwriting enterprises are also clients of our reinsurance brokerage operations so any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage for example because of large payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas overall risktaking capital capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefit consulting firms and to a lesser extent third party claims administration and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations

our ordinarycourse acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth particularly in our brokerage segment and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future see also “risks relating to acquisition of willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations” above failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms private equitybacked consolidators and newly public insurance brokers one of which has a partnership tax structure that gives it an advantage in pricing acquisitions has in some cases made and could in the future make appropriate acquisition targets more difficult to identify and more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of larger acquisitions than we have historically see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for information regarding the size of transactions in the reporting period

postacquisition risks include poor cultural fit and risks relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar or complex markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology pay equity human resources or employee attrition some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses

the insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world three of the firms we compete with in the global risk management and brokerage markets have larger revenues than ours in addition many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms over the past decade or more private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones across all of our operations insurtech and technologybased startups are entering the business in most cases these businesses complement or enhance our offerings but in some cases they compete with us

 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client  our data and analytics capabilities and our ability to help our clients manage their overall risk exposure and insurance or reinsurance costs losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

consolidation among our existing competitors could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us 

these developments include 















new competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided

 

contingent and supplemental revenue s we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenue s and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations 

a meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period generally in the first or second quarter based on the growth andor profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year on the other hand supplemental revenues are paid up front on an annual or quarterly basis generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement while underwriting enterprises generally maintain supplemental revenues in the current year at a predetermined rate that rate can change in future years as described above if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability volume or growth thresholds as the case may be or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations in the case of contingent revenues under revenue recognition accounting standards this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected

our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology these may include new applications or insurancerelated services based on artificial intelligence machine learning robotics blockchain or new approaches to data mining we may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants for example through disintermediation or new entrants such as technology companies “insurtech” startup companies and others these new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate we must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses investments in technology systems may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs

in some cases we depend on key thirdparty vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is one of our key assets we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our expertise level of service ability to protect client information trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities such as ethics culture and values our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees investors regulators and the communities in which we operate negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above including our association with clients or business partners with damaged reputations or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees could damage our reputation our reputation could also be harmed by negative perceptions or publicity regarding esg matters including concerns with environmental matters climate change workforce diversity political spending pay equity harassment racial justice cybersecurity and data privacy any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients employees or investors result in lower esg ratings exclusion of our stock from esgoriented indices and reduced demand for our stock from esgfocused investment funds increase our cost of borrowing in the future or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see below for additional risk factors regarding climate risks and esg initiatives and disclosures 

 

climate risks including the risk of an economic crisis risks associated with the physical effects of climate change and disruptions caused by the transition to a lowcarbon economy could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

climate change has been widely identified by investors and regulators as a systemic risk to the global economy the us federal reserve has warned that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment which could create unpredictable followon effects in financial markets if this occurred not only would our business be negatively impacted by the general economic decline but a drop in the stock market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock

the transition to a lowcarbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business our clients in such industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurancerelated or consulting services which could adversely impact our commission revenues consulting revenues or revenues from managing thirdparty insurance claims negative publicity arising from our association with clients in disfavored businesses or industries or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks facing gallagher or on reducing our own carbon emissions could damage our reputation with investors clients employees and regulators in addition the transition to a lowcarbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies if we fail to innovate and provide valuable services to our clients in response to these changes we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do

we do not assume net underwriting risk other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital and thus do not experience direct material financial implications related to extreme weather events in addition we are a professional services firm with people as our most important asset and limited physical operations however if underwriting enterprises fail or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage because of large payouts related to climate change overall risktaking capital capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability underwriting enterprises are also clients of our reinsurance brokerage operations so any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients

our esgrelated aspirations goals and initiatives and our public statements and disclosures regarding them expose us to numerous risks

our business may face increased scrutiny from the investment community other stakeholders regulators and the media related to our esg activities including goals targets and objectives we may announce in the future and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them if our esg practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our reputation our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment business partner or as an acquiror could be negatively impacted similarly our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals targets and objectives to comply with ethical environmental or other standards regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters could have the same negative impacts as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent including our senior management team

we depend upon members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy we could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders including our chief executive officer we could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace throughout our organization competition for talent is intense in many areas of our business particularly in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering in addition our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers along with their clients business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition we enter into agreements with many of our brokers and significant clientfacing employees and all of our executive officers which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information andor soliciting our clients prospects and employees upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements although we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action such legal actions may not be effective in preventing such breaches theft or infringement our failure to adequately address any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition see also “ risks related to remote work” in our covid19 risk factor above 

 

our substantial operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us  

in 2021 we generated approximately 33 of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the us the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations outside the us or create difficulties in staffing and managing such operations for example we have substantial operations in india that provide important services for our global organization to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region rising tensions between india and china incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to























 













we face a variety of risks in our risk management thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic caused a reduction in the number of claims we otherwise would have processed negatively impacting our third party claims administration operations to a greater degree than the rest of our business in 2021 the number of claims we processed increased but not to the prepandemic level this disproportionate negative impact could continue into 2022 our third party claims administration operations also face a variety of additional risks distinct from those faced by the rest of our business including the risks that 

















if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

 

we face a variety of risks in our benefit consulting operations distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage operations 

 

our benefit consulting operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations the portion of our revenue derived from consulting engagements and special project work is more vulnerable to reduction postponement cancellation or nonrenewal during an economic downturn than traditional insurance brokerage commissions and we did experience such a reduction for a portion of 2021 if the economic recovery stalls or reverses in 2022 we could again experience deterioration in these sources of revenue certain areas within our retirement consulting practice may attract a higher level of regulatory scrutiny due to regulators’ historical interest in such matters including pensionrelated products and investment advisory and brokerdealer services in addition we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employersponsored healthcare new laws or regulations reducing employersponsored health insurance could impact clients’ demand for our services if we are unable to adapt our services to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employersponsored healthcare our results of operations could be adversely impacted

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability

business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations damage our reputation and impact client relationships 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business such a disruption could be caused by a cybersecurity incident for example as disclosed in previous filings we experienced a ransomware attack in 2020 human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political violence and unrest in the us or elsewhere around the world or war our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us see our covid19 risk factor above

for example our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs® our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services in addition we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors a disruption affecting risxfacs® thirdparty cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business including key customer relationship management software could have a material adverse effect on our operations cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships

regulatory legal and accounting risks

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and intellectual property 

we rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities including our secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity or data breaches of certain of the systems on which we rely have occurred although to date we have not been materially impacted by any such breach in the future breaches of any such thirdparty or internal system may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions 

 

we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents  such as computer viruses or unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems  and privacy incidents such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data which to date have not had a m aterial impact on our business for example we have previously disclosed a ransomware incident that occurred in 2020 

additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling privacy and security policies and protocols which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack our recent acquisition of the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations may enhance this risk 

in the future any material cybersecurity or data incidents or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of clients and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses such incidents could result in confidential personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen used to perpetuate fraud maliciously made public surreptitiously modified or rendered inaccessible for a period of time as we experienced in connection with the 2020 ransomware incident referred to above during a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance it is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective see “risks related to remote work” in our covid19 risk factor above for a discussion of how remote work enhances these risks 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives policies and resources and employee training the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase and as technology changes as these threats evolve cybersecurity and data incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation

with respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors we have processes designed to require third party it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access correct and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations eg fines of up to 4 of worldwide revenue under the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and to 7500 per intentional violation under the california consumer privacy act ccpa in the us there is pending federal legislation and several states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the gdpr and ccpa 

in addition in the us legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws for example we are subject to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity regulation for financial services companies and ccpa india and other countries where we have operations outside the us have also proposed sweeping new data protection laws in some cases including data localization laws that may require that personal data stay within their borders 

 

complying with enhanced obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws is resulting in significant costs of developing implementing or securing our servers and is requir ing us to allocate more resources to new privacy compliance processes and to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to supervision and regulations promulgated by regulatory or selfregulatory bodies such as the sec the nyse the doj the irs the office of foreign assets control the federal trade commission and the financial industry regulatory authority finra in the us the financial conduct authority in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our retirementrelated consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients underwriting enterprises and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties andor the loss of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges for example china recently adopted a “blocking” statute similar to that of the eu requiring compliance with certain chinese laws if they conflict with us laws in 2022 we expect to have a reinsurance operation in china following a deferred closing of the acquisition of the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations in that jurisdiction rising global tensions and protectionism may also lead other countries to adopt similar blocking statutes which could make it more difficult and costly for us to expand our operations globally 

changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies or the failure of state and local governments to follow through on agreedupon state and local tax credits or other tax related incentives could adversely affect our results of operations or require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business 

for example the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises  separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them  future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients underwriting enterprises or other business partners

on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tcja which significantly revised the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries if the us passes legislation reversing part or all of the tcja and corresponding regulations our tax rate could increase 

 

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption law s sanctioned parties restrictions  and fatca  

in countries outside the us a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption in such parts of the world in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

 

our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance including investigating business practices and taking steps to address the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies andor such laws and regulations we use third party partners and agents in certain jurisdictions where it is common industry practice to do so violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm although we have not been materially impacted by any such violations within the past year we investigated certain business practices that violated our policies and terminated those found to be involved

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the us the eu and other jurisdictions in which we operate in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees and our failure to do so properly could result in penalties 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are or have been subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage including with respect to business interruption or other potential coverage for covid‑19 losses report claims on behalf of clients provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory pension and claims handling services there is the risk that our employees or subagents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decisionmaking services to clients additionally our recent acquisition of the willis towers watson plc reinsurance brokerage operations includes a securities business if our clients experience investment losses our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business where appropriate we have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant

as more fully described in note 17 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services business has been under investigation by the irs since 2013  in addition we are defending a lawsuit along with chemmod llc and other defendants asserting infringement of patents held by midwest energy emissions corp and mes inc we cannot reasonably predict the outcomes of these or other matters that we may become involved with in the future an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational 

 

damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to revenue recognition and deferred costs  see note 4 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments income taxes revenue recognition deferred costs stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements further as additional guidance relating to the tcja is released or if the current us president’s administration takes action to reverse portions of the tcja our estimates related to the tcja may change additionally changes in accounting standards see note 2 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations see also “we have made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition which may prove to be materially inaccurate” above

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections or our internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability consume financial resources to pursue or defend and prevent us from offering some services or products in addition these claims whether with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus and resources from business operations successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we began generating tax credits under irc section 45 in 2009 as of december 31 2021 we had generated a total of 17061 million in irc section 45 tax credits of which approximately 6556 million have been used to offset us federal tax liabilities and 10505 million remain unused and available to offset future us federal tax liabilities our irc section 45 investments’ ability to generate additional tax credits expired on december 31 2021

our ability to use tax credits under irc section 45 depends upon the operations in which we invested having satisfied the conditions set forth in irc section 45 these include among others the “placedinservice” condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal while we have received some degree of confirmation from the irs relating to our ability to claim these tax credits the irs could ultimately determine that the operations did not satisfy the conditions set forth in irc section 45 similarly the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our prior synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 at december 31 2021 we had exposure with respect to 1080 million of previously earned tax credits under irc section 29 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them in addition the irs audited certain of the irc section 29 facilities without requiring any changes

 

while none of our prior irc section 29 operations are currently under audit several of the irc section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the irs one of these partnerships received a notice from the irs disallowing our coinvestors from claiming tax credits the partnership defended its position in tax court and prevailed in august 2019 the irs is appealing this ruling litigation is inherently uncertain and accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or other irs audits and their potential impact on us the irs could place the remaining irc section 45 operations and any of the prior irc section 29 operations under audit an adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in irc section 29 tax credits 

there is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with the chemmod™ solution to the same extent as us laws leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the us who may attempt to copy such intellectual property in addition other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to the chemmod™ solution on july 17 2019 midwest energy emissions corp and mes inc together midwest energy filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against us chem‑mod llc and numerous other related and unrelated parties some of whom are seeking indemnification from chemmod llc the complaint alleges that the named defendants infringed patents held exclusively by midwest energy and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief we dispute the allegations contained in the complaint and intend to continue defending this matter vigorously litigation is inherently uncertain and accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter however we believe the probability of a material loss is remote

the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations were subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety some environmental laws without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct impose liability on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by having used the chem‑mod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation for example claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance in addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators or other end users will result in that facility owner or operator or other end user accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators or other end users fully complied with all applicable laws and regulations and this could result in environmental or product liability claims it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage nuisance diminution of property value or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim and defense of such claims can be costly even when such defense prevails if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2021 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 63 billion including 16 billion that we added in connection with our acquisition of willis towers watson’s plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time our debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates a small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to stockholders acquisitions 

 

capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all  

the agreements governing our debt include covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the reinsurance securities business we acquired as part of the acquisition serves from time to time as the underwriter and initial purchaser of securities such as catastrophe bonds issued by our reinsurance company clients this involves us acting as an intermediary to use our capital on hand and shortterm borrowings to cover the purchase price of the securities we place the securities with investors and use the funds we receive from them to repay our obligations risks specific to these shortterm borrowings include counterparty risk which is the risk that arises due to uncertainty about a counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations with respect to the investors nonperformance by any of our counterparties in these transactions for financial or other reasons could potentially expose us to material losses

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to maintain adequate liquidity fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources we would also face the risk of a credit rating downgrade if we do not retire or refinance the debt to levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies in a timely manner further a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock

further we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the us in the event we are unable to meet these us based cash requirements 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient manner

 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected  

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

an important way we grow our business is through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units performance stock units options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest our stockholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur

introduction

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” beginning on page 35 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and consulting services and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients and we do not assume net underwriting risks we are headquartered in rolling meadows illinois have operations in 68 countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in 2021 we expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth we generate approximately 67 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 33 generated internationally primarily in the uk australia canada new zealand and bermuda based on 2021 revenues we expect that our international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues in 2022 will increase compared to 2021 in part due to our acquisition of the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations see further below we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 73 13 and 14 respectively to 2021 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds clean energy investments and interest income from premium financing our ability to generate additional tax credits from our section 45 clean energy investments ended in december 2021 unless congress reinstates the law allowing for such tax credits we do not expect to generate any revenue or earnings from such investments in 2022

acquisition of the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations

on december 1 2021 we acquired substantially all of the willis towers watson’s plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations for an initial gross consideration of 325 billion and potential additional consideration of 750 million subject to certain thirdyear revenue targets there are twelve remaining international operations with deferred closings that comprise approximately 180 million of the initial purchase consideration that are subject to local regulatory approval and are expected to close in the first and second quarters of 2022 we funded the transaction using cash on hand including the 14 billion of net cash raised in our may 17 2021 followon common stock offering 850 million of net cash borrowed in our may 20 2021 30year senior note issuance 750 million of net cash borrowed in our november 9 2021 10year 400 million and 30year 350 million senior note issuances and short‑term borrowings

 

 

 

significant developments and trends

impact of covid 19 pandemic recovery 

relative to fourth quarter 2020 during fourth quarter 2021







if economic conditions continue to improve we believe we may continue to see favorable revenue benefits in our brokerage and risk management segments in the first quarter of 2022 relative to the same quarter in 2021 however if the economic recovery slows due to the omicron variant or other factors we could see less revenue benefits than we experienced in second third and fourth quarters of 2021 

during the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 and first quarter of 2021 we realized significant expense savings totaling approximately 60 million to 75 million per quarter relative to the prior year same quarters adjusted for pro forma full‑quarter costs related to acquisitions as a result of reduced travel entertainment and advertising expenses reduced costs from lower employee medical plan utilization a reduction in workforce wage controls and reduced use of external consultants during the second third and fourth quarters of 2021 as we increased our business activities relative to the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 we experienced increases in travel and entertainment full restoration of advertising and more normalized usage of our employee medical plan resumption of annual supportlayer wage increases increased use of external consultants further investment in support of our hybrid employee environment continued investment in cyber security and an increase in incentive compensation these incremental costs totaled approximately 15 million 25 million and 30 million in our brokerage segment relative to the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively looking forward to 2022 we believe we will see incrementally higher brokerage segment costs relative to 2021 and if the pace of economic recovery accelerates beyond our expectations we could see expense increases higher than our current estimates

insurance market overview

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty underwriting enterprises have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises  increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas as markets harden buyers of insurance such as our brokerage clients have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate including by raising their deductibles andor reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures

 

we typically cite the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab insurance pricing quarterly survey at this time as an indicator of the current insurance rate environment the fourth quarter 2021 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report the first three 2021 quarterly surveys indicated that us commercial propertycasualty rates increased by 100  83  and 89  on average for the first second and third quarters of 2021  respectively we expect a similar trend to be noted when the ciab fourth quarter 2021 survey report is issued which would signal overall continued price firming and hardening in some items  the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

we believe increases in propertycasualty rates will continue in 2022 due to rising loss costs resulting from replacement cost inflation increased frequency of catastrophe losses and social inflation and continued low fixed income investment returns the economies of the us and other countries around the world contracted during 2020 as a result of covid19 global economic conditions in many geographies improved during 2021 and have resumed growth despite supply chain disruptions and new covid19 variants global economic growth is expected to continue in 2022 and is likely to lead to higher exposure units inflation a tight labor market and lower unemployment additionally we expect that our history of strong new business generation solid retentions and enhanced valueadded services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world overall we believe that in a positive rate environment with growing exposure units our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and highquality valueadded capabilities by strengthening our clients’ insurance portfolios and delivering insurance and risk management solutions within our clients’ budget based on our experience there is adequate capacity in the insurance market for most lines of coverage terms and conditions are tightening most insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions and clients can broadly still obtain coverage 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and six clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party all 35 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants received tax credits through 2019 and the 21 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants received tax credits through 2021 all twentyone of the 2011 era plants were under long‑term production contracts with several utilities those agreements ended december 31 2021 due to the expiration of the irc section 45 program 

we also own a 465 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chem‑mod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests currently chemmod is not anticipated to generate aftertax earnings after 2021

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors”

results of operations

information regarding nongaap measures and other

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted adjusted eps adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition because they provide investors with measures that our chief operating decision maker uses when reviewing the company’s performance and for the other reasons described below our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided we make determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer incentive compensation performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted ebitdac 

 

adjusted nongaap presentation  we believe that the adjusted non gaap presentation of our 2021 and 2020 information  presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us  the after  tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period 

























nongaap earnings measures

we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segment each as defined below provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance adjusted eps is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity we also consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as ways to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis in addition adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability



 





organic revenues a nongaap measure   for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations in each year presented these revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2022 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this nongaap measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner

reconciliation of nongaap information presented to gaap measures  this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac before acquisitions diluted net earnings per share as adjusted and organic revenue measures 

brokerage 

the brokerage segment accounted for 73 of our revenue in 2021 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our brokerage segment generates revenues by 









 

the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises  based on a percentage of premium s paid by our clients  or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions   commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans commission s depend upon a large number of factors including the type of risk being placed  the particular underwriting enterprise ’s demand the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract rather than being tied to the amount of premiums fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide our services  in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenue s s upplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria c ontingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

financial information relating to our brokerage segment results for 2021 and 2020 in millions except per share percentages and workforce data 

 



 

 

 

the following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac for 2021 and 2020 in millions

 



 

commissions and fees  the aggregate increase in base commissions and fees for 2021 was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2021 and 2020 2559 million and organic revenue growth commission revenues increased 15 and fee revenues increased 14 in 2021 compared to 2020 respectively the organic change in base commission and fee revenues was 8 in 2021 and 3 in 2020 

 

in our propertycasualty brokerage operations during the threemonth period ended december 31 2021 we saw continued strong customer retention and new business generation improving renewal exposure units ie insured values payrolls employees miles driven gross receipts etc and continued increases in premium rates across most geographies and lines of coverage in our employee benefits brokerage operations during the threemonth period ended december 31 2021 we saw continued improvement in covered lives on renewal business and new consulting and special project work we believe these favorable trends should continue in 2022 however if the economic recovery slows or reverses course we could see our revenue growth soften from first half levels of 2021

 

items excluded from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for 2021 and 2020 include the following in millions 

 



 



 

for 2021 and 2020 we issued 1423000 and 1857000 shares respectively of our common stock at the request of sellers andor in connection with taxfree exchange acquisitions in addition on may 17 2021 we completed a followon common stock offering in which we issued 103 million shares of our common stock the net proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the acquisition of the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations 

 

on december 1 2021 we acquired substantially all of the willis towers watson’s plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations for an initial gross consideration of 325 billion and potential additional consideration of 750 million subject to certain thirdyear revenue targets there are twelve remaining international operations with deferred closings that comprise approximately 180 million of the initial purchase consideration that are subject to local regulatory approval and are expected to close in first and second quarters of 2022 we funded the transaction using cash on hand including the 14 billion of net cash raised in our may 17 2021 followon common stock offering the 850 million of net cash borrowed in our may 20 2021 30year senior note issuance 750 million of net cash borrowed in our november 9 2021 10year 400 million and 30year 350 million senior note issuances and short‑term borrowings

 

following the completion of the acquisition of the reinsurance brokerage operations discussed above we and willis towers watson which we refer to as wtw entered into transition service agreements which we refer to as tsa under the agreement wtw will provide certain specified back office support services globally on a transitional basis for a period of up to two years from december 1 2021 based on the specific location and type of services being provided by wtw such services include among other things client related billings collections and carrier remittances payroll and other human resource services information systems real estate as well as accounting support the charges for the transition services are generally intended to allow the providing company to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services plus all outofpocket costs and expenses under the tsa there is the option at our request for two extension periods for each service provided for up to six months each if we do exercise the extensions there is a profit margin markup added in each period

 

on november 9 2021 we closed and funded an offering of 7500 million of unsecured senior notes in two tranches the 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 240 senior notes are due 2031 which we refer to as the 2031 november notes and 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 305 senior notes are due 2052 which we refer to as the 2052 november notes and together with the 2031 november notes the november notes the weighted average interest rate is 280  per annum after giving effect to underwriting costs we used the net proceeds of the november notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the willis tower watson plc treaty reinsurance transaction 

on may 20 2021 we closed and funded an offering of 15000 million of unsecured senior notes in two tranches the 6500 million aggregate principal amount of 250 senior notes were due 2031 which we refer to as the 2031 notes and the 8500 million aggregate principal amount of 350 senior notes are due 2051 which we refer to as the 2051 notes the weighted average interest rate was 331 per annum after giving effect to underwriting costs and the net hedge loss in conjunction with the termination of the willis tower watson plc treaty reinsurance transaction on july 29 2021 we exercised the special option redemption feature for the 2031 senior notes these notes were redeemed on august 13 2021 which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 162 million we used the net proceeds of this offering related to the 2051 notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance transaction 

on may 17 2021 we closed on a followon public offering of our common stock whereby 103 million shares of our stock were issued for net proceeds after underwriting discounts and other expenses related to this offering of 14379 million we used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the acquisition of the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations 

supplemental and contingent revenues  reported supplemental and contingent revenues recognized in 2021 and 2020 by quarter are as follows in millions 

 



 

investment income and net gains on divestitures  this primarily represents 1 interest income earned on cash cash equivalents and restricted funds and interest income from premium financing and 2 net gains losses related to divestitures and sales of books of business which were 188 million and 58 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively also included in net gains in 2021 is a 87 million gain we recognized related to our acquisition of an additional 70 equity interest in edelweiss gallagher insurance brokers limited which we refer to as edelweiss which increased our ownership in edelweiss to 100 the gain represents the increase in fair value of our initial 300 equity interest in edelweiss based on the purchase price paid to acquire the additional 70 equity interest on december 16 2020 we completed the sale of a uk wealth management business we purchased over four years ago that no longer strategically fit in our benefits operations in fourth quarter 2020 we recognized a net pretax noncash loss on the sale of approximately 120 million primarily due to the write‑off of the remaining net book value of the amortizable intangible assets  

 

investment income in 2021 increased compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in interest income from our us operations primarily due to increases in interest income related to premium funding operations and increases in income from our partially owned entities accounted for using the equity method partially offset by decreases in interest income due to decreases in interest rates earned on our funds 

 

compensation expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2021 and 2020 compensation expense in millions 

 



 

the 3699 million increase in compensation expense in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to compensation associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve month period ended december 31 2021  1029 million producer compensation and other incentive compensation linked to operating results  2660 million in the aggregate and an increase in temporarystaffing  10 million during 2021 relative to 2020 as we increased our business activities we saw more normalized usage of our employee medical plan and resumption of annual supportlayer wage increases

 

operating expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2021 and 2020 operating expense in millions 

 



 

the 707 million increase in operating expense in 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the twelve month period ended december 31 2021  395 million and an increase in technology expenses  339 million partially offset by a decrease of 27 million in the aggregate due to continued operating control measures during 2021 relative to 2020 as we increased our business activities we saw increases in travel and entertainment full restoration of advertising and increased use of external consultants

depreciation  the increase in depreciation expense in 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2021 was the depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in 2021 

amortization  the decrease in amortization in 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to the writeoff of amortizable assets in 2021 see impairment discussion below partially offset by the impact of amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed in 2021 and 2020 expiration lists non‑compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives two to fifteen years for expiration lists two to six years for noncompete agreements and two to fifteen years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews performed on amortizable intangible assets in 2021 and 2020 we wrote off 168 million and 515 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment we review all of our intangible assets for impairment periodically at least annually for goodwill and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we perform such impairment reviews at the division ie reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible 

 

assets in reviewing amortizable intangible assets if the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of amortization expense w e perform ed a qualitative impairment review on carrying value of our goodwill for all of our reporting units as of december 31 2021 and no indicators of impairment were noted 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2021 and 2020 we recognized 347 million and 320 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our acquisitions made from 2017 to 2021 during 2021 and 2020 we recognized 816 million of expense and 617 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 95 and 131 acquisitions respectively 

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2017 to 2021 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to three‑year period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income

see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 14 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments

liquidity and capital resources

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

 

in light of the economic uncertainty caused by covid19 subsequent to the first quarter of 2020 we preserv ed liquidity during 2020 by reducing capital expenditures for the remainder of 2020 and made working capital process changes such as mov ed more cash into the us from our international operations pursu ed collections on receivables from our customers and partners and renegotiat ed longer payment terms on vendor payables  we also slowed down our acquisition program in the second and third quarters of 2020  some of these initiatives and trends continued into 2021 however as economic conditions continue to improve our capital expenditures and acquisition activity have moved towards prepandemic levels we believe we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this uncertain period if we experience a significant reduction in revenue in the future  we have additional alternatives to maintain liquidity including use of common stock to fund future acquisitions 

on december 1 2021 we acquired substantially all of the willis towers watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations for an initial gross consideration of 325 billion and potential additional consideration of 750 million subject to certain thirdyear revenue targets there are twelve remaining international operations with deferred closings that comprise approximately 180 million of the initial purchase consideration that are subject to local regulatory approval and are expected to close in first and second quarters of 2022 we funded the transaction using cash on hand including the 14 billion of net cash raised in our may 17 2021 followon common stock offering 850 million of net cash borrowed in our may 20 2021 30year senior note issuance 750 million of net cash borrowed in our november 9 2021 10year 400 million and 30year 350 million senior note issuances and short‑term borrowings

operating cash flows

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2021 and 2020 we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and the followon common stock offering 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 17041 million and 18071 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively see note 20 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for a discussion on reclassifications that were made to the 2020 and 2019 consolidated statement of cash flows in 2021 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to increases in the amount of net income taxes paid payments on acquisition earnouts in excess of original estimates and interest on debt paid in 2021 and to timing differences between periods with cash receipts and disbursements related to other current assets compared to 2020 the 2020 income taxes paid amount was favorably impacted due to an amt refund of 285 million and approximately 200 million from taxpayment deferrals and refunds as a result of the cares act and other similar temporary relief measures available globally the 2021 income taxes paid amount was unfavorably impacted due to payment of the 200 million of 2020 taxpayments deferrals as noted in the previous sentence and also approximately 1060 million of tax prepayments made in 2021 with regards to tax method changes filed with our 2020 tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2021 those method changes also effected our 2021 estimated tax payments these payments would have been made in future periods and do not represent additional taxes due 

during 2021 we managed our working capital in terms of receivables and payables as a cautionary step to protect liquidity during this uncertain period during 2021 employee matching contributions to the 401k plan of 636 million relating to 2020 were funded using common stock during 2020 employee matching contributions to the 401k plan of 594 million relating to 2019 were funded using cash 

our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted if the amount of irc section 45 tax credits generated which is the amount we recognize for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount of tax credits utilized to reduce our tax cash obligations excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities please see “clean energy investments” below for more information on their potential future impact on cash provided by operating activities 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings  adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 19033 million and 15968 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 9068 million and 8188 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

 

fiduciary funds 

in addition cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was favorably impacted by timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of client fiduciary related balances in 2021 compared to 2020 the following table summarizes two lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2021 and 2020 in millions



in our capacity as an insurance broker we collect premiums from insureds and after deducting our commissions andor fees remit these premiums to underwriting enterprises we hold unremitted insurance premiums in a fiduciary capacity until we disburse them and the use of such funds is restricted by laws in certain states and foreign jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate various state and foreign agencies regulate insurance brokers and provide specific requirements that limit the type of investments that may be made with such funds accordingly we invest these funds in cash and us treasury fund accounts we can earn interest income on these unremitted funds which is included in investment income in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings these unremitted amounts are reported as restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the related liability reported as premiums payable to underwriting enterprises additionally several of our foreign subsidiaries are required by various foreign agencies to meet certain liquidity and solvency requirements related to our third party administration business and in certain of our brokerage operations we are responsible for client claim funds that we hold in a fiduciary capacity we do not earn any interest income on the funds held these client funds have been included in restricted cash along with a corresponding liability in premiums payable to underwriting enterprises in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet

at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had fiduciary funds of 41 billion and 29 billion respectively

defined benefit pension plan

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2021 and 2020 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2021 and 2020 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan 

see note 13 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit pension plan we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension plan which we refer to together as the plan the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plan is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plan including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in 2021 the funded status of the plan was favorably impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2021 the net impact of which was approximately 136 million in addition the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2021 than anticipated by approximately 171 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2021 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2021 of 307 million in 2020 the funded status of the plan was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2020 the net impact of which was approximately 150 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2020 than anticipated by approximately 179 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2020 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2020 of 29 million while the change in the funded status of the plan had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2021 and 2020 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods

 

investing cash flows 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 1286 million and 993 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively in 2021 and 2020 capital expenditures include amounts incurred related to investments made in information technology and software development projects relating to the development of our corporate headquarters we received property tax related credits under a taxincrement financing note from rolling meadows illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit incentives from these two programs could total between 600 million and 900 million over a fifteenyear period in 2022 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 1850 million part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and investments being made in information technology and software development projects 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash and restricted cash acquired was 32509 million and 3243 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to our acquisition of the willis towers watson plc reinsurance brokerage operations in addition during 2021 and 2020 we issued 17 million shares 2496 million and 30 million shares 3061 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 38 and 27 acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2021 and 2020 totaled approximately 10020 million and 2514 million respectively in 2022 we expect to use new debt our credit agreement cash from operations and our common stock or a combination thereof to fund all of the acquisitions we complete 

if liquidity concerns arise we may be more likely to use common stock to fund acquisitions

 

dispositions  during 2021 and 2020 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains losses of 189 million of gains and 58 million of losses respectively on december 16 2020 we completed the sale of a uk wealth management business that we purchased over four years ago that no longer strategically fit in our benefits operations in fourth quarter 2020 we recognized a net pretax noncash loss on sale of approximately 120 million primarily due to the writeoff of the remaining net book value of the amortizable intangible assets 

we received cash proceeds of 157 million and 82 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively related to these transactions 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2020 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2022 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash in particular future periods is not possible at this time however if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows through at least 2027 due to the utilization of irc section 45 tax credits to offset taxable income in years after the program expired while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see clean energy investments on page 50 for a more detailed description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties

earnout obligations 

substantially all of the purchase agreements related to the acquisitions we do contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2017 to 2021 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future potential operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 18739 million of which 9885 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made of which approximately 6703 million can be settled in cash or stock at our option and 3182 million must be settled in cash

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital and access to additional capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets rightofuse assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes revenue recognition deferred costs stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein we believe the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies note 2 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or potential future impact on the our financial results if determinable

revenue recognition 

description

the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions these commissions and fees revenues are substantially recognized at a point in time on the effective date of the associated policies when control of the policy transfers to the client as well as deferring certain revenues to reflect delivery of services over the contract period whether we are paid a commission or a fee the vast majority of our services are associated with the placement of an insurance or insurancelike contract accordingly we recognize approximately 80 of our commission and fee revenues on the effective date of the underlying insurance contract the amount of revenue we recognize is based on our costs to provide our services up and through that effective date including an appropriate estimate of our profit margin on a portfolio basis based on the proportion of additional services we provide in each period after the effective date of the insurance contract including an appropriate estimate of our profit margin we recognize approximately 15 of our commission and fee revenues in the first three months and the remaining 5 thereafter 

 

for supplemental revenues certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues for the volume of premium placed with them and for insights into our sales pipeline our sales capabilities or our risk selection knowledge these amounts are in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above and not all business we place with underwriting enterprises is eligible for supplemental revenues unlike contingent revenues discussed below these revenues are primarily a fixed amount or fixed percentage of premium of the underlying eligible insurance contracts for supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed percentage of premium our obligation to the underwriting enterprise is substantially completed upon the effective date of the underlying insurance contract and revenue is fully earned at that time for supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed amount revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period consistent with the performance of our obligations almost always over an annual term

 

for contingent revenues certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues for our sales capabilities our risk selection knowledge or our administrative efficiencies these amounts are in excess of the commission or fee revenues discussed above and not all business we place with participating underwriting enterprises is eligible for contingent revenues unlike supplemental revenues also discussed above these revenues are variable generally based on growth the loss experience of the underlying insurance contracts andor our efficiency in processing the business we generally operate under calendar year contracts but we do not receive these revenues from the underwriting enterprises until the following calendar year generally in the first and second quarters after verification of the performance indicators outlined in the contracts accordingly during each reporting period we must make our best estimate of amounts we have earned using historical averages and other factors to project such revenues 

see revenue recognition and contracts with customers in notes 1 and 4 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements

 

judgments and uncertainties 

for commissions and fees these periods may be different than the underlying premium payment patterns of the insurance contracts but the vast majority of our services are fully provided within one year of the insurance contract effective date for supplemental and contingent commissions we base our estimates each period on a contractbycontract basis where available in certain cases it is impractical to assess a very large number of smaller contingent revenue contracts so we use a historical portfolio estimate in aggregate because our expectation of the ultimate contingent revenue amounts to be earned can vary from period to period especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios our estimates might change significantly from quarter to quarter for example in circumstances where our revenues are dependent on a full calendar year loss ratio adverse loss experience in the fourth quarter could not only negate revenue earnings in the fourth quarter but also trigger the need to reverse revenues previously recognized during the prior quarters variable consideration is recognized when we conclude based on all the facts and information available at the reporting date that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue as noted above estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors the vast majority of our brokerage contracts and service understandings are for a period of one year or less and historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years

income taxes 

description

we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the us but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due see income taxes in notes 1 and 19 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements

judgments and uncertainties

changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds

effect if actual results differ from assumptions

changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future other than those potential impacts we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 

impairment of goodwill 

description

goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount additionally we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques with the primary technique being an income approach discounted cash flow method and another technique being a market approach guideline public company method which use significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy we include assumptions about revenue growth operating margins discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets business plans economic projections and marketplace data and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples see intangible assets in notes 1 and 7 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions

effect if actual results differ from assumptions

we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 all of our material reporting units passed the impairment analysis

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates market ebitdac comparables and credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value it could result in material impairments of our goodwill 

impairment of amortizable intangible assets

description

amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset a change in its physical condition or an unexpected change in financial performance

when evaluating amortizable intangible assets for impairment we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset

we recorded impairment charges related to amortizable intangible assets of 176 million 517 million and 01 million 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively see intangible assets in notes 1 and 7 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements 

judgments and uncertainties

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions including useful lives and intended use of assets observable market valuations forecasted revenue growth operating margins and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value

effect if actual results differ from assumptions

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of amortizable intangible assets during the last three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of amortizable intangible assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material 

 

earnout o bligations 

description

substantially all of the purchase agreements related to the acquisitions we do contain provisions for potential earnout obligations the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the terms of the purchase agreements and the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 

judgments and uncertainties

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements which is a level 3 fair value measurement in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability revenue growth rates generally ranged from 25 to 150 for our 2021 acquisitions we estimated future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and the financial projections just described we then discounted these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration market based rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets the discount rates generally ranged from 70 to 105 for our 2021 acquisitions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions

while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2021 business combinations

business combinations

description

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

we use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as discounted cash flow to value amortizable intangible assets 

for significant acquisitions we may use independent thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed see note 3 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2021 business combinations

judgments and uncertainties

significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed particularly intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth operating margins attrition rates and discount rates based on historical results business plans expected synergies perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives

effect if actual results differ from assumptions

while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions which could result in subsequent impairments 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2021 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one

 

year period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance s heet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2021 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2021 

as of december 31 2021 we had 44480 million of borrowings outstanding under our various senior notes and note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2021 was 63901 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement long‑term debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purpose of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us 

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet based on a hypothetical onepercentage point change in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2021 a onepercentage point decrease would result in an estimated fair value of 69540 million or 9060 million more than their current carrying value a onepercentage point increase would result in an estimated fair value of 59052 million or 1428 million less than their current carrying value 

as of december 31 2021 we had 450 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement and 2284 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2021 and the resulting fair values are not materially different from their carrying value

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars please see item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding potential foreign exchange rate risks arising from brexit in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean and latin american operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2021 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 248 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2021 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 232 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss

 

historically we have not enter ed into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india  norway and the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2021 2020 and 2019  we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues through various future payment dates in addition during 2021 2020 and 2019  we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although t h ese hedging strateg ies were designed to protect us against significant uk  and india n currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged all of these hedges are accounted for in accordance with asc topic   815 “derivatives and hedging” and periodically are tested for effectiveness in accordance with such guidance in the scenario where such hedge does not pass the effectiveness test the hedge will be re  measured at the stated point and the appropriate loss if applicable would be recognized for the year ended december 31 2021 there has been no such effect on our consolidated financial presentation the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2021 2020 and 2019  see note 21 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of the se derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2021 2020 and 2 01 9

overview 

arthur j gallagher  co and its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as we our us or gallagher are engaged in providing insurance brokerage consulting and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to businesses and organizations around the world we believe that our major strength is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance insurance and risk management solutions superior claim outcomes and comprehensive consulting services to our clients 

our brokerage segment operations provide brokerage and consulting services to businesses and organizations of all types including commercial notforprofit and public entities and to a lesser extent individuals in the areas of insurance placement risk of loss management and management of employer sponsored benefit programs our risk management segment operations provide contract claim settlement claim administration loss control services and risk management consulting for commercial notforprofit captive and public entities and various other organizations that choose to selfinsure propertycasualty coverages or choose to use a thirdparty claims management organization rather than the claim services provided by an underwriting enterprise 

we do not assume underwriting risk on a net basis other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital to organize captives pools specialized underwriters or riskretention groups rather capital necessary for covering events of loss is provided by “underwriting enterprises” which we define as insurance companies reinsurance companies and various other risktaking entities including intermediaries of underwriting enterprises that we do not own or control 

since our founding in 1927 we have grown from a oneperson insurance agency to the world’s fourth largest insurance brokerrisk manager based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s julyaugust 2020 edition and one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators according to business insurance magazine’s may 2020 edition we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 74 14 and 12 respectively to 2020 revenues we generate approximately 68 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the united states us with the remaining 32 generated internationally primarily in the united kingdom uk australia canada new zealand and bermuda all of the revenues of the corporate segment are generated in the us

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from our brokerage operations and fees including performance‑based fees from our risk management operations the corporate segment generates revenues from our clean energy investments

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commissions fees supplemental revenues and contingent revenues and our costs to obtain and fulfill the service obligations to our clients can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of contracteffective dates on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of tax credits generated by our clean energy investments also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results 

brokerage segment

the brokerage segment accounted for 74 of our revenues in 2020 our brokerage segment operates through a network of more than 480 sales and service offices located throughout the us and more than 170 sales and service offices in 49 countries most of which are in the uk australia canada new zealand and bermuda most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel we also offer client service capabilities in more than 150 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants

competition 

brokerage segment

the insurance brokerage and consulting business is highly competitive and there are many organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise providing the actual service to the client and the overall cost to our clients we provide sophisticated data analysis to help our clients make insurance decisions through our electronic platform smartmarket we also provide insurance carriers with individualized preference setting and risk identification capabilities as well as performance data and metrics we believe these capabilities provide a growing competitive advantage with respect to many of the smaller organizations with which we compete 

risk management segment

our risk management operation currently ranks as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s may 2020 edition we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position are our ability to deliver better claim outcomes reputation for outstanding service costefficient service and financial strength

business combinations

clients

our client base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities in 2020 our largest single client represented approximately 10 and our ten largest clients together represented approximately 30 of our combined brokerage and risk management segment revenues 

 

 

human capital

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management of our nearly 1000 office locations nearly 400 are open but most of those at reduced capacity accordingly the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely for some or all of their work week we have instituted safety protocols and procedures for employees when they are in an office and have not had any officewide outbreaks of covid19

as of december 31 2020 we had 32401 employees with approximately 50 in the us and 50 outside of the us approximately 76 of our employees work in our brokerage segment and 20 in our risk management segment our remaining employees work in our corporate segment primarily in our home office and financial services division as well as in our service centers in india and elsewhere around the world in 2020 our total compensation expense was 28825 million for the brokerage segment and 5175 million for the risk management segment representing 558 and 630 respectively of brokerage and risk management segment revenues additional information regarding compensation expense both on a reported and an adjusted basis can be found elsewhere in this report under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

while many of our new employees come to us through mergers and acquisitions and traditional hiring “growing our own” has long been a key part of our human capital strategy our summer internship program began more than fifty years ago with a single intern since then our program has grown globally and we employed more than 400 interns each summer in 2018 and 2019 we had fewer interns in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic we provide our interns with professional development and onthejob sales training that gives them the opportunity to cultivate expertise and accelerate their fulltime sales career growth

as of december 31 2020 approximately 598 of our employees were women including 473 of managers and 402 of producers in the us approximately 236 of our employees were raciallyethnically diverse including 144 of managers and 189 of producers

regulation

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the sec the department of justice doj the irs the office of foreign assets control and the federal trade commission in the us the financial conduct authority in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our retirementrelated consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges 

regulations promulgated by the us treasury department pursuant to fatca require us to take various measures relating to nonus funds transactions and accounts

 item 1a  risk factors

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results such as revenues and net earnings cash flows liquidity and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations in addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks

risks relating to our business generally

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

the global spread of covid19 including potentially more contagious strains of covid19 such as those recently detected in the uk south africa and brazil has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors many of which are not within our control and which we may not be able to accurately predict including its duration and scope the ultimate availability administration and effectiveness of vaccines and our employees’ and the general population’s willingness to receive them governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response the effect on our clients and client demand for our services our ability to sell and provide our services including limitations on travel and difficulties of our clients and employees working from home the ability of our clients to pay their insurance premiums which could impact our commission and fee revenues for our services the nature and extent of claims impacting the ability of underwriting enterprises to pay supplemental and contingent commissions the decrease in new arising workers’ compensation and general liability claims the longterm impact of closing our offices and our employees working from home including increased technology costs the impact of lost revenue on our employees’ variable and base compensation levels the impact of uncertainty related to salary raises and future compensation levels the impact of reduced investments and postponements related to business modernization projects the impact of furloughed or terminated employees and the impact of reduced advertising and sponsorship investments



 



 



covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic as well as reactions to future pandemics or new strains or resurgences of covid19 could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this report which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price further covid19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations

 

an economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

apart from the impact of covid19 a decline in economic activity for any other reason including climate change or the uncertainty caused by political violence and chaos could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage and consulting services that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors any such reduction or decline whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in certain industries or in certain countries and regions in which we operate could adversely impact our commission revenues consulting revenues or revenues from managing thirdparty insurance claims some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

the exit of the uk from the european union brexit could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

the uk formally left the european union eu on january 31 2020 and an agreed implementation period ended on december 31 2020 although the uk and the eu reached a trade and customs agreement this agreement did not extend to insurance brokerage services accordingly while our european economic area eea client base is a small part of our uk operations we have now transferred those clients to a swedish subsidiary authorized in the eea some services will be provided through staff working in a uk branch of the subsidiary although this “reverse branch” model is typical of other brokers of a similar size there can be no assurance that the approach of eu regulators will not change potentially requiring us to adjust our plans in relation to the uk branch and causing further management distraction and cost in such an event our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risktaking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we have a significant amount of receivables from certain of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance if those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations the failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients further the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage for example because of large payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas overall risktaking capital capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability 

 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefit consulting firms and to a lesser extent claim and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations  

our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth particularly in our brokerage segment and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms private equitybacked consolidators and newly public insurance brokers one of which has a partnership tax structure that gives it an advantage in pricing acquisitions has in some cases made and could in the future make appropriate acquisition targets more difficult to identify and more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of larger acquisitions than we have historically see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for information regarding the size of transactions in the reporting period 

postacquisition risks include poor cultural fit and risks relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar or complex markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology pay equity human resources or employee attrition some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as casanueva perez sap de cv in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses

the insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world three of the firms we compete with in the global risk management and brokerage markets two of which are in the process of merging subject to regulatory approval have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms over the past decade or more private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones across all of our operations insurtech and technologybased startups are entering the business in most cases these businesses complement or enhance our offerings but in some cases they compete with us 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client and our ability to help our clients manage their overall risk exposure and insurance costs losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business

consolidation among our existing competitors such as the pending merger between aon and willis towers watson could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us 

these developments include 





 

 











new competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided

contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations

a meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period generally in the first or second quarter based on the growth andor profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year on the other hand supplemental revenues are paid up front on an annual or quarterly basis generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement while underwriting enterprises generally maintain supplemental revenues in the current year at a predetermined rate that rate can change in future years as described above if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability volume or growth thresholds as the case may be or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations in the case of contingent revenues under revenue recognition accounting standards this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods 

 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology these may include new applications or insurancerelated services based on artificial intelligence machine learning robotics blockchain or new approaches to data mining we may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants for example through disintermediation or new entrants such as technology companies “insurtech” startup companies and others these new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate we must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses investments in technology systems for example technology and cybersecurity investments we are making in response to the ransomware incident referred to elsewhere in this report may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs

in some cases we depend on key thirdparty vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is one of our key assets we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service ability to protect client information trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities such as culture and values our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees investors regulators and the communities in which we operate negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above including our association with clients or business partners with damaged reputations or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees could damage our reputation our reputation could also be harmed by negative perceptions or publicity regarding esg matters including concerns with environmental matters climate change workforce diversity pay equity harassment racial justice cyber security and data privacy any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients employees or investors result in lower esg ratings and exclusion of our stock from esgoriented indices or investment funds or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent including our senior management team

we depend upon members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy we could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders including our chief executive officer or if one or more of them contracts covid19 we could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace throughout our organization competition for talent in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering is particularly intense in addition our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers along with their clients business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition we enter into agreements with many of our brokers and significant clientfacing employees and all of our executive officers which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information andor soliciting our clients prospects and employees upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements although we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action such legal actions may not be effective in preventing such breaches theft or infringement our failure to adequately address any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition see also “ risks related to remote work” in our covid19 risk factor above 

 

 

our substantial operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us

in 2020 we generated approximately 32 of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the us the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations outside the us or create difficulties in staffing and managing such operations for example we have substantial operations in india that provide important services for other parts of our global organization to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region rising tensions between india and china incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to























 

 







the trade and military policies of the us government could further develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above or introduce new risks for our international operations if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

we face a variety of risks in our risk management thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic caused a reduction in the number of claims we processed negatively impacting our third party claims administration operations to a greater degree than the rest of our business this disproportionate negative impact could continue into 2021 our third party claims administration operations also face a variety of additional risks distinct from those faced by the rest of our business including the risks that 

















if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

 

we face a variety of risks in our benefit consulting operations distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage operations

 

our benefit consulting operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations the portion of our revenue derived from consulting engagements and special project work is more vulnerable to reduction postponement cancellation or nonrenewal during an economic downturn than traditional insurance brokerage commissions and we did experience such a reduction in 2020 if the economy is slow to recover in 2021 we could experience further deterioration in these sources of revenue certain areas within our retirement consulting practice may attract a higher level of regulatory scrutiny due to regulators’ historical interest in such matters including pensionrelated products and investment advisory and brokerdealer services in addition we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employersponsored healthcare new laws or regulations reducing employersponsored health insurance could impact 

 

clients’ demand for our services if we are unable to adapt our services to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employersponsored healthcare our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability

business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations damage our reputation and impact client relationships 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business such a disruption could be caused by a cybersecurity incident for example see details regarding a ransomware incident we experienced in 2020 in the cybersecurity risk factor below human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political violence and unrest in the us or elsewhere around the world or war our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us see our covid19 risk factor above

for example our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs® our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services in addition we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors a disruption affecting risxfacs® thirdparty cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business including key customer relationship management software could have a material adverse effect on our operations cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships

 

climate risks including the risk of an economic crisis risks associated with the physical effects of climate change and disruptions caused by the transition to a lowcarbon economy could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

 

the us federal reserve recently identified climate change as a systemic risk to the economy it also reported that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment which could create unpredictable followon effects in financial markets if this occurred not only would we be negatively impacted by the general economic decline but a drop in the stock market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock

 

the transition to a lowcarbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business our clients in such industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurancerelated or consulting services which could adversely impact our commission revenues consulting revenues or revenues from managing thirdparty insurance claims negative publicity arising from our clean coal investments or our association with clients in disfavored businesses or industries or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks facing gallagher or on reducing our own carbon emissions could damage our reputation with investors clients employees and regulators in addition the transition to a lowcarbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies if we fail to innovate in response to these changes we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do

 

 

 

we do not assume net underwriting risk other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital and thus do not experience direct material financial implications related to extreme weather events in addition we are a professional services firm with people as our most important asset and limited physical operations however if underwriting enterprises fail or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage because of large payouts related to climate change overall risktaking capital capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability 

 

see our risk factors further below related to our investments in irc section 45 clean coal operations for information regarding the potential risk of liability for environmental damage which could be exacerbated by a heightened focus on climate change

regulatory legal and accounting risks

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and intellectual property 

we rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities including our secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity or data breaches of certain of the systems on which we rely have occurred although to date we have not been materially impacted by any such breach in the future breaches of any such thirdparty system may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions 

we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as computer viruses or unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and privacy incidents such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data which to date have not had a material impact on our business see “update on ransomware incident” elsewhere in this report for information regarding an incident that occurred in 2020 

additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling privacy and security policies and protocols which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack 

in the future any material cybersecurity or data incidents or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of clients and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses such incidents could result in confidential personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen used to perpetuate fraud maliciously made public surreptitiously modified or rendered inaccessible for a period of time as we experienced in connection with the 2020 ransomware incident referred to above during a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance it is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives policies and resources and employee training the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase and as technology changes as these threats evolve cybersecurity and data incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation

with respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors we have processes designed to require third party it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or 

 

unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access correct and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations eg fines of up to 4 of worldwide revenue under the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and to 7500 per intentional violation under the california consumer privacy act ccpa in the us there is pending federal legislation and several states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the gdpr and ccpa 

in addition in the us legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws for example we are subject to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity regulation for financial services companies and ccpa india and other countries where we have operations outside the us have also proposed sweeping new data protection laws in some cases including data localization laws that may require that personal data stay within their borders 

complying with enhanced obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws is resulting in significant costs of developing implementing or securing our servers and is requiring us to allocate more resources to new privacy compliance processes and to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the sec the doj the irs the office of foreign assets control and the federal trade commission in the us the financial conduct authority in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our retirementrelated consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients underwriting enterprises and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties andor the loss of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges for example china recently adopted a “blocking” statute similar to that of the eu prohibiting compliance with certain us laws while we do not have operations in china rising global tensions and protectionism may lead other countries where we do have operations to adopt similar measures which could make it more difficult and costly for us to expand our operations globally see also “the exit of the uk from the european union brexit could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” above

 

c hanges in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies or the failure of state and local governments to follow through on agreedupon state and local tax credits or other tax related incentives could adversely affect our results of operations or require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business  

for example the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises  separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them  future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients underwriting enterprises or other business partners

on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tcja which significantly revised the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries in light of the results of the recent us presidential and congressional elections the us may pass legislation reversing part or all of the tcja and corresponding regulations and our tax rate could increase 

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws sanctioned parties restrictions and fatca

in countries outside the us a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption in such parts of the world in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

 

our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance including investigating business practices and taking steps to address the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies andor such laws and regulations we use third party partners and agents in certain jurisdictions where it is common industry practice to do so violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm although we have not been materially impacted by any such violations within the past year we investigated certain business practices that violated our policies and terminated those found to be involved

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the us the eu and other jurisdictions in which we operate in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees and our failure to do so properly could result in penalties 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are or have been subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage including with respect to business interruption or other potential coverage for covid‑19 losses report claims on behalf of clients provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory pension and claims handling services there is the risk that our employees or subagents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decisionmaking services to clients if these clients experience investment losses our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business where appropriate we have established provisions against these matters that we 

 

believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments  the damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages  it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results  in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure  we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters  accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable  these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant  

as more fully described in note 17 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services business has been under investigation by the irs since 2013  in addition we are defending a lawsuit along with chemmod llc and other defendants asserting infringement of patents held by midwest energy emissions corp and mes inc we cannot reasonably predict the outcomes of these or other matters that we may become involved with in the future an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to revenue recognition and deferred costs  see note 4 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes revenue recognition deferred costs stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements further as additional guidance relating to the tcja is released or if the current us president’s administration takes action to reverse portions of the tcja our estimates related to the tcja may change additionally changes in accounting standards such as the changed lease standards  see note 2 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

our ability to generate returns claim tax deductions and avoid writeoffs in connection with our irc section 45 and irc section 29 investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties including those set forth below our irc section 45 investments’ ability to generate additional tax credits is scheduled to end in december 2021



 











 

we began generating tax credits under irc section 45 in 2009 as of december 31 2020 we had generated a total of 15127 million in irc section 45 tax credits of which approximately 5349 million have been used to offset us federal tax liabilities and 9778 million remain unused and available to offset future us federal tax liabilities our ability to use tax credits under irc section 45 depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in irc section 45 these include among others the “placedinservice” condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal while we have received some degree of confirmation from the irs relating to our ability to claim these tax credits the irs could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied or have not continued to satisfy the conditions set forth in irc section 45 similarly the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our prior synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 at december 31 2020 we had exposure with respect to 1080 million of previously earned tax credits under irc section 29 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand 

 

these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them in addition the irs audited certain of the irc section   29 facilities without requiring any changes 

while none of our prior irc section 29 operations are currently under audit several of the irc section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the irs see “irs audits” above the irs could place the remaining irc section 45 operations and any of the prior irc section 29 operations under audit an adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in irc section 29 tax credits

the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals there are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability failure of the chemmod™ solution utilized at coalfired generation facilities for example could result in violations of air emissions permits which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability additionally some environmental laws without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct impose liability on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chem‑mod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation for example claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance in addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators or other end users will result in that facility owner or operator or other end user accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators or other end users will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and this could result in environmental or product liability claims it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage nuisance diminution of property value or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim and defense of such claims can be costly even when such defense prevails if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2020 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 45 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time our debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates a small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate in both cases currently based on libor which is expected to transition at the end of 2021 to the secured overnight financing rate  which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to stockholders acquisitions capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that 

 

would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all  

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock

further we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the us in the event we are unable to meet these us based cash requirements 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient manner

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

an important way we grow our business is through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units performance stock units options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest our stockholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” beginning on page 34 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and consulting services and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients and we do not assume net underwriting risks we are headquartered in rolling meadows illinois have operations in 49 countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in 2020 we expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth we generate approximately 68 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 32 generated internationally primarily in the uk australia canada new zealand and bermuda based on 2020 revenues we expect that our international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues in 2021 will be comparable to 2020 we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 74 14 and 12 respectively to 2020 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds clean energy investments and interest income from premium financing 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements

 

prior year discussion of results and comparisons

for information on fiscal 2018 results and similar comparisons see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019

 

 

 

 

summary of financial results  year ended december 31 

see the reconciliations of nongaap measures on page 30

 



 

in our corporate segment net after tax earnings from our clean energy investments was 698 million and 885 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively our current estimate of the 2021 annual net after tax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2021 is 600 million to 750 million we expect to use the additional cash flow generated by these earnings to continue our mergers and acquisition strategy in our core brokerage and risk management operations 

 

the following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing revenues before reimbursements  net earnings ebitdac and diluted net earnings per share for 2020 and 2019  in addition these tables provide reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues adjusted ebitdac and adjusted diluted net earnings per share reconciliations of ebitdac for the brokerage and risk management segments are provided on pages 3 7 and 4 2 of this filing 

 



 



 

for 2019 the pretax impact of the brokerage segment adjustments totals 69 million with no corresponding adjustment to the provision for income taxes relating to these items the pretax impact of the risk management segment adjustments totals 56 million with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for income taxes of 15 million relating to these items the pretax impact of the corporate segment adjustments totals 179 million with an adjustment to the benefit for income taxes of 39 million for the corporate segment the clean energy related adjustments are described on page 47

covid19 impact 

in our propertycasualty brokerage operations during fourth quarter 2020 a our customer retention remained at pre‑pandemic levels b new business generation was above prepandemic levels offset somewhat by nonrecurring business that was below pre‑pandemic levels c renewal exposure units ie insured values payrolls employees miles driven etc declined however premium rates across most geographies and lines of coverage have continued to increase effectively mitigating exposure unit declines and d net positive midterm policy modifications were slightly higher than fourth quarter 2019 

thus far in the first quarter of 2021 propertycasualty customer exposure unit renewals showed improvement compared to lows seen in april and may 2020 as our customers’ businesses continue to recover and economic activity increases full policy cancellations have remained similar to prepandemic levels and we continue to see propertycasualty premium rates move higher overall which may partially or fully offset future declines in exposure units if any

 

 

in our employee benefits brokerage operations during the fourth quarter of 2020 we saw a decrease in new consulting and special project work while covered lives on renewal business were similar to the third quarter of 2020 our january 1 2021 health and welfare renewals have shown covered lives being consistent with levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2020 although still not at prepandemic levels consulting engagements and special project work improved slightly from fourth quarter levels but are still below pre‑pandemic levels we believe revenue softness related to reduced covered lives and lower frequency of special project work could persist over the next few quarters and even deteriorate further if the economy is slow to recover 

in our risk management operations we began seeing a meaningful decline in new claims arising during the last two weeks of march 2020 which persisted into april from may to december 2020 we saw an improving trend in new claims arising and higher covid‑related workers compensation claims yet the current level of weekly new claims so far in 2021 is still below prepandemic levels a slower recovery or reversal in the number of workers employed could cause fewer claims to arise in future quarters

throughout 2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2020 our clean energy investments experienced the impact of lower electricity consumption in the us when compared to the same periods in 2019 due to reduced economic activity as well as unrelated to covid19 milder temperatures other than some brief periods of unusually warm weather falling natural gas prices and increased use of renewable energy sources we expect reduced us electricity consumption could persist at least through the first half of 2021 and could even continue throughout all of 2021 

of our nearly 1000 office locations nearly 400 are open but most at reduced capacity accordingly the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely for some or all of their work week we believe our service levels are unchanged from prepandemic levels we have not had any officewide outbreaks of covid19 and fewer than 300 confirmed cases among our 32401 employees  all of which we believe contracted the virus outside of our office locations 

given the deterioration in economic conditions since the first quarter of 2020 we are actively managing costs by limiting discretionary spending such as travel entertainment and advertising expenses adjusting our real estate footprint reducing capital expenditures limiting use of outside labor and consultants increasing utilization of our centers of excellence and we have adjusted portions of our workforce where volumes have declined significantly and normal attrition was not sufficient 

the cost saving impact of these actions in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 was substantial with estimated quarterly savings of approximately 65 million to 70 million pretax compared to the same quarters in 2019 as adjusted for pro forma full‑quarter costs related to acquisitions offsetting these savings were severance and lease termination costs related to these actions we believe savings in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 could again total approximately 60 million to 65 million pretax after adjusting for pro forma costs related to acquisitions offsetting possible future savings would be additional implementation and execution costs which we estimate could total approximately 12 million to 15 million pretax future net savings may be lower if the economy recovers faster than we are forecasting or our costs to implement changes exceed our estimates

we have not seen any meaningful decline in cash receipts from our clients to date and we have more than 16 billion of available liquidity a prolonged period of economic weakness may cause future cash collections to deteriorate but we believe our cost savings reduced nonclient facing capital expenditures and working capital improvements could mitigate a potential decline in our cash flows over the near‑term

update on ransomware incident

as previously disclosed on september 26 2020 we detected a ransomware incident impacting our internal systems we implemented our incident response plan took our global systems offline isolated impacted systems retained cyber security counsel and forensic experts and reported the event to the fbi the incident has been contained and all critical systems are back in service 

while we remain unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of information our investigation into the incident remains ongoing we are working to conclude our forensic investigation and determine the nature and extent of unauthorized access to information on our systems we intend to comply with all applicable laws and regulations based on the results of the forensic investigation to date we do not believe this incident will have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage but disputes over the extent of insurance coverage for claims are not uncommon furthermore while we have not been the subject of any legal proceedings involving this incident it is possible we could be the subject of claims from persons alleging they suffered damages from the incident or actions by governmental authorities

 

 

insurance market overview

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty underwriting enterprises have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises  increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas as markets harden buyers of insurance such as our brokerage clients have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate including by raising their deductibles andor reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures

we typically cite the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab insurance pricing quarterly survey at this time as an indicator of the current insurance rate environment the fourth quarter 2020 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report the first three 2020 quarterly surveys indicated that us commercial propertycasualty rates increased by 93 108 and 117 on average for the first second and third quarters of 2020 respectively we expect a similar trend to be noted when the ciab fourth quarter 2020 survey report is issued which would signal overall continued price firming and hardening in some items the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

we believe the increases in propertycasualty rates experienced in 2020 will continue in 2021 however loss trends could deteriorate leading to a more difficult environment and in certain lines and geographies a hard market the economies of the us and other countries around the world contracted during 2020 as a result of covid19 and have yet to rebound to prepandemic levels weaker economic activity is leading to and is likely to continue to lead to reduced exposure units and elevated unemployment we expect that our history of strong new business generation solid retentions and enhanced valueadded services for our carrier partners should help offset to a degree softer global economic conditions overall we believe that in a positive rate environment with reduced exposure units our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and highquality valueadded capabilities by strengthening our clients’ insurance portfolios and delivering insurance and risk management solutions within our clients’ budget based on our experience there is adequate capacity in the insurance market for most lines of coverage terms and conditions are tightening most insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions and clients can broadly still obtain coverage 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and six clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party all 35 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants received tax credits through 2019 and the 21 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 all twentyone of the 2011 era plants are under long‑term production contracts with several utilities 

we also own a 465 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chem‑mod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 50 million to 60 million of net after tax earnings per quarter for the first three quarters of 2021

our current estimate of the 2021 annual net after tax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2020 is 600 million to 750 million 

 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factor s regarding our irc sectio n 45 investment s under item 1a “risk factors  ” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies

revenue recognition  see revenue recognition in notes 1 and 4 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements 

income taxes  see income taxes in notes 1 and 19 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 19 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements on july 22 2020 the uk enacted the finance act and stamp duty land tax which maintained the uk corporate tax rate at 19 from april 1 2020 previously planned to be reduced to 17 on that date accordingly we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in third quarter 2020 to reflect this rate change

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable see note 19 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements related to changes in our valuation allowances

intangible assetsearnout obligations  see intangible assets in note 1 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements 

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements which is a level 3 fair value 

 

measurement  in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our 2020 consolidated financial s tatements for additional discussion on our 2020 business combinations 

business combinations and dispositions

see note 3 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2020 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2018 

on january 8 2019 we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014 in first quarter 2019 we recognized a onetime net gain of 017 of diluted net earnings per share as a result of the sale

results of operations

information regarding nongaap measures and other

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted adjusted eps adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition because they provide investors with measures that our chief operating decision maker uses when reviewing the company’s performance and for the other reasons described below our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided we make determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer incentive compensation performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted ebitdac 

adjusted nongaap presentation  we believe that the adjusted nongaap presentation of our 2020 and 2019 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period 













 









nongaap earnings measures

we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segment each as defined below provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance adjusted eps is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity we also consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as ways to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis in addition adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability







organic revenues a nongaap measure   for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations in each year presented these revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or are due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2021 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk 

 

management segments we also believe that using this nongaap measure allows readers of our financial statement s to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 

reconciliation of nongaap information presented to gaap measures  this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac before acquisitions diluted net earnings per share as adjusted and organic revenue measures 

brokerage 

the brokerage segment accounted for 74 of our revenue in 2020 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our brokerage segment generates revenues by 









the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans commissions depend upon a large number of factors including the type of risk being placed the particular underwriting enterprise’s demand the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract rather than being tied to the amount of premiums fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide our services in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenues supplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria contingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period

irs and doj investigations  as previously disclosed our irc 831b or “microcaptive” advisory services business has been under investigation by the irs since 2013 among other matters the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations additionally the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year and subsequent tax years of over 100 of the microcaptive underwriting enterprises organized andor managed by us in may 2020 we learned that the doj is conducting a criminal investigation related to irc 831b microcaptive underwriting enterprises we have been advised that we are not currently a target of the investigation in june 2020 our subsidiary artex risk solutions inc which we refer to as artex received a grand jury subpoena requesting documents relating to its microcaptive advisory business we have produced documents in response to the subpoena we are fully cooperating with both the irs investigation and the doj investigation we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with these investigations 

class action lawsuit  on december 7 2018 a class action lawsuit was filed against us artex and other defendants in the united states district court for the district of arizona the named plaintiffs are microcaptives and their related entities and owners who had irc section 831b tax benefits disallowed by the irs on august 5 2019 the trial court granted the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and dismissed the class action lawsuit plaintiffs appealed this ruling to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on september 9 2020 the ninth circuit affirmed the ruling of the trial court dismissing the class action lawsuit we will continue to defend against the lawsuit vigorously litigation is inherently uncertain however and it is not possible for us to predict 

 

the ultimate outcome of this matter and the financial impact to us  nor are we able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this lawsuit

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2020 and 2019 we recognized 320 million and 262 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2020 and 2019 acquisitions during 2020 and 2019 we recognized 617 million and 93 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 131 and 112 acquisitions respectively 

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2016 to 2020 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to three‑year period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income

interest expense limitation  the cares act contains modifications on the limitations of business interest for tax years beginning in 2019 and 2020 the modifications to section 163j increase the allowable business interest deduction from 30 of adjusted taxable income to 50 of adjusted taxable income this modification would significantly increase the allowable interest expense deduction of the company we have evaluated the impact and determined there is no limit on our interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2020 and 2019 operating results for the corporate segment in millions

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and six clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party all 35 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod llc we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the 14 2009 era plants received tax credits through 2019 and the 21 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2020 in millions

 



 

the estimated earnings information in the table reflects management’s current best estimate of the 2020 low and high ranges of aftertax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities other operating assumptions including current us federal income tax laws however coalfired power plants may not ultimately produce refined fuel at estimated levels due to seasonal electricity demand production costs natural gas prices weather conditions as well as many other operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates

our investment in chemmod llc generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates 

we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to coinvestors and relinquish control of the plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling minority investor the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control as of any future date we become a noncontrolling minority investor we would deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting

we currently have construction commitments related to our refined coal plants of approximately 09 million

 

there is a provision in irc sectio n 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 



 



see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 14 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments

financial condition and liquidity

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

in light of the economic uncertainty caused by covid19 subsequent to the first quarter of 2020 we preserved liquidity during 2020 by reducing capital expenditures for the remainder of the year and made working capital process changes such as moved more cash into the us from our international operations pursued collections on receivables from our customers and partners and renegotiated longer payment terms on vendor payables we also slowed down our acquisition program in the second and third quarters of 2020 we believe we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this uncertain period if we experience a significant reduction in revenue in the future we have additional alternatives to maintain liquidity including use of common stock to fund future acquisitions

cash flows from operating activities

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2020 2019 and 2018 we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and issuances of our common stock 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 17525 million 11192 million and 7651 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to timing differences between periods in the collection of other current receivables and payments on current liabilities during 2020 we managed our working capital in terms of receivables and payables as a cautionary step to protect liquidity during this uncertain period in addition during 2020 the company filed a refund claim under a cares act provision that accelerates the ability of companies to recover amt credits and we received a 285 million refund related to our amt credit carryovers which was the remaining amount owed to us under the cares act we also elected to defer the payment of 516 million of employer payroll tax obligations incurred in 2020 into 2021 and 2022 this also defers our income tax deduction related to these employer payroll taxes 

 

which results in an unfavorable temporary income tax adjustment of  129 million that will reverse in the year that the payroll taxes are paid we a lso deferred  180   million of estimated federal income tax payments from second quarter 2020 to third quarter 2020 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to the following items decreases in 2019 compared to 2018 of 480 million of payments on acquisition earnouts in excess of original estimates 459 million of income tax payments and 300 million discretionary contribution made to our defined benefit plan in 2018 also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 were timing differences between years in the collection of receivables and direct bill revenues and the payment of accrued liabilities 

in addition cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was favorably impacted by timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of client fiduciary related balances in 2020 compared to 2019 the following table summarizes two lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2020 2019 and 2018 in millions

 



 

our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted if the amount of irc section 45 tax credits generated which is the amount we recognize for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount of tax credits actually used to reduce our tax cash obligations excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities please see “clean energy investments” below for more information on their potential future impact on cash provided by operating activities 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings  adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 15968 million 12956 million and 10464 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 8188 million 6688 million and 6335 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2020 2019 and 2018 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2018 we made a 300 million discretionary contribution to the plan in order to minimize the potential impact of having to make required minimum contributions to the plan in future periods during 2020 and 2019 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan 

see note 13 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in 

 

funded sta tus of the plans  including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in 2020 the funded status of the plan was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2020 the net impact of which was approximately 150 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2020 than anticipated by approximately 179 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2020 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2020 of 29 million in 2019 the funded status of the plan was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2019 the net impact of which was approximately 213 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2019 than anticipated by approximately 238 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2019 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2019 of 25 million while the change in funded status of the plan had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2020 2019 and 2018 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 993 million 1388 million and 1244 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in addition 2020 and 2019 capital expenditures include amounts incurred related to investments made in information technology and software development projects relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters we received property tax related credits under a taxincrement financing note from rolling meadows illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit incentives from these two programs could total between 600 million and 900 million over a fifteenyear period in 2021 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 1500 million part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash and restricted cash acquired was 3243 million 12668 million and 7848 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in the number and size of acquisitions in 2020 than occurred in 2019 the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of acquisitions in 2019 than occurred in 2018 in addition during 2020 2019 and 2018 we issued 30 million shares 3061 million 19 million shares 1661 million and 08 million shares 608 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 27 49 and 48 acquisitions in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2020 2019 and 2018 totaled approximately 2514 million 4682 million and 3398 million respectively in 2021 we expect to use new debt our credit agreement cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete 

we significantly reduced our acquisition activity in the second and third quarters of 2020 because of the economic uncertainty brought on by covid19 and if liquidity concerns arise we could use common stock to fund future acquisitions

 

dispositions  during 2020 2019 and 2018 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime losses gains of 58 million of losses and 753 million and 102 million of gains respectively on december 16 2020 we completed the sale of a uk wealth management business that we purchased over four years ago that no longer strategically fit in our benefits operations in fourth quarter 2020 we recognized a net pretax noncash loss on sale of approximately 120 million primarily due to the writeoff of the remaining net book value of the amortizable intangible assets 

we received cash proceeds of 82 million 810 million and 145 million respectively related to these transactions 

on january 8 2019 we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014 in first quarter 2019 we recognized a onetime net gain of 017 of diluted net earnings per share as a result of the sale

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2020 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate of the 2021 annual net aftertax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2020 is 600 million to 750 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants by any capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2021 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time nonetheless if current ownership interests remain the same if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined 

 

coal plants remain as currently anticipated  and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2021 through at least 2025  while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see clean energy investments on page s   4 8 and 49 for a more detailed description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties

the note purchase agreements the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2020

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2020 we declared 3484 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 180 per common share on december 18 2020 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 045 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 4 2020 on january 27 2021 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2021 of 048 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 048 per common share throughout 2021 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2021 of 

 

approximately  3705 million based on the outstanding shares as of decembe r 31  2020  or a n anticipated in crease in cash used of approximately  231   million compared to 2020  we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

shelf registration statement  on november 15 2019 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any shares under this registration statement on november 15 2016 we also filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 with the sec registering 100 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses assets or securities at december 31 2020 43 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the year ended december 31 2018 we repurchased 01 million shares of our common stock at cost of 113 million under the provisions of the repurchase plan we are authorized to repurchase approximately 73 million additional shares at december 31 2020 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 1119 million in 2020 1012 million in 2019 and 819 million in 2018 on may 16 2017 our stockholders approved the 2017 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2014 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 114 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip  23 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of december 31 2020 were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2020 our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital and access to additional capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs 

 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 8 14 and 17 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2020 are as follows in millions 

 



 

the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation as of december 31 2020 we had a 482 million accrued liability related to the ashton tiffany acquisition that is not in the foregoing table that may be settled using shares of our common stock in early february 2021 

in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2020 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities see note 19 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes

see note 8 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements

offbalance sheet arrangements

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2020 are as follows in millions 

 



 

since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 17 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all but one of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date  

on december 23 2020 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100 of the equity of the bollington wilson group which we refer to as bollington headquartered in sale greater manchester uk for approximately 3300 million of cash consideration the transaction is subject to regulatory approval which we received on january 26 2021 and is expected to close in february 2021

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 583 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2016 to 2020 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price 

 

consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was  11281 million of which  5922 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of decembe r 31  2020  based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made  of which approximately  4937 million can be settled in cash or stock at our option and  985 million must be settled in cash    

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2020 and 2019 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2020 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 94 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 175 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2020 we had posted seven letters of credit totaling 75 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements plus additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity one letter of credit totaling 10 million for collateral related to claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity by a recent acquisition and one letter of credit totaling 05 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisition’s lease these letters of credit have never been drawn upon




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2020 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2020 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2020 

as of december 31 2020 we had 43480 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2020 was 50189 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement long‑term debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purpose of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us 

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet based on a hypothetical onepercentage point change in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2020 a onepercentage point decrease would result in an estimated fair value of 53459 million or 9979 million more than their current carrying value a onepercentage point increase would result in an estimated fair value of 47200 million or 3720 million more than their current carrying value 

 

as of december 31 2020  we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement and  2036 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2020  because these are shortterm borrowings with variable interest rates the estimated fair values of these borrowings approximate their carrying value 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars please see item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding potential foreign exchange rate risks arising from brexit in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean and latin american operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2020 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 251 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2020 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 198 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss

historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india norway and the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2020 2019 and 2018 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues through various future payment dates in addition during 2020 2019 and 2018 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and indian currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged all of these hedges are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 815 “derivatives and hedging” and periodically are tested for effectiveness in accordance with such guidance in the scenario where such hedge does not pass the effectiveness test the hedge will be remeasured at the stated point and the appropriate loss if applicable would be recognized for the year ended december 31 2020 there has been no such effect on our consolidated financial presentation the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2020 2019 and 2018 see note 21 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2020 2019 and 2018

overview 

arthur j gallagher  co and its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as we our us or gallagher are engaged in providing insurance brokerage consulting and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to businesses and organizations around the world we believe that our major strength is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance insurance and risk management solutions superior claim outcomes and comprehensive consulting services to our clients 

our brokerage segment operations provide brokerage and consulting services to businesses and organizations of all types including commercial notforprofit

and public entities and to a lesser extent individuals in the areas of insurance placement risk of loss management and management of employer sponsored benefit programs our risk management segment operations provide contract claim settlement claim administration loss control services and risk management consulting for commercial notforprofit

captive and public entities and various other organizations that choose to selfinsure propertycasualty coverages or choose to use a thirdparty claims management organization rather than the claim services provided by an underwriting enterprise

we do not assume underwriting risk on a net basis other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital to organize captives pools specialized underwriters or riskretention groups rather capital necessary for covering events of loss is provided by “underwriting enterprises” which we define as insurance companies reinsurance companies and various other risktaking entities including intermediaries of underwriting enterprises that we do not own or control 

since our founding in 1927 we have grown from a oneperson

insurance agency to the world’s fourth largest insurance brokerrisk manager based on revenues according to business insurance 

magazine’s july 2019 edition and one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators according to business insurance

magazine’s may 2019 edition we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 68 14 and 18 respectively to 2019 revenues we generate approximately 69 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the united states us with the remaining 31 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the united kingdom uk all of the revenues of the corporate segment are generated in the us

shares of our common stock are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ajg” and we had a market capitalization at december 31 2019 of approximately 179 billion information in this report is as of december 31 2019 unless otherwise noted we were reincorporated as a delaware corporation in 1972 our executive offices are located at 2850 golf road rolling meadows illinois 600084050 and our telephone number is 630 7733800 

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from our brokerage operations and fees including performancebased 

fees from our risk management operations the corporate segment generates revenues from our clean energy investments

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commissions fees supplemental revenues and contingent revenues and our costs to obtain and fulfill the service obligations to our clients can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of contracteffective dates on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of tax credits generated by our clean energy investments also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 22 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2019 and 2018 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 68 of our revenues in 2019 we operate our brokerage segment operations through a network of more than 580 sales and service offices located throughout the us and more than 300 sales and service offices in 49 countries most of which are in australia canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel we also offer client service capabilities in more than 150 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 

our brokerage segment generates revenues by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the vast majority of our brokerage contracts and service understandings are for a period of one year or less 

commissions and fees 

the primary source of brokerage segment revenues is commissions from underwriting enterprises which are based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions 

commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premium for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans commissions depend upon a large number of factors including the type of risk being placed the particular underwriting enterprise’s demand the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract rather than being tied to the amount of premiums fees are typically based on an expected level of effort to provide our services 

whether we are paid a commission or a fee the vast majority of our services are associated with the placement of an insurance or insurancelike contract see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results 

supplemental revenues 

certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues based on the volume of premium we place with them and for insights into our sales pipeline our sales capabilities or our risk selection knowledge these amounts are in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above and not all business we place with underwriting enterprises is eligible for supplemental revenues see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results 

contingent revenues 

certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues for our sales capabilities our risk selection knowledge or our administrative efficiencies these amounts are in excess of the commission revenues discussed above and not all business we place with participating underwriting enterprises is eligible for contingent revenues unlike supplemental revenues also discussed above these revenues are variable generally based on growth the loss experience of the underlying insurance contracts andor our efficiency in processing the business see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results 

subbrokerage

costs 

subbrokerage

costs are excluded from our gross revenues in our determination of our total revenues subbrokerage

costs represent commissions paid to subbrokers

related to the placement of certain business by our brokerage segment operations we recognize this contra revenue in the same manner as the commission revenue to which it relates

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 82 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2019 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

our retail brokerage operations are organized and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 67 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups we serve are as follows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 18 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2019 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated

brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace

insurance these brokers operate through approximately 300 offices primarily located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for underwriting enterprises managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an underwriting enterprise to manage all or a part of its business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the underwriting enterprise may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance

more than 79 of our wholesale brokerage revenues comes from nonaffiliated

brokerage clients based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked the largest managing general agentsunderwriting managers lloyds coverholders according to business insurance 

magazine’s september 2019 edition

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 14 of our revenues in 2019 approximately 63 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers’ compensationrelated claims 28 are from general and commercial auto liabilityrelated claims and 9 are from propertyrelated claims in 2019 

risk management services are primarily marketed directly to fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies not for profit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations we manage our third party claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 70 offices located throughout the us australia new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients 

while this segment complements our brokerage and consulting offerings approximately 90 of our risk management segment’s revenues come from clients not affiliated with our brokerage operations such as underwriting enterprises and clients of other insurance brokers based on revenues our risk management operation ranked as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators according to business insurance

magazine’s may 2019 edition

revenues for our risk management segment are comprised of fees generally negotiated i on a perclaim

basis ii on a costplus basis or iii as performancebased fees we also provide risk management consulting services that are recognized as the services are delivered

perclaim

fees 

where we operate under a contract with our fee established on a perclaim

basis our obligation is to process claims for a term specified within the contract because it is impractical to recognize our revenues on an individual claimbyclaim

basis we recognize revenue plus an appropriate estimate of our profit margin on a portfolio basis by grouping claims with similar characteristics a practical expedient as defined in asu no 201409

revenue from contracts with customers which we refer to as topic 606 we apply actuariallydetermined historicalbased patterns to determine our future service obligations without applying a present value discount

costplus fees 

where we provide services and generate revenues on a costplus basis we recognize revenue over the contract period consistent with the performance of our obligations 

performancebased fees 

certain clients pay us additional fee revenues for our efficiency in managing claims or on the basis of claim outcome effectiveness these amounts are in excess of the fee revenues discussed above these revenues are variable generally based on various performance metrics of the underlying contracts we generally operate under multiyear contracts with fiscal year measurement periods we do not receive these fees if earned until the following year after verification of the performance metrics outlined in the contracts each period we base our estimates on a contractbycontract

basis we make our best estimate of amounts we have earned using historical averages and other factors to project such revenues variable consideration is recognized when we conclude that is it probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 18 of our revenues in 2019 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses other corporate costs and the impact of foreign currency translation the revenues reported by this segment result almost solely from our consolidated clean energy investments 

cleanenergy investments 

we own 34 commercial clean coal production facilities that are qualified to produce refined coal using chemmod

llc’s proprietary technologies these operations produce refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under internal revenue code which we refer to as irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expired as of december 31 2019 for 14 of our plants and will expire on or before december 31 2021 for the other 20 plants chemmod

llc described below is a privatelyheld enterprise that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we own 465 of chemmod

llc and are its controlling managing member we also have a 120 noncontrolling interest in dormant privatelyheld enterprises cquest

technology llc and cquest

technologies international llc which we refer to as together cquest

which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels at this time it is unclear if cquest

will ever become commercially viable

international and other brokerage related operations 

we operate as a retail commercial property and casualty broker throughout 45 locations in australia 42 locations in canada and 37 locations in new zealand in the uk we operate as a retail broker from approximately 135 locations we also have specialty wholesale underwriting and reinsurance intermediary operations in london for clients to access lloyd’s of london and other international underwriting enterprises and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities 

in bermuda we act principally as a wholesale broker for clients looking to access bermudabased underwriting enterprises and we also provide management and administrative services for captive insurance entities 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of independent brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through this global network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants we are able to serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in more than 150 countries around the world 

captive underwriting enterprises

 we have ownership interests in several underwriting enterprises based in the us bermuda gibraltar guernsey isle of man and malta that primarily operate segregated account “rentacaptive”

facilities these “rentacaptive”

facilities enable our clients to receive the benefits of participating in a captive underwriting enterprise without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive underwriting enterprises or “rentacaptive”

facilities are created for clients to insure their risks and capture any underwriting profit and investment income which would then be available for use by the insureds generally to reduce future costs of their insurance programs in general these companies are set up as protected cell companies that are comprised of separate cell business units which we refer to as captive cells and the core regulated company which we refer to as the core company the core company is owned and operated by us and no insurance policies are assumed by the core company all insurance is assumed or written within individual captive cells only the activity of the supporting core company of the rentacaptive

facility is recorded in our consolidated financial statements including cash and stockholder’s equity of the legal entity and any expenses incurred to operate the rentacaptive

facility most captive cells reinsure individual lines of insurance coverage from external underwriting enterprises in addition some captive cells offer individual lines of insurance coverage from one of our underwriting enterprise subsidiaries the different types of insurance coverage include special property general liability products liability medical professional liability other liability and medical stop loss the policies are generally claimsmade insurance policies are written by an underwriting enterprise and the risk is assumed by each of the captive cells in general we structure these operations to have no underwriting risk on a net written basis in situations where we have assumed underwriting risk on a net written basis we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for the underwriting risk we have assumed from our clients we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to limit our risk

we also have a wholly owned underwriting enterprise subsidiary based in the us that cedes all of its insurance risk of loss to reinsurers or captives under facultative and quotashare treaty reinsurance agreements while we believe these ceding reinsurance agreements displace all of our risk of loss they do not discharge us of our primary liability to our clients for example in the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies or captives are unable to meet their obligations we would be liable for such defaulted amounts therefore we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers or captives in order to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer credit risk and insolvencies we believe we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral typically requiring pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to offset the risk see note 18 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to the insurance activity of our wholly owned underwriting enterprise subsidiary for 2019 2018 and 2017 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance 

magazine’s july 2019 edition we were the world’s fourth largest insurance broker based on revenues the insurance brokerage and consulting business is highly competitive and there are many organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete globally with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis towers watson public limited company each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc usi holdings corporation and mcgriff insurance services fka bbt insurance services operate globally or nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our wholesale brokerage and binding operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc burns  wilcox ltd and all risks ltd as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers we also compete with certain underwriting enterprises that offer insurance and risk management products and solutions directly to clients in addition for our employee benefit consulting services we compete with larger firms such as aon plc mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis towers watson public limited company midmarket

firms such as lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation specialized consulting firms such as pearl meyer and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise providing the actual service to the client and the overall cost to our clients 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators based on revenues according to business insurance

magazine’s may 2019 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc and broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company several large underwriting enterprises such as chubb limited travelers companies inc and liberty mutual holding co inc also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position are our ability to deliver better claim outcomes reputation for outstanding service costefficient service and financial strength

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 556 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2019 most of which were within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local brokerages agencies or employee benefit consulting operations with a middle or small client focus andor significant expertise in one of our nichepractice groups the total purchase price for individual acquisitions has typically ranged from 10 million to 500 million 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

clients 

our client base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit

entities no material part of our business depends upon a single client or on a few clients the loss of any one client would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2019 our largest single client represented approximately 10 and our ten largest clients together represented approximately 20 of our combined brokerage and risk management segment revenues

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 33300 employees 

we enter into agreements with many of our brokerage salespersons and significant clientfacing employees plus all of our executive officers which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information andor soliciting our clients prospects and employees upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation

provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of noncompete

 item 1a risk factors 

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results such as revenues and net earnings cash flows liquidity and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations in addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

risks relating to our business generally 

an economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

a decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage and consulting services that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors in addition specific industries or sectors of the economy could experience declines in ways that impact our business for example if climate change and environmental risks harm certain industries like oil and gas our clients in those industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance coverage or consulting services to cite another example if an increase in consumer preference for car

and ridesharing services results in a longterm reduction in vehicle use the automobile insurance industry could decline any such reduction or decline whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in certain industries could adversely impact our commission revenues consulting revenues or revenues from managing thirdparty insurance claims some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected

the exit of the uk from the european union brexit could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations in the uk which contributed approximately 19 of our brokerage segment and approximately 4 of our risk management segment revenues in 2019 expose us to risk in the event of an economic downturn in the uk due to brexit such a downturn could adversely affect our uk operations through a decline in the insurance coverage and consulting services our clients purchase as they face reductions in their headcount payroll properties or the market value of their assets following approval by the european union and the uk parliaments the uk formally left the european union on january 31 2020 the uk is now expected to be in an implementation period until december 31 2020 any further extension would require uk legislation to be changed during this period the uk will still follow all the european union’s rules and regulations will remain in the single market and the customs union and will permit the free movement of people there is no formal stated intent by the uk or european economic area eea authorities to put in place at the end of the implementation period an arrangement under which ukbased insurance brokers will continue to be able to exercise “passporting rights” to provide services to clients in the eea accordingly while our eea client base is a small part of our uk operations our expectation is that eea clients will need to be serviced by a subsidiary authorized in the eea while we have a plan in place to transfer those clients to a swedish subsidiary such a transition could be a distraction to both clients and our management in addition under our business model in the uk some services will be provided through staff working in a uk branch of the subsidiary there can be no assurance that applicable eu regulations will not change potentially requiring us to adjust our plans and causing further management distraction and cost in addition the uncertainty surrounding brexit has and may continue to result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets which could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results and may lead to a sustained weakness in the british pound’s exchange rate against the us dollar any significant weakening of the british pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segments’ net earnings as reported in us dollars 

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risktaking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance if those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations the failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients and the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage for example because of large payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas overall risktaking capital capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefit consulting firms and to a lesser extent claim and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth particularly in our brokerage segment and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms private equitybacked consolidators and newly public insurance brokers one of which has a partnership tax structure that gives it an advantage in pricing acquisitions could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically 

postacquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology pay equity human resources employee attrition or poor organizational culture and fit some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as casanueva perez sap de cv in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world three of the firms we compete with in the global risk management and brokerage markets have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms over the past decade or more private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client and our ability to help our clients manage their overall insurance costs losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

consolidation among our existing competitors could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us 

these developments include 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

new competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated

brokers or agents such as us those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives

risk retention groups and noninsurance 

capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided

contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period generally in the first or second quarter based on the growth andor profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year on the other hand supplemental revenues are paid up front on an annual or quarterly basis generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability volume or growth thresholds as the case may be or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations in the case of contingent revenues under the changed revenue recognition accounting standard effective january 1 2018 this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods see note 2 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for more information 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology these may include new applications or insurancerelated services based on artificial intelligence machine learning robotics blockchain or new approaches to data mining we may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants for example through disintermediation or new entrants such as technology companies “insurtech” startup

companies and others these new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate we must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs

in some cases we depend on key thirdparty vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is one of our key assets we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service ability to protect client information trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities such as culture and values our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees investors and regulators negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees could damage our reputation our reputation could also be impacted by negative perceptions or publicity regarding environmental social and governance esg issues or cybersecurity and data privacy concerns any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients employees and investors or harm our relationships with regulators any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent including our senior management team 

we depend upon members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy we could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders including our chief executive officer we could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent throughout our organization competition for talent in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering is particularly intense in addition our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers along with their clients business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition our failure to adequately address any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our substantial operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

in 2019 we generated approximately 31 of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the us the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations outside the us or create difficulties in staffing and managing such operations for example we have substantial operations in india that provide important services for other parts of our global organization to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

the trade and military policies of the us government could further develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above or introduce new risks for our international operations if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations 

our third party claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risks that 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations damage our reputation and impact client relationships 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business such a disruption could be caused by human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins

sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest or war our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us

for example our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®

 our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services in addition we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors a disruption affecting risxfacs ®

 thirdparty cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and intellectual property 

we rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities including our secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity or data breaches of any of the systems on which we rely may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice

attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions

we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as computer viruses or unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and privacy incidents such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data which to date have not had a material impact on our business 

additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling privacy and security policies and protocols which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack in the future any material cybersecurity or data incidents or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of clients and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses such incidents could result in confidential personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen used to perpetuate fraud maliciously made public surreptitiously modified or rendered inaccessible for a period of time during a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance it is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives policies and resources and employee training the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase and as technology changes as these threats evolve cybersecurity and data incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors we have processes designed to require third party it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance

by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access correct and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations eg fines of up to 4 of worldwide revenue under the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and to 7500 per intentional violation under the california consumer privacy act ccpa in the us several states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the gdpr and ccpa 

in addition in the us legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws for example we are subject to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity regulation for financial services companies and ccpa india has also proposed sweeping new data protection laws in some cases including data localization laws that may require that personal data stay within their borders 

complying with enhanced obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws is resulting in significant costs of developing implementing or securing our servers and is requiring us to allocate more resources to new privacy compliance processes and to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable 

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the securities and exchange commission sec the department of justice the irs the office of foreign assets control and the federal trade commission in the us the financial conduct authority in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour

standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients underwriting enterprises and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting 

legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges see “the exit of the uk from the european union brexit could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” 

changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business 

for example the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients underwriting enterprises or other business partners 

in addition we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employer sponsored healthcare depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns certain presidential candidates and key members of congress have expressed a desire to establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance including “medicareforall”

and related proposals if we are unable to adapt our services to future changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employer sponsored healthcare our ability to grow our business or provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored healthcare in response to any future law or regulation our results of operations could be adversely impacted

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws sanctioned parties restrictions and fatca 

in foreign countries where we operate a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance however we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

we remain subject to the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm 

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the us the european union and other jurisdictions in which we operate in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties recent regulatory developments related to fatca could also cause shortterm increases in our costs related to systems and process updates needed for us to be able to take advantage of such changes in addition the impact of brexit on fatca reporting for eu placements may further increase our compliance burden and cost of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the tax cuts and jobs act may have an adverse effect on us and such effect may be material 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which significantly revised the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries some aspects of the tax act are still unclear and will continue to be clarified over time while we have updated estimates of the tax impacts based on guidance released to date or interpretations under such guidance other guidance could be issued in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are or have been subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents

improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory pension and claims handling services there is the risk that our employees or subagents

may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decisionmaking services to clients if these clients experience investment losses our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business we have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant

as more fully described in note 17 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete

or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the irs and clients of that business brought a lawsuit against us alleging that the tax benefits associated with their microcaptives were disallowed by the irs in addition we are defending a lawsuit along with chemmod

llc and other defendants asserting infringement of patents held by midwest energy emissions corp and mes inc we cannot reasonably predict the outcomes of these or other matters that we may become involved with in the future an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to the impact of the adoption of and accounting under topic 606 we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes revenue recognition deferred costs stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements further as additional guidance relating to the tax act is released our estimates related to the tax act may change additionally changes in accounting standards such as the changed revenue recognition and lease standards  see note 2 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

our ability to generate returns claim tax deductions and avoid writeoffs in connection with our irc section 45 and irc section 29 investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties including those set forth below 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we began generating tax credits under irc section 45 in 2009 as of december 31 2019 we had generated a total of 1364 million 1364 billion in irc section 45 tax credits of which approximately 4270 million have been used to offset us federal tax liabilities and 9370 million remain unused and available to offset future us federal tax liabilities our ability to use tax credits under irc section 45 depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in irc section 45 these include among others the “placedinservice”

condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal while we have received some degree of confirmation from the irs relating to our ability to claim these tax credits the irs could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied or have not continued to satisfy the conditions set forth in irc section 45 similarly the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our prior synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 at december 31 2019 we had exposure with respect to 1080 million of previously earned tax credits under irc section 29 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related

limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them in addition the irs audited certain of the irc section 29 facilities without requiring any changes

while none of our prior irc section 29 operations are currently under audit many of the irc section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the irs the irs could place the remaining irc section 45 operations and any of the prior irc section 29 operations under audit an adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in irc section 29 tax credits 

the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts

from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals there are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability failure of the chemmod

™

solution utilized at coalfired generation facilities for example could result in violations of air emissions permits which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability additionally some environmental laws without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chemmod

™

solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod

™

solution increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation for example claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance in addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod

™

solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators or other end users will result in that facility owner or operator or other end user accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators or other end users will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and this could result in environmental or product liability claims it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to

also include claims for personal injury property damage nuisance diminution of property value or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim and defense of such claims can be costly even when such defense prevails if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2019 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 46 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time our debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates a small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate in both cases currently based on libor which is expected to transition soon to the secured overnight financing rate which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to stockholders acquisitions capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock 

further we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the us in the event we are unable to meet these us based cash requirements 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient

manner

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected 

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units performance stock units options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest our stockholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 

the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors including the risk factors described above many of which are outside our control in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock among the factors that could affect our stock price are

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap

measures and other” beginning on page 32 for a reconciliation of the nongaap

measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and consulting services and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients and we do not assume net underwriting risks we are headquartered in rolling meadows illinois have operations in 49 countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in 2019 we expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth we generate approximately 69 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 31 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk based on 2019 revenues we expect that our international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues in 2020 will be comparable to 2019 we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 68 14 and 18 respectively to 2019 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds clean energy investments and interest income from premium financing

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty underwriting enterprises have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas as markets 

harden buyers of insurance such as our brokerage clients have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate including by raising their deductibles andor reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives

risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these alternative markets now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures

we typically cite the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab insurance pricing quarterly survey at this time as an indicator of the current insurance rate environment the fourth quarter 2019 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report the first three 2019 quarterly surveys indicated that us commercial propertycasualty rates increased by 35 52 and 62 on average for the first second and third quarters of 2019 respectively we expect a similar trend to be noted when the ciab fourth quarter 2019 survey report is issued which would signal continued price firming the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

in 2020 we expect increases in propertycasualty rates and exposures greater than the modest increases observed during 2019 within our employee benefits and consulting brokerage operations we believe that employment growth a tightening labor market and the complexity surrounding the healthcare regulatory environment bode well for the continued demand of our solutions in addition our history of strong new business generation solid retentions and enhanced valueadded services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world internationally pricing is increasing the most in our london specialty and canadian retail propertycasualty markets and is positive in our australian new zealand and uk retail propertycasualty markets overall we believe that in a positive rate environment with growing exposure units our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and highquality valueadded capabilities by strengthening our clients’ insurance portfolios based on our experience insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions in lines and accounts where rate increases or decreases are warranted the underwriters are pricing accordingly in summary there is adequate capacity in the insurance market and most businesses continue to stay in standardline markets clients can broadly still obtain coverage but at reduced levels in some lines of business 

clean energy investments

 we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod

we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants received tax credits through 2019 and the 20 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 all twenty of the 2011 era plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities

we also own a 465 controlling interest in chemmod

which has been marketing the chemmod

™

solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod

could generate for us approximately 50 million to 60 million of net after tax earnings per quarter

our current estimate of the 2020 annual net after tax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2020 is 800 million to 1000 million 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition

 see revenue recognition in notes 1 2 and 4 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results

income taxes

 see income taxes in notes 1 and 19 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 19 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in fourth quarter 2017 new tax legislation was enacted in the us which lowered the us corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 accordingly we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2017 to reflect this rate change 

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning

strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable see note 19 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements related to changes in our valuation allowances

intangible assetsearnout obligations

 see intangible assets in note 1 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two

to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements which is a level 3 fair value measurement in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2019 business combinations 

business combinations and dispositions 

see note 3 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2019 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2018 and 2017 

on january 8 2019 we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014 in first quarter 2019 we recognized a onetime

information regarding nongaap

measures and other 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac margin before acquisitions diluted net earnings per share as adjusted adjusted eps adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition because they provide investors with measures that our chief operating decision maker uses when reviewing the company’s performance and for the other reasons described below our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap

information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap

information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided we make determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer incentive compensation performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted ebitdac

adjusted nongaap presentation

 we believe that the adjusted nongaap

presentation of our 2019 2018 and 2017 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax

amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

nongaap

earnings measures 

we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segment each as defined below provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance adjusted eps is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity we also consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as ways to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis in addition adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability 

  

 

  

 

  

 

organic revenues a nongaap measure

  for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations in each year presented these revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or are due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable but nongaap

measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2020 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this nongaap

measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 68 of our revenue in 2019 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our brokerage segment generates revenues by 

  

 

  

 

  

  

the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans commissions depend upon a large number of factors including the type of risk being placed the particular underwriting enterprise’s demand the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract rather than being tied to the amount of premiums fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide our services in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenues supplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria contingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

litigation regulatory and taxation matters 

irs investigation

 a portion of our brokerage business includes the development and management of “microcaptives” through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of tribeca strategic advisors which we refer to as tribeca a “captive” is an underwriting enterprise that insures the risks of its owner affiliates or a group of companies microcaptives are captive underwriting enterprises that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under irc section 831b our microcaptive advisory services are under investigation by the internal revenue service which we refer to as irs additionally the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year and subsequent tax years of over 100 of the microcaptive underwriting enterprises organized andor managed by us among other matters the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations while the irs has not made specific allegations relating to our operations or the preacquisition 

activities of tribeca an adverse determination could subject us to penalties and negatively affect our defense of the class action lawsuit described below we may also experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended irs investigation from 2017 to 2019 our microcaptive operations contributed less than 29 million of net earnings and less than 45 million of ebitdac to our consolidated results in any one year due to the fact that the irs has not made any allegation against us or completed all of its audits of our clients we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation

class action lawsuit 

on december 7 2018 a class action lawsuit was filed against us our subsidiary artex risk solutions inc which we refer to as artex and other defendants including tribeca in the unites states district court for the district of arizona the named plaintiffs are microcaptive clients of artex or tribeca and their related entities and owners who had irc section 831b tax benefits disallowed by the irs the complaint attempts to state various causes of action and alleges that the defendants defrauded the plaintiffs by marketing and managing microcaptives with the knowledge that the captives did not constitute bona fide

insurance and thus would not qualify for tax benefits the named plaintiffs are seeking to certify a class of all persons who were assessed back taxes penalties or interest by the irs as a result of their ownership of or involvement in an irs section 831b microcaptive formed or managed by artex or tribeca during the time period january 1 2005 to the present the complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought by the named plaintiffs or the putative class on august 5 2019 the trial court granted the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and dismissed the class action lawsuit plaintiffs are appealing this ruling to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit we will continue to defend against the lawsuit vigorously litigation is inherently uncertain however and it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter and the financial impact to us nor are we able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this lawsuit

financial information relating to our brokerage segment results for 2019 2018 and 2017 in millions except per share percentages and workforce data 

  

the following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac for 2019 2018 and 2017 in millions 

  

commissions and fees

 the aggregate increase in base commissions and fees for 2019 was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2019 and 2018 3828 million and organic revenue growth commissions and fees in 2019 included new business production and renewal rate increases of 4866 million which was offset by lost business of 3538 million the aggregate increase in base commissions and fees for 2018 was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2018 and 2017 2004 million and organic revenue growth commissions and fees in 2018 included new business production and renewal rate increases of 4566 million which was offset by lost business of 2739 million the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2017 was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2017 and 2016 1696 million and organic revenue growth commissions and fees in 2017 included new business production of 3789 million which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of 2643 million commission revenues increased 14 and fee revenues increased 12 in 2019 compared to 2018 respectively the organic change in base commission and fee revenues was 6 in 2019 and 5 in 2018

items excluded from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for 2019 and 2018 include the following in millions 

  

  

for 2019 2018 and 2017 we issued 1908000 881000 and 1041000 shares respectively in connection with taxfree

exchange acquisitions and for 2018 and 2017 repurchased 175000 and 273000 shares respectively to partially offset the impact of the issued shares 

supplemental and contingent revenues 

reported supplemental and contingent revenues recognized in 2019 2018 and 2017 by quarter are as follows in millions

  

 

 

investment income

and net gains on divestitures

net gain of 017 of diluted net earnings per share related to the divestiture of a travel insurance brokerage and four other smaller brokerage operations investment income in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in interest income from our us operations due to increases in interest income earned on client held funds investment income in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in interest income from our australia and new zealand premium financing business which relates to an increase in the volume of premium financing business written in 2018 and increases in interest income earned on client held funds in the us due to an increase in interest rates

compensation expense

 the following provides nongaap

information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2019 and 2018 compensation expense and 2018 and 2017 compensation expense in millions

  

 

 

the increase in compensation expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime

compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 2437 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense  342 million acquisition integration expense  99 million severance related costs  29 million stock compensation expense  29 million deferred compensation  22 million acquisition related costs  26 million temporary staffing  20 million partially offset by a decrease in earnout related compensation charges  16 million the increase in employee headcount in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2019 and new production hires

the increase in compensation expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime

compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1971 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense  244 million severance related costs  109 million deferred compensation  24 million temporary staffing  12 million partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense  08 million and earnout related compensation charges  04 million the increase in employee headcount in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2018 and new production hires the increase in severance related costs is due to the elimination or restructuring of approximately 325 positions that took place during 2018

operating expense

 the following provides nongaap

information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2019 and 2018 operating expense and 2018 and 2017 operating expense in millions

  

 

 

the increase in operating expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation  15 million and increases in meeting and client entertainment expenses  229 million technology expenses  171 million business insurance  138 million costs related to divestitures  130 million outside consulting fees  118 million real estate expenses  108 million marketing expense  82 million acquisition integration  71 million professional and banking fees  56 million lease termination charges  32 million employee related expense  27 million office supplies  26 million outside services expense  20 million other expense  09 million change in deferred operating expense  20 million and bad debt expense  03 million partially offset by a decrease in licenses and fees  17 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2019 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2019 

the increase in operating expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to increases in technology expenses  305 million marketing expense  94 million meeting and client entertainment expenses  89 million real estate expenses  43 million office supplies  34 million employee related expense  32 million outside services expense  32 million licenses and fees  26 million professional and banking fees  22 million other expense  19 million business insurance  18 million and premium financing interest expense  05 million partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation  20 million and decreases in bad debt expense  35 million outside consulting fees  34 million lease termination charges  23 million and change in deferred operating expense  22 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2018 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2018 

depreciation

 the increase in depreciation expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems being offset by fixed assets being fully depreciated in 2019 the decrease in depreciation expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems being offset by fixed assets being fully depreciated in 2018 also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2019 was the depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in 2019

amortization

 the increases in amortization in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2018 compared to 2017 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists noncompete 

agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives two to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete

agreements and two to fifteen years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews in 2019 2018 and 2017 we wrote off 01 million 106 million and 62 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables

 the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2019 2018 and 2017 we recognized 262 million 175 million and 197 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2019 2018 and 2017 acquisitions during 2019 2018 and 2017 we recognized 93 million of income 32 million of income and 96 million of expense respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 112 109 and 106 acquisitions respectively

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2016 to 2019 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two

to threeyear

period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income

provision for income taxes

compensation expense for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively was 779 million 895 million and 882 million

the 116 million decrease in 2019 compensation expense compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower clean energy results in 2019 and due to a reallocation of some additional costs to the brokerage and risk management segments in june 2019 we reviewed our allocation of corporate costs to our business segments in conjunction with that review we made changes to how we allocate certain costs to our business segments reflecting management’s updated view of the costs necessary to support these segments

benefit for income taxes

 we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our twenty 2011 era plants our consolidated effective tax rate was 143 410 and 437 for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the tax rates for 2019 2018 and 2017 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year there were 1960 million 2529 million and 2297 million of section 45 tax credits generated and recognized in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively also impacting the benefit for the income taxes line is the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement in 2017 whereby it requires that the income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled rather than recognizing the tax benefits in excess of compensation costs through stockholders’ equity the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was 174 million 150 million and 151 million respectively

us federal income tax law changes

 on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax act which significantly revises the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries see discussion of the various impacts of the tax act below

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act which we refer to as sab 118 describes three scenarios associated with a company’s status of accounting for income tax reform under the sab 118 guidance we made reasonable estimates for certain effects of tax reform in our 2017 consolidated financial statements we recognized provisional amounts for our deferred income taxes and repatriation tax based on reasonable estimates as of the date of this annual report on form 10k

we have completed our analysis and finalized our estimates under sab 118 finalization of the previous estimates under sab 118 have been recorded as discrete items in 2018

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our assessment of the impact of the tax act 

tax act items impacting the company going forward 

alternative minimum tax credit

 the tax act repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax which we refer to as amt for years beginning january 1 2018 and provides that existing amt credit carryovers will be utilized or refunded beginning in 2018 and ending in 2021 according to a specific formula we have amt credit carryovers that are currently reflected as deferred tax assets in the december 31 2019 consolidated balance sheet which we expect to be fully utilized or refunded to us by tax year 2021

global intangible low taxed income 

the tax act requires us shareholders to include in income certain “global intangible lowtaxed

income” which we refer to as gilti beginning in 2018 we have adopted a policy to include the gilti income in the future period when the tax arises and we recorded income tax expense on such income for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

base erosion antiabuse tax

 the tax act introduced the us base erosion and antiabuse tax which we refer to as beat effective january 1 2018 we have finalized our analysis and determined that our base erosion payments do not exceed the threshold for applicability for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 and we do not currently anticipate any significant longterm impact from the beat on our effective income tax rate in future periods

interest expense limitation

 under the tax act the deductibility of “net interest” for a business is limited to 30 of adjusted taxable income interest that is disallowed can be carried forward indefinitely we have evaluated the impact and determined there is no limit on our interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

executive compensation

 the tax act contains provisions that may limit deductions for executive compensation we determined that our ability to deduct executive compensation will be limited as a result of the tax act

entertainment expenses

 the tax act contains provisions that may further limit deductions for entertainment expenses we determined that our ability to deduct entertainment expenses will be further limited as a result of the tax act

corporate legal entity restructuring  

consists of the tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances that resulted from moving a legal entity within our subsidiary structure

clean energy investments



we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod

llc we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the 14 2009 era plants received tax credits through 2019 and the 20 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2019 in millions 

  

 

the estimated earnings information in the table reflects management’s current best estimate of the 2020 low and high ranges of aftertax

earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities other operating assumptions including current us federal income tax laws however coalfired power plants may not ultimately produce refined fuel at estimated levels due to seasonal electricity demand production costs natural gas prices weather conditions as well as many other operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates

our investment in chemmod

llc generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates

we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to coinvestors

and relinquish control of the plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling minority investor the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control as of any future date we become a noncontrolling minority investor we would deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting

we currently have no construction commitments related to our refined coal plants 

we are aware that some of the coalfired power plants that purchase the refined coal are considering changing to burning natural gas rather than coal or shutting down completely for economic reasons the entities that own such plants are prepared to move the refined coal plants to another coalfired power plant if necessary if these potential developments were to occur we estimate those refined coal plants will not operate for 12 to 18 months during their movement and redeployment this would result in only the 2011 era plants being able to be moved and deployed in the future and the new coalfired power plant may be a higher or lower volume plant all of which could have a material impact on the amount of tax credits that are generated by these plants 

there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

  

 

  

 

see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 14 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2019 2018 and 2017 we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and issuances of our common stock 

cash provided by operating activities was 11192 million 7651 million and 8542 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to the following items decreases in 2019 compared to 2018 of 480 million of payments on acquisition earnouts in excess of original estimates 459 million of income tax payments and 300 million discretionary contribution made to our defined benefit plan in 2018 also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 were timing differences between years in the collection of receivables and direct bill revenues and the payment of accrued liabilities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to the following items 300 million discretionary contribution made to our defined benefit plan in 2018 and increases in 2018 compared to 2017 of 143 million of severance related payments 94 million of prepaid marketing costs and 67 million of payments on acquisition earnouts in excess of original estimates also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 were timing differences between years in the collection of receivables related to accrued supplemental contingent and direct bill revenues and income taxes 

in addition cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was unfavorably impacted by timing differences in the receipt and disbursements of client fiduciary balances in 2019 compared to 2018 the following table summarizes two lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2019 2018 and 2017 in millions 

  

 

our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for our noncash 

expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash

compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted if the amount of irc section 45 tax credits generated which is the amount we recognize for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount of tax credits actually used to reduce our tax cash obligations excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities please see “clean energy investments” below for more information on their potential future impact on cash provided by operating activities

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash

items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 12956 million 10464 million and 9006 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 6688 million 6335 million and 4813 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are

interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2019 2018 and 2017 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2018 we made a 300 million discretionary contribution to the plan in order to minimize the potential impact of having to make required minimum contributions to the plan in future periods during 2019 and 2017 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan 

see note 13 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in 2019 the funded status of the plans was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2019 the impact of which was approximately 213 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2019 than anticipated by approximately 238 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2019 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2019 of 25 million in 2018 the funded status of the plans was favorably impacted by the 300 million contribution discussed above and an increase in the discount rate used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2018 which resulted in a decrease of approximately 202 million however the funded status was unfavorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being lower in 2018 than anticipated by approximately 314 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2018 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2018 of 188 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2019 2018 and 2017 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures

 capital expenditures were 1388 million 1244 million and 1292 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively of which 118 million in 2017 related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in addition 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures include amounts incurred related to investments made in information technology and software development projects relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters we received property tax related credits under a taxincrement

financing note from rolling meadows illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit incentives from these two programs could total between 600 million and 900 million over a fifteenyear period the net capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2017 in 2020 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 1460 million part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment

acquisitions

 cash paid for acquisitions net of cash and restricted cash acquired was 12668 million 7848 million and 3761 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of acquisitions in 2019 than occurred in 2018 the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of acquisitions in 2018 than occurred in 2017 and we used less of our common stock to fund acquisitions in 2018 in addition during 2019 2018 and 2017 we issued 19 million shares 1661 million 08 million shares 608 million and 10 million shares 596 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 49 48 and 39 acquisitions in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2019 2018 and 2017 totaled approximately 4682 million 3398 million and 1723 million respectively in 2020 we expect to use new debt our credit agreement cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete

dispositions

 during 2019 2018 and 2017 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime

gains of 753 million 102 million and 34 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 810 million 145 million and 32 million respectively related to these transactions

on january 8 2019 we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014 in first quarter 2019 we recognized a onetime

net gain of 017 of diluted net earnings per share as a result of the sale

clean energy investments

 during the period from 2009 through 2019 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate of the 2020 annual net aftertax

earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2020 is 800 million to 1000 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants by any capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2020 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time nonetheless if current ownership interests remain the same if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remain as currently anticipated and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2020 through at least 2025 while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see “clean energy investments” on pages 48 to 50 for a more detailed description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties

dividends

 our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets

in 2019 we declared 3239 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 172 per common share on december 20 2019 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 043 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 6 2019 on january 29 2020 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2020 of 045 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 045 per common share throughout 2020 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2020 of approximately 3384 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2019 or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately 173 million compared to 2019 we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments

with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any shares under this registration statement on november 15 2016 we also filed a shelf registration statement on form s4

with the sec registering 100 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses assets or securities at december 31 2019 73 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement

 we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors during the year ended december 31 2019 we did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the year ended december 31 2018 we repurchased 01 million shares of our common stock at cost of 113 million during the year ended december 31 2017 we repurchased 03 million shares of our common stock at cost of 177 million under the provisions of the repurchase plan we are authorized to repurchase approximately 73 million additional shares at december 31 2019 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources

common stock issuances

 another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 1012 million in 2019 819 million in 2018 and 604 million in 2017 on may 16 2017 our stockholders approved the 2017 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2014 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee

directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified

and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 132 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip – 28 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of december 31 2019 were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2019 our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future

outlook

 we believe that we have sufficient capital and access to additional capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 8 14 and 17 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2019 are as follows in millions 

  

 

 

 

the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2019 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 115 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 19 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

see note 8 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements 

offbalance

sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments

 our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2019 are as follows in millions

  

 

 

 

since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 17 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance

sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all but one of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 556 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2016 to 2019 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two

to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 9829 million of which 5650 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made

offbalance sheet debt

 our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2019 and 2018 that was recourse to us

at december 31 2019 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 94 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 165 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive

facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2019 we had posted seven letters of credit totaling 63 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements plus additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity one letter of credit totaling 09 million for collateral related to claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity by a recent acquisition and one letter of credit totaling 05 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisition’s lease these letters of credit have never been drawn upon




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2019 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear

period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2019 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage 

point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2019

as of december 31 2019 we had 39230 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2019 was 42542 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm 

debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purposes of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet based on a hypothetical onepercentage

point change in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2019 a onepercentage

point decrease would result in an estimated fair value of 45323 million or 6093 million more than their current carrying value a onepercentage

point increase would result in an estimated fair value of 39996 million or 766 million more than their current carrying value

as of december 31 2019 we had 5200 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement and 1706 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage

point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2019 because these are shortterm borrowings with variable interest rates the estimated fair values of these borrowings approximate their carrying value

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars please see item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding potential foreign exchange rate risks arising from brexit in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean and latin american operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2019 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 147 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2019 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 148 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus

based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss

historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india norway and the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2019 2018 and 2017 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues through various future payment dates in addition during 2019 2018 and 2017 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and indian currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged all of these hedges are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 815 “derivatives and hedging” and periodically are tested for effectiveness in accordance with such guidance in the scenario where such hedge does not pass the effectiveness test the hedge will be remeasured

at the stated point and the appropriate loss if applicable would be recognized for the year ended december 31 2019 there has been no such effect on our consolidated financial presentation the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2019 2018 and 2017 see note 21 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2019 2018 and 2017

since our founding in 1927 we have grown from a oneperson insurance agency to the world’s fourth largest insurance brokerrisk manager based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s july 2018 edition and one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators according to business insurance magazine’s may 2018 edition we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 61 14 and 25 respectively to 2018 revenues we generate approximately 70 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the united states us with the remaining 30 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the united kingdom uk all of the revenues of the corporate segment are generated in the us

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from our brokerage operations and fees including performancebased fees from our risk management operations the corporate segment generates revenues from our clean energy investments 

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commissions fees supplemental revenues and contingent revenues and our costs to obtain and fulfill the service obligations to our clients can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of contracteffective dates on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of tax credits generated by our clean energy investments also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 20 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2018 and 2017 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 61 of our revenues in 2018 we operate our brokerage segment operations through a network of more than 590 sales and service offices located throughout the us and another 277 sales and service offices in 35 countries but most of which are in australia canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel we also offer client service capabilities in more than 150 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 

  

our brokerage segment generates revenues by 

 

  

  

  

 the vast majority of our brokerage contracts and service understandings are for a period of one year or less 

commissions and fees 

the primary source of brokerage segment revenues is commissions from underwriting enterprises which are based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions 

commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premium for insurance coverage or employee head count for employer sponsored benefit plans commissions depend upon a large number of factors including the type of risk being placed the particular underwriting enterprise’s demand the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract rather than being tied to the amount of premiums fees are typically based on an expected level of effort to provide our services 

whether we are paid a commission or a fee the vast majority of our services are associated with the placement of an insurance or insurancelike contract see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results 

supplemental revenues 

certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues based on the volume of premium we place with them and for insights into our sales pipeline our sales capabilities or our risk selection knowledge these amounts are in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above and not all business we place with underwriting enterprises is eligible for supplemental revenues see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results 

contingent revenues 

certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues for our sales capabilities our risk selection knowledge or our administrative efficiencies these amounts are in excess of the commission revenues discussed above and not all business we place with participating underwriting enterprises is eligible for contingent revenues unlike supplemental revenues also discussed above these revenues are variable generally based on growth the loss experience of the underlying insurance contracts andor our efficiency in processing the business see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results 

subbrokerage costs 

subbrokerage costs are excluded from our gross revenues in our determination of our total revenues subbrokerage costs represent commissions paid to subbrokers related to the placement of certain business by our brokerage segment operations we recognize this contra revenue in the same manner as the commission revenue to which it relates 

  

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 84 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2018 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows 

 

 our retail brokerage operations are organized and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 73 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups we serve are as follows 

 

 our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

 

  

  

  

 wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 16 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2018 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance these brokers operate through more than 295 offices primarily located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for underwriting enterprises managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an underwriting enterprise to manage all or a part of its business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the underwriting enterprise may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

more than 79 of our wholesale brokerage revenues comes from nonaffiliated brokerage clients based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as one of the largest domestic managing general agentsunderwriting managerswholesale brokerslloyds coverholders according to business insurance magazine’s september 2018 edition 

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

  

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 14 of our revenues in 2018 approximately 64 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers’ compensationrelated claims 27 are from general and commercial auto liabilityrelated claims and 9 are from propertyrelated claims in 2018 

risk management services are primarily marketed directly to fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies not for profit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations we manage our third party claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 95 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients 

while this segment complements our brokerage and consulting offerings more than 90 of our risk management segment’s revenues come from clients not affiliated with our brokerage operations such as underwriting enterprises and clients of other insurance brokers based on revenues our risk management operation ranked as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators according to business insurance magazine’s may 2018 edition 

revenues for our risk management segment are comprised of fees generally negotiated i on a perclaim basis ii on a costplus basis or iii as performancebased fees we also provide risk management consulting services that are recognized as the services are delivered 

perclaim fees 

where we operate under a contract with our fee established on a perclaim basis our obligation is to process claims for a term specified within the contract because it is impractical to recognize our revenues on an individual claimbyclaim basis we recognize revenue plus an appropriate estimate of our profit margin on a portfolio basis by grouping claims with similar characteristics a practical expedient as defined in asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which we refer to as topic 606 we apply actuariallydetermined historicalbased patterns to determine our future service obligations without applying a present value discount 

costplus fees 

where we provide services and generate revenues on a costplus basis we recognize revenue over the contract period consistent with the performance of our obligations 

performancebased fees 

certain clients pay us additional fee revenues for our efficiency in managing claims or on the basis of claim outcome effectiveness these amounts are in excess of the fee revenues discussed above these revenues are variable generally based on various performance metrics of the underlying contracts we generally operate under multiyear contracts with fiscal year measurement periods we do not receive these fees if earned until the following year after verification of the performance metrics outlined in the contracts each period we base our estimates on a contractbycontract basis we make our best estimate of amounts we have earned using historical averages and other factors to project such revenues variable consideration is recognized when we conclude that is it probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods 

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from 

 

  

  

  

 corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 25 of our revenues in 2018 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses other corporate costs and the impact of foreign currency translation the revenues reported by this segment result almost solely from our consolidated clean energy investments 

cleanenergy investments 

we own 34 commercial clean coal production facilities that produce refined coal using chemmod llc’s proprietary technologies these operations produce refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under internal revenue code which we refer to as irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits will expire in december 2019 for 14 of our plants and in december 2021 for the other 20 plants chemmod llc described below is a privatelyheld enterprise that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we own 465 of chemmod llc and are its controlling managing member we also have a 120 noncontrolling interest in dormant privatelyheld enterprises cquest technology llc and cquest technologies international llc which we refer to as together cquest which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels at this time it is unclear if cquest will ever become commercially viable 

  

international and other brokerage related operations 

we operate as a retail commercial property and casualty broker throughout more than 43 locations in australia 41 locations in canada and 36 locations in new zealand in the uk we operate as a retail broker from approximately 105 locations we also have specialty wholesale underwriting and reinsurance intermediary operations in london for clients to access lloyd’s of london and other international underwriting enterprises and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities 

in bermuda we act principally as a wholesale broker for clients looking to access bermudabased underwriting enterprises and we also provide management and administrative services for captive insurance entities 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of independent brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through this global network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants we are able to serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in more than 150 countries around the world 

captive underwriting enterprises  we have ownership interests in several underwriting enterprises based in the us bermuda gibraltar guernsey isle of man and malta that primarily operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these “rentacaptive” facilities enable our clients to receive the benefits of participating in a captive underwriting enterprise without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive underwriting enterprises or “rentacaptive” facilities are created for clients to insure their risks and capture any underwriting profit and investment income which would then be available for use by the insureds generally to reduce future costs of their insurance programs in general these companies are set up as protected cell companies that are comprised of separate cell business units which we refer to as captive cells and the core regulated company which we refer to as the core company the core company is owned and operated by us and no insurance policies are assumed by the core company all insurance is assumed or written within individual captive cells only the activity of the supporting core company of the rentacaptive facility is recorded in our consolidated financial statements including cash and stockholder’s equity of the legal entity and any expenses incurred to operate the rentacaptive facility most captive cells reinsure individual lines of insurance coverage from external underwriting enterprises in addition some captive cells offer individual lines of insurance coverage from one of our underwriting enterprise subsidiaries the different types of insurance coverage include special property general liability products liability medical professional liability other liability and medical stop loss the policies are generally claimsmade insurance policies are written by an underwriting enterprise and the risk is assumed by each of the captive cells in general we structure these operations to have no underwriting risk on a net written basis in situations where we have assumed underwriting risk on a net written basis we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for the underwriting risk we have assumed from our clients we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to limit our risk 

we also have a wholly owned underwriting enterprise subsidiary based in the us that cedes all of its insurance risk of loss to reinsurers or captives under facultative and quotashare treaty reinsurance agreements while we believe these ceding reinsurance agreements displace all of our risk of loss they do not discharge us of our primary liability to our clients for example in the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies or captives are unable to meet their obligations we would be liable for such defaulted amounts therefore we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers or captives in order to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer credit risk and insolvencies we believe we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral typically requiring pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to offset the risk see note 17 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to the insurance activity of our wholly owned underwriting enterprise subsidiary for 2018 2017 and 2016 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 2018 edition we were the world’s fourth largest insurance broker based on revenues the insurance brokerage and consulting business is highly competitive and there are many organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete globally with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis towers watson public limited company each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc usi holdings corporation and bbt insurance services operate globally or nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our wholesale brokerage and binding operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc burns  wilcox ltd and all risks ltd as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers we also compete with certain underwriting enterprises that offer insurance and risk management products and solutions directly to clients in addition for our employee benefit consulting services we compete with larger firms such as aon plc mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc willis towers watson public limited company midmarket firms such as lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation specialized consulting firms such as pearl meyer and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

  

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise providing the actual service to the client and the overall cost to our clients 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s may 2018 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc and broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company several large underwriting enterprises such as chubb limited travelers companies inc and liberty mutual holding co inc also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position are our ability to deliver better claim outcomes reputation for outstanding service costefficient service and financial strength 

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 507 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2018 most of which were within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local brokerages agencies or employee benefit consulting operations with a middle or small client focus andor significant expertise in one of our nichepractice groups the total purchase price for individual acquisitions has typically ranged from 10 million to 500 million 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

clients 

our client base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single client or on a few clients the loss of any one client would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2018 our largest single client represented approximately 10 and our ten largest clients together represented approximately 30 of our combined brokerage and risk management segment revenues 

employees 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 30400 employees 

we enter into agreements with many of our brokerage salespersons and significant clientfacing employees plus all of our executive officers which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information andor soliciting our clients prospects and employees upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action

 item 1a  risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

an economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

a decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage and consulting services that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors in addition specific industries or sectors of the economy could experience declines in ways that impact our business for example if climate change and environmental risks harm the oil and gas industry clients in our energy niche could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance coverage or consulting services all such reductions whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in particular industries could adversely impact future commission revenues when the underwriting enterprises perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the commission income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any downturn or improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag a downturn or improvement in the economy some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

the exit of the uk from the european union brexit could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations in the uk which contributed approximately 17 of our brokerage segment and approximately 4 of our risk management segment revenues in 2018 expose us to risk in the event of an economic downturn in the uk due to brexit such a downturn could adversely affect our uk operations through a decline in the insurance coverage and consulting services our clients purchase as they face reductions in their headcount payroll properties or the market value of their assets in a socalled “hard” or “nodeal” brexit where the uk leaves the european union without trade or other deals in place with member countries our european client base outside the uk which is minimal would need to be serviced from operations in a country in the european union while we have a plan in place to service these clients from one of our existing offices in sweden such a transition could be a distraction to both clients and our management in addition the uncertainty surrounding brexit has and may continue to result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets and may lead to a sustained weakness in the british pound’s exchange rate against the us dollar any significant weakening of the british pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segments’ net earnings as reported in us dollars 

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risktaking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance if those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations the failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients and the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage overall risktaking capital capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability such failures or coverage withdrawals on the part of underwriting enterprises could occur for any number of reasons including large unexpected payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefit consulting firms and to a lesser extent claim and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth particularly in our brokerage segment and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equitybacked consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically 

  

postacquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology human resources employee attrition or poor organizational culture and fit some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as casanueva perez sap de cv in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client and our ability to help our clients manage their overall insurance costs losing business to competitors offering similar products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to precisely forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premiums as commissions do 

contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period generally in the first or second quarter based on the growth andor profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year on the other hand supplemental revenues are paid up front on an annual or quarterly basis generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability volume or growth thresholds as the case may be or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations in the case of contingent revenues under the new revenue recognition accounting standard that was effective january 1 2018 this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods see note 2 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for more information 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology these may include new applications or insurancerelated services based on artificial intelligence machine learning robotics blockchain or new approaches to data mining we may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants for example through disintermediation or new entrants such as technology companies “insurtech” startup companies and others these new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate we must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs 

in some cases we depend on key thirdparty vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected 

  

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is one of our key assets we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service ability to protect client information trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities such as culture and values our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees investors and regulators negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees could damage our reputation our reputation could also be impacted by negative perceptions or publicity regarding environmental social and governance esg issues or cybersecurity and data privacy concerns any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients employees and investors or harm our relationships with regulators any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent including our senior management team 

we depend upon members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy we could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders including our chief executive officer we could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent throughout our organization competition for talent in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering is particularly intense in addition our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers along with their clients business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition our failure to adequately address any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our substantial operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

in 2018 we generated approximately 30 of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the us the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations outside the us or create difficulties in staffing and managing such operations for example we have substantial operations in india that provide important backoffice services for other parts of our global organization to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the trade policies of the current us presidential administration could develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above or introduce new risks for our international operations if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations 

our third party claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations damage our reputation and impact client relationships 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business such a disruption could be caused by human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest or war our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us 

for example our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services a disruption affecting risxfacs ® or any other infrastructure supporting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations cause reputational harm and damage our client relationships 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

a cybersecurity attack could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities including our secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack in the future any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of clients and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives policies and resources and employee training the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase as these threats evolve cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and intellectual property if our information systems or infrastructure or those of our third party vendors experience a significant disruption or breach such information could be compromised a party that obtains this information may use it to steal funds for ransom to facilitate a fraud or for other illicit purposes such a disruption or breach could also result in unauthorized access to our proprietary information intellectual property and business secrets 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance it is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective this could harm our reputation create legal exposure or subject us to legal liability significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

  

with respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors we have processes designed to require third party it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors for example the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation gdpr in may 2016 that replaced the former eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr became fully effective in may 2018 and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices in addition legislators and regulators in the us have enacted and are proposing new and more robust privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in light of the recent broadbased cyber attacks at a number of companies including but not limited to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 

these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable 

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the securities and exchange commission which we refer to as sec the department of justice which we refer to as doj the irs and the office of foreign assets control which we refer to as ofac in the us the financial conduct authority which we refer to as fca in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients underwriting enterprises and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges see “the exit of the uk from the european union brexit could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” 

  

changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business 

for example the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients underwriting enterprises or other business partners 

in addition we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employer sponsored healthcare depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns if we are unable to adapt our services to future changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employer sponsored healthcare our ability to grow our business or provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored healthcare in response to any future law or regulation our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws sanctioned parties restrictions and fatca 

in foreign countries where we operate a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance however we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

we remain subject to the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm 

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate us trade sanctions administered by ofac the european union and the united nations and trade sanction laws such as the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties recent regulatory developments related to fatca could also cause shortterm increases in our costs related to systems and process updates needed for us to be able to take advantage of such changes in addition the impact of brexit on fatca reporting for eu placements may further increase our compliance burden and cost of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the tax cuts and jobs act may have an adverse effect on us and such effect may be material 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which significantly revised the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries some aspects of the tax act are still unclear and will continue to be clarified over time while we have updated estimates of the tax impacts based on guidance released to date or interpretations under such guidance other guidance could be issued in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory and claims handling services there is the risk that our employees or subagents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decisionmaking services to clients if these clients experience investment losses our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business we have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 16 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the irs and clients of that business brought a lawsuit against us alleging that the tax benefits associated with their microcaptives were disallowed by the irs in addition chemmod llc is defending lawsuits asserting that various entities associated with our clean energy investments are liable for infringement of a patent held by nalco company we cannot reasonably predict the outcomes of these or other matters that we may become involved with in the future an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to the impact of the adoption of and accounting under topic 606 we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes revenue recognition deferred costs stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements further as additional guidance relating to the tax act is released our estimates related to the tax act may change additionally changes in accounting standards such as the new revenue recognition standard and a new standard for leases  see note 2 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

our ability to generate returns and avoid writeoffs in connection with our irc section 45 and irc section 29 investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties including those set forth below 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 we began generating tax credits under irc section 45 in 2009 as of december 31 2018 we had generated a total of 1168 million 1168 billion in irc section 45 tax credits of which approximately 370 million have been used to offset us federal tax liabilities and 798 million remain unused and available to offset future us federal tax liabilities our ability to use tax credits under irc section 45 depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in irc section 45 these include among others the “placedinservice” condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal while we have received some degree of confirmation from the irs relating to our ability to claim these tax credits the irs could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied or have not continued to satisfy the conditions set forth in irc section 45 similarly the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our prior synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 at december 31 2018 we had exposure with respect to 1080 million of previously earned tax credits under irc section 29 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them in addition the irs audited certain of the irc section 29 facilities without requiring any changes 

while none of our prior irc section 29 operations are currently under audit many of the irc section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the irs the irs could place the remaining irc section 45 operations and any of the prior irc section 29 operations under audit an adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in irc section 29 tax credits 

the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals there are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability failure of the chemmod™ solution utilized at coalfired generation facilities for example could result in violations of air emissions permits which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability additionally some environmental laws without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chemmod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution in addition we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators or other end users will result in that facility owner or operator or other end user accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators or other end users will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and this could result in environmental or product liability claims it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage nuisance diminution of property value or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim and defense of such claims can be costly even when such defense prevails if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2018 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 36 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time our debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates a small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate in both cases currently based on libor which will transition soon to the secured overnight financing rate which exposes us to additional risk in an environment of rising interest rates our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to stockholders acquisitions capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments and require us to comply with certain financial covenants the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock 

further we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the us in the event we are unable to meet these us based cash requirements 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient manner 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected 

  

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units performance stock units options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest our stockholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 

the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors including the risk factors described above many of which are outside our control in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 stockholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction

accounting changes  impact of new revenue recognition accounting standard 

as a result of adopting a new revenue recognition accounting statement we restated our consolidated financial statements and related information from amounts previously reported herein for 2017 and 2016 notes 2 and 3 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements included in this report contains information regarding the impact the new revenue recognition accounting standard had on our financial presentation we adopted the new standard as of january 1 2018 using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented the cumulative effect of the adoption was an increase to retained earnings of 1253 million as of january 1 2016 while the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated results of operations on an annual basis there was a material impact on the presentation of our results in certain quarters due to timing changes in the recognition of certain revenue and expenses as a result we did experience a different “seasonality” in our quarterly results after adoption of the new standard with a shift in the timing of revenue recognized from the second third and fourth quarters to the first quarter

 insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty underwriting enterprises have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages can result in increasing 

  

propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas as markets harden buyers of insurance such as our brokerage clients have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate including by raising their deductibles andor reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these alternative markets now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab fourth quarter 2018 survey had not been issued as of the date of this report the first three 2018 quarterly surveys indicated that us commercial propertycasualty rates increased by 17 15 and 16 on average across all lines for the first second and third quarters of 2018 respectively we expect a similar trend to be noted when the ciab fourth quarter 2018 survey report is issued which would signal a relatively stable market the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

in 2019 we expect modest increases in propertycasualty rates and exposures similar to the modest increases observed during 2018 within our employee benefits and consulting brokerage operations we believe that employment growth a tightening labor market and the complexity surrounding the healthcare regulatory environment bode well for the continued demand of our solutions in addition our history of strong new business generation solid retentions and enhanced valueadded services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world internationally in the uk and canadian retail propertycasualty markets pricing is similar to the us pricing is flat in london specialty and we are experiencing an improving market in australia and new zealand overall we believe that in a stable to modestly positive rate environment with growing exposure units our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and highquality valueadded capabilities by strengthening our clients’ insurance portfolios based on our experience insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions in lines and accounts where rate increases or decreases are warranted the underwriters are pricing accordingly as carriers reach their profitability targets in lines rates may start to flatten in those lines in summary in this environment clients can still obtain coverage businesses continue to stay in standardline markets and there is adequate capacity in the insurance market 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the 14 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the 20 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

thirtyone plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities we are not in current active negotiations for longterm production contracts for two of the 2009 era plants for one of the 2011 era plants we are in early stages of negotiations for a longterm production contract 

we also own a 465 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chemmod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 50 million to 60 million of net after tax earnings per quarter 

our current estimate of the 2019 annual net after tax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2019 is 1050 million to 1150 million 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition  see revenue recognition in notes 1 2 and 3 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the impacts a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition had on our financial position and operating results 

income taxes  see income taxes in notes 1 and 18 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 18 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in fourth quarter 2017 new tax legislation was enacted in the us which lowered the us corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 accordingly we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2017 to reflect this rate change 

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable see note 18 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements related to changes in our valuation allowances 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  see intangible assets in note 1 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements 

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements which is a level 3 fair value measurement in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 4 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2018 business combinations 

business combinations and dispositions 

see note 4 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2018 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2018 2017 and 2016 

  

on january 8 2019 we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014 in the first quarter of 2019 we expect to recognize a onetime net gain between 020 and 023 of diluted net earnings per share as a result of the sale 

results of operations 

information regarding nongaap measures and other 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided as disclosed in our most recent proxy statement we make determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer incentive compensation performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted ebitdac 

adjusted nongaap presentation  we believe that the adjusted nongaap presentation of our 2018 2017 and 2016 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 nongaap earnings measures 

 

   

  

 organic revenues a nongaap measure   for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition organic change in base commission and fee revenues supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or are due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2019 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this nongaap measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 61 of our revenue in 2018 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our brokerage segment generates revenues by 

 

  

  

  

   

the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage or employee head count for employer sponsored benefit plans commissions depend upon a large number of factors including the type of risk being placed the particular underwriting enterprise’s demand the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract rather than being tied to the amount of premiums fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide our services in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenues supplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria contingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

litigation regulatory and taxation matters 

irs investigation  a portion of our brokerage business includes the development and management of “microcaptives” through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of tribeca strategic advisors which we refer to as tribeca a “captive” is an underwriting enterprise that insures the risks of its owner affiliates or a group of companies microcaptives are captive underwriting enterprises that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under irc section 831b our microcaptive advisory services are under investigation by the internal revenue service which we refer to as irs additionally the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the microcaptive underwriting enterprises organized andor managed by us among other matters the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations while the irs has not made specific allegations relating to our operations or the preacquisition activities of tribeca an adverse determination could subject us to penalties and negatively affect our defense of the class action lawsuit described below we may also experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended irs investigation from 2016 to 2018 our microcaptive operations contributed less than 32 million of net earnings and less than 50 million of ebitdac to our consolidated results in any one year due to the fact that the irs has not made any allegation against us or completed all of its audits of our clients we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation 

class action lawsuit  on december 7 2018 a class action lawsuit was filed against us our subsidiary artex risk solutions inc which we refer to as artex and other defendants including tribeca the named plaintiffs are microcaptive clients of artex or tribeca and their related entities and owners who had irc section 831b tax benefits disallowed by the irs the complaint attempts to state various causes of action and alleges that the defendants defrauded the plaintiffs by marketing and managing microcaptives with the knowledge that the captives did not constitute bona fide insurance and thus would not qualify for tax benefits the named plaintiffs are seeking to certify a class of all persons who were assessed back taxes penalties or interest by the irs as a result of their ownership of or involvement in an irs section 831b microcaptive formed or managed by artex or tribeca during the time period january 1 2015 to the present the complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought by the named plaintiffs or the putative class the defendants’ response to the complaint is due on march 8 2019 the court has not otherwise set a case schedule we will vigorously defend against the lawsuit litigation is inherently uncertain however and it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter and the financial impact to us 

  

financial information relating to our brokerage segment results for 2018 2017 and 2016 in millions except per share percentages and workforce data

items excluded from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for 2018 and 2017 include the following in millions 

 

  

 for 2018 2017 and 2016 we issued 881000 1041000 shares and 1998000 shares respectively in connection with taxfree exchange acquisitions and repurchased 175000 273000 shares and 2265000 shares respectively to partially offset the impact of the issued shares 

  

supplemental and contingent revenues  reported supplemental and contingent revenues recognized in 2018 2017 and 2016 by quarter are as follows in millions

compensation expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2018 and 2017 compensation expense and 2017 and 2016 compensation expense in millions 

 

 the increase in compensation expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1971 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense  244 million severance related costs  109 million deferred compensation  24 million temporary staffing  12 million partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense  08 million and earnout related compensation charges  04 million the increase in employee headcount in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2018 and new production hires the increase in severance related costs is due to the elimination or restructuring of approximately 325 positions that took place during 2018 

the increase in compensation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1463 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense  158 million deferred compensation  

  

64 million severance related costs  39 million and stock compensation expense  09 million partially offset by decreases in temporary staffing  12 million the increase in employee headcount in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2017 and new production hires 

operating expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2018 and 2017 operating expense and 2017 and 2016 operating expense in millions 

 

 the increase in operating expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to increases in technology expenses  305 million marketing expense  94 million meeting and client entertainment expenses  89 million real estate expenses  43 million office supplies  34 million employee related expense  32 million outside services expense  32 million licenses and fees  23 million professional and banking fees  22 million other expense  19 million business insurance  18 million and premium financing interest expense  05 million partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation  20 million and decreases in bad debt expense  35 million outside consulting fees  34 million lease termination charges  23 million and change in deferred operating expense  22 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2018 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2018 

the increase in operating expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation  72 million increases in lease termination charges  55 million technology expenses  48 million employee expense  43 million meeting and client entertainment expenses  31 million outside consulting fees  28 million bad debt expense  27 million marketing expense  18 million licenses and fees  09 million outside services expense  08 million professional and banking fees  02 million partially offset by decreases in other expense  66 million real estate expenses  52 million business insurance  37 million office supplies  24 million and premium financing interest expense  01 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2017 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2017 

depreciation  the decrease in depreciation expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems being offset by fixed assets being fully depreciated in 2018 the increase in depreciation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to the purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2018 2017 and 2016 were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years 

amortization  the increases in amortization in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives two to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and two to fifteen years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews in 2018 2017 and 2016 we wrote off 106 million 62 million and 18 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2018 2017 and 2016 we recognized 175 million 197 million and 169 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2018 2017 and 2016 acquisitions during 2018 2017 and 2016 we recognized 32 million of income and 96 million and 152 million of expense respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 109 106 and 101 acquisitions respectively 

  

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2015 to 2018 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income

financial information relating to our corporate segment results for 2018 2017 and 2016 in millions except per share and percentages 

 

 revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

 the increases in 2018 2017 and 2016 are due to increased production of clean coal 

  

 the increase in royalty income in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to increased production of refined coal by chemmod llc’s licensees the decrease in royalty income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to reductions in production of refined coal by chemmod llc’s licensees 

expenses related to royalty income of chemmod llc were 41 million 23 million and 24 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively these expenses are included in the operating expenses discussed below 

 

 the losses in 2018 2017 and 2016 were low because the vast majority of our operations are now consolidated 

 

 in 2018 we recorded 09 million of gain from our legacy investments

cost of revenues  cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2018 2017 and 2016 consists of the cost of coal labor equipment maintenance chemicals supplies management fees and depreciation incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above the increases in cost of revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to increased production 

compensation expense  compensation expense for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively was 895 million 882 million and 726 million 

the 13 million increase in 2018 compensation expense compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased staffing and salary increases cleanenergy performance and efforts related to implementation of the new asc 606 accounting standard partially offset by a decrease in the net pension cost related to our legacy us defined pension plan and a decrease in incentive compensation in 2018 compared to 2017 due to efforts on the new headquarters in 2017 

the 156 million increase in 2017 compensation expense compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased staffing salary increases and incentive compensation related to the implementation of a new accounting standard for revenue recognition efforts related to tax reform efforts related to the new headquarters and cleanenergy performance and an increase in benefits expense 

operating expense  operating expense for 2018 includes banking and related fees of 38 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2018 acquisitions of 132 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 224 million corporate related marketing costs of 156 million expenses of 28 million for systems and consulting related to implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting standard rules and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement gain of 22 million

interest expense  the increase in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 was due to the following 

 

 the capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new corporate headquarters building that was completed in early 2017 

depreciation  depreciation expense in 2018 was flat compared to 2017 the increase in depreciation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily relates to the new corporate headquarters that was placed in service in first quarter 2017 and to clean coal plants redeployed in 2017 and 2016

benefit for income taxes  we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our twenty 2011 era plants our consolidated effective tax rate was 410 437 and 290 for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the tax rates for 2018 2017 and 2016 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year there were 2529 million 2297 million and 1944 million of section 45 tax credits generated and recognized in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively also impacting the benefit for the income taxes line is the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement in 2017 whereby it requires that the income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled rather than recognizing the tax benefits in excess of compensation costs through stockholders’ equity the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 was 150 million and 151 million respectively 

us federal income tax law changes  on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which we refer to as the tax act which significantly revises the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries see discussion of the various impacts of the tax act below 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act which we refer to as sab 118 describes three scenarios associated with a company’s status of accounting for income tax reform under the sab 118 guidance we made reasonable estimates for certain effects of tax reform in our 2017 consolidated financial statements we recognized provisional amounts for our deferred income taxes and repatriation tax based on reasonable estimates as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we have completed our analysis and finalized our estimates under sab 118 finalization of the previous estimates under sab 118 have been recorded as discrete items in 2018 

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our assessment of the impact of the tax act 

  

tax act items impacting the company going forward 

alternative minimum tax credit  the tax act repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax which we refer to as amt for years beginning january 1 2018 and provides that existing amt credit carryovers will be utilized or refunded beginning in 2018 and ending in 2021 according to a specific formula we have amt credit carryovers that are currently reflected as deferred tax assets in the december 31 2018 consolidated balance sheet which we expect to be fully utilized or refunded to us by tax year 2021 

global intangible low taxed income  the tax act requires us shareholders to include in income certain “global intangible lowtaxed income” which we refer to as gilti beginning in 2018 we have adopted a policy to include the gilti income in the future period when the tax arises and we recorded income tax expense on such income for the year ended december 31 2018 

base erosion antiabuse tax  the tax act introduced the us base erosion and antiabuse tax which we refer to as beat effective january 1 2018 we have finalized our analysis and determined that our base erosion payments do not exceed the threshold for applicability for the year ended december 31 2018 and we do not currently anticipate any significant longterm impact from the beat on our effective income tax rate in future periods 

interest expense limitation  under the tax act the deductibility of “net interest” for a business is limited to 30 of adjusted taxable income interest that is disallowed can be carried forward indefinitely we have evaluated the impact and determined there is no limit on our interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes for the year ended december 31 2018 

executive compensation  the tax act contains provisions that may limit deductions for executive compensation we determined that our ability to deduct executive compensation will be limited as a result of the tax act 

entertainment expenses  the tax act contains provisions that may further limit deductions for entertainment expenses we determined that our ability to deduct entertainment expenses will be further limited as a result of the tax act 

  

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2018 2017 and 2016 operating results for the corporate segment in millions 

 

  

 interest and banking costs and debt  interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt 

clean energy related  includes the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production plants and chemmod llc 

acquisition costs  consists of professional fees due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions 

corporate  consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and other corporate level activities costs related to biennial companywide award event crossselling and motivational meetings for our production staff and field management expenses related to our new corporate headquarters corporate related marketing costs expenses for systems and consulting related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting and tax reform rules and the impact of foreign currency translation 

  

during the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017 we incurred 59 million and 89 million respectively of pretax costs related to implementing a new accounting standard related to how companies recognize revenue which was effective beginning in january 2018 these charges are included in the table above in the corporate line a new accounting pronouncement asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting was effective january 1 2017 it requires that the income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement in the income tax benefit column above when the awards vest or are settled rather than recognizing the tax benefits in excess of compensation costs through stockholders’ equity the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017 was 150 million and 151 million respectively and is included in the table above in the corporate line the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the year ended december 31 2016 was 65 million and is not included in the income tax benefit column above 

litigation settlement  during the third quarter of 2015 we settled litigation against certain former uk executives and their advisors for a pretax gain of 310 million 223 million net of costs and taxes in third quarter incremental aftertax expenses that arose in connection with this matter were 88 million and 161 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

home office lease terminationmove  during 2017 we relocated our corporate office headquarters to a nearby suburb of chicago move related aftertax charges were 79 million in 2017 these charges are presented in the corporate segment 

impact of us tax reform  consists of the tax expense from a adjusting december 31 2017 initial estimates from the us tax legislation passed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and b the ongoing impact of such legislation  principally the partial taxation of foreign earnings nondeductible executive compensation and entertainment expenses under the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 guidance in our december 31 2017 consolidated financial statements we recognized provisional amounts for deferred income taxes and repatriation tax based on reasonable estimates and interpretations of the new tax legislation the ultimate impact of the new tax legislation did differ from our estimated amounts as of december 31 2017 amounts due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions we made or additional regulatory or accounting guidance that was issued with respect to the new tax legislation in fourth quarter 2018 the irs issued clarifying guidance related to the new tax legislation which resulted in us recognizing a tax benefit of 89 million in the quarter any additional taxes associated with the ongoing impact of the tax legislation had a de minimis impact on our cash taxes paid due to tax credits generated from our clean energy investments 

corporate legal entity restructuring  consists of the tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances that resulted from moving a legal entity within our subsidiary structure 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod llc we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the 14 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the 20 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2018 in millions 

 

   

the estimated earnings information in the table reflects management’s current best estimate of the 2019 low and high ranges of aftertax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities other operating assumptions including current us federal income tax laws however coalfired power plants may not ultimately produce refined fuel at estimated levels due to seasonal electricity demand production costs natural gas prices weather conditions as well as many other operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates 

our investment in chemmod llc generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates 

we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to coinvestors and relinquish control of the plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling minority investor the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control as of any future date we become a noncontrolling minority investor we would deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting 

we currently have no construction commitments related to our refined coal plants 

we are aware that some of the coalfired power plants that purchase the refined coal are considering changing to burning natural gas rather than coal or shutting down completely for economic reasons the entities that own such plants are prepared to move the refined coal plants to another coalfired power plant if necessary if these potential developments were to occur we estimate those refined coal plants will not operate for 12 to 18 months during their movement and redeployment this would result in only the 2011 era plants being able to be moved and deployed in the future and the new coalfired power plant may be a higher or lower volume plant all of which could have a material impact on the amount of tax credits that are generated by these plants 

there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 

  

 see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 14 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2018 2017 and 2016 we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and issuances of our common stock 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 7651 million 8542 million and 6496 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the following items 300 million discretionary contribution made to our defined benefit plan in 2018 and increases in 2018 compared to 2017 of 143 million of severance related payments 94 million of prepaid marketing costs and 67 million of payments on acquisition earnouts in excess of original estimates also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 were timing differences between years in the collection of receivables related to accrued supplemental contingent and direct bill revenues and income taxes the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improved cash flow generated from our core brokerage and risk management operating units 

in addition cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was unfavorably impacted by timing differences in the receipt and disbursements of client fiduciary balances in 2018 compared to 2017 the following table summarizes two lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2018 2017 and 2016 in millions 

 

 in addition cash provided by operating activities for 2016 were unfavorably impacted by acquisition related integration costs during second quarter 2015 we entered into compensationbased retention agreements with certain key employees of our international brokerage operations these retention agreements added aftertax charges of 73 million and 154 million for 2017 and 2016 respectively to our compensation expense 

our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted if the amount of irc section 45 tax credits generated which is the amount we recognize for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount of tax credits actually used to reduce our tax cash obligations excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities please see “clean energy investments” below for more information on their potential future impact on cash provided by operating activities 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 10464 million 9006 million and 8265 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 6335 million 4813 million and 3965 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2018 2017 and 2016 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2018 we made a 300 million discretionary contribution to the plan in order to minimize the potential impact of having to make required minimum contributions to the plan in future periods during 2017 and 2016 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan 

  

see note 13 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in 2018 the funded status of the plans was favorably impacted by the 300 million contribution discussed above and an increase in the discount rate used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2018 which resulted in a decrease of approximately 202 million however the funded status was unfavorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being lower in 2018 than anticipated by approximately 314 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2018 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2018 of 188 million in 2017 the funded status of the plans was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2017 the impact of which was approximately 92 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2017 than anticipated by approximately 107 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2017 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2017 of 15 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2018 2017 and 2016 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 1244 million 1292 million and 2178 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively of which 118 million in 2017 1121 million in 2016 related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in addition 2018 capital expenditures include amounts incurred related to investments made in information technology and software development projects relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters we received property tax related credits under a taxincrement financing note from rolling meadows illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit incentives from these two programs could total between 600 million and 900 million over a fifteenyear period the net capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2017 the net capital expenditures in 2016 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building and the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2016 in 2019 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 1280 million part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash and restricted cash acquired was 7848 million 3761 million and 2434 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of acquisitions in 2018 than occurred in 2017 and we used less of our common stock to fund acquisitions in 2018 the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of acquisitions in 2017 than occurred in 2016 and we used less of our common stock to fund acquisitions in 2017 in addition during 2018 2017 and 2016 we issued 08 million shares 608 million 10 million shares 596 million and 20 million shares 896 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 48 39 and 37 acquisitions in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2018 2017 and 2016 totaled approximately 3398 million 1723 million and 1379 million respectively in 2019 we expect to use new debt our credit agreement cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete 

dispositions  during 2018 2017 and 2016 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 102 million 34 million and 66 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 145 million 32 million and 78 million respectively related to these transactions 

on january 8 2019 we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014 in the first quarter 2019 we expect to recognize a onetime net gain between 020 and 023 of diluted net earnings per share as a result of the sale 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2018 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate of the 2019 annual net aftertax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2019 is 1050 million to 1150 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants by capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2019 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time nonetheless if current ownership interests remain the same if capital expenditures related to 

  

redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remain as currently anticipated and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2019 through at least 2025 while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see “clean energy investments” on pages 50 to 51 for a more detailed description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties 

cash flows from financing activities 

on april 8 2016 we entered into an amendment and restatement to our multicurrency credit agreement dated september 19 2013 which we refer to as the credit agreement with a group of fifteen financial institutions the amendment and restatement among other things extended the expiration date of the credit agreement from september 19 2018 to april 8 2021 and increased the revolving credit commitment from 6000 million to 8000 million of which 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 750 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment under the credit agreement up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 11000 million there were 2650 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2018 due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit 5180 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2018

the notes consist of the following tranches

the note purchase agreements the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2018 

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2018 we declared 3033 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 164 per common share on december 21 2018 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 041 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 7 2018 on january 30 2019 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2019 of 043 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 043 per common share throughout 2019 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2019 of approximately 3163 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2018 or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately 145 million compared to 2018 we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

shelf registration statement  on november 15 2016 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any shares under this registration statement on november 15 2016 we also filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 with the sec registering 100 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses assets or securities at december 31 2018 92 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors during the year ended december 31 2018 we repurchased 01 million shares of our common stock at cost of 113 million during the year ended december 31 2017 we repurchased 03 million shares of our common stock at cost of 177 million during the year ended december 31 2016 we repurchased 23 million shares of our common stock at cost of 1010 million under the provisions of the repurchase plan we are authorized to repurchase approximately 73 million additional shares at december 31 2018 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 819 million in 2018 604 million in 2017 and 456 million in 2016 on may 16 2017 our stockholders approved the 2017 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2014 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 144 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip – 33 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of december 31 2018 were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2018 our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 

  

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital and access to additional capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 8 14 and 16 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2018 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2018 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 107 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 18 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

on december 22 2018 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100 of the equity of stackhouse poland group limited which we refer to as stackhouse poland headquartered in guildford surrey uk for approximately 3500 million of cash consideration the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 

see note 8 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2018 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 16 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all but one of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 507 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2013 to 2018 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon 

  

estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 5581 million of which 2588 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2018 and 2017 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2018 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 102 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 158 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2018 we had posted seven letters of credit totaling 63 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements plus additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity one letter of credit totaling 13 million for collateral related to claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity by a recent acquisition and one letter of credit totaling 05 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisition’s lease these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2018 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2018 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2018 

as of december 31 2018 we had 31980 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2018 was 31944 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purposes of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us based on our current estimated credit rating 

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet based on a hypothetical onepercentage point change in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2018 a onepercentage point decrease would result in an estimated fair value of 33992 million or 2012 million more than their current carrying value a onepercentage point increase would result in an estimated fair value of 30062 million or 1918 million less than their current carrying value 

as of december 31 2018 we had 2650 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement and 1540 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2018 because these are shortterm borrowings with variable interest rates the estimated fair values of these borrowings approximate their carrying value 

  

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars please see item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding potential foreign exchange rate risks arising from brexit in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean and south american operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2018 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 168 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2018 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 195 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss 

historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india norway and the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2018 2017 and 2016 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues through various future payment dates in addition during 2018 2017 and 2016 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and indian currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged all of these hedges are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 815 “derivatives and hedging” and periodically are tested for effectiveness in accordance with such guidance in the scenario where such hedge does not pass the effectiveness test the hedge will be remeasured at the stated point and the appropriate loss if applicable would be recognized for the year ended december 31 2018 there has been no such effect on our consolidated financial presentation the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2018 2017 and 2016 see note 19 to our 2018 consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2018 2017 and 2016

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from our brokerage operations and fees including performancebased fees from our risk management operations the corporate segment generates revenues from our clean energy investments information with respect to all sources of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017 is as follows in millions 

 

 see note 20 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information including earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2017 2016 and 2015 

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commissions fees supplemental revenues and contingent revenues and our costs to obtain and fulfill the service obligations to our clients can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of contracteffective dates and the timing of receipt of information from underwriting enterprises on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of tax credits generated by our clean energy investments also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 19 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2017 and 2016 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 62 of our revenues in 2017 we operate our brokerage segment operations through a network of more than 370 sales and service offices located throughout the us and another 240 sales and service offices in 32 countries but most of which are in australia canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel we also offer client service capabilities in more than 150 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 

our brokerage segment generates revenues by 

 

  

  

   

 the vast majority of our brokerage contracts and service understandings are for a period of one year or less 

commissions and fees 

the primary source of brokerage segment revenues are commissions from underwriting enterprises which are based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients or fees received from clients which are based on an agreed level of service with our clients usually in lieu of commissions 

commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premium for insurance coverage or employee head count for employer sponsored benefit plans commissions depend upon a large number of factors including the type of risk being placed the particular underwriting enterprise’s demand the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract fees are rarely tied to the amount of premiums instead they are based on an expected level of effort to provide our services 

whether we are paid a commission or a fee the vast majority of our services are associated with the placement of an insurance or insurancelike contract see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition could have on our future financial position and operating results 

supplemental revenues 

certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues based on the volume of premium we place with them and for insights into our sales pipeline our sales capabilities or our risk selection knowledge these amounts are in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above and not all business we place with underwriting enterprises is eligible for supplemental revenues see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition could have on our future financial position and operating results 

contingent revenues 

certain underwriting enterprises may pay us additional revenues for our sales capabilities our risk selection knowledge or our administrative efficiencies these amounts are in excess of the commission revenues discussed above and not all business we place with participating underwriting enterprises is eligible for contingent revenues unlike supplemental revenues discussed above these revenues are variable generally based on growth the loss experience of the underlying insurance contracts andor our efficiency in processing the business see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts that a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition could have on our future financial position and operating results 

subbrokerage costs 

subbrokerage costs are excluded from our gross revenues in our determination of our total revenues subbrokerage costs represent commissions paid to subbrokers related to the placement of certain business by our brokerage segment operations we recognize this contra revenue in the same manner as the commission revenue to which it relates 

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 83 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2017 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows 

 

   

our retail brokerage operations are organized and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 73 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups we serve are as follows 

 

 our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

 

  

  

  

 wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 17 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2017 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance these brokers operate through more than 80 offices primarily located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for underwriting enterprises managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an underwriting enterprise to manage all or a part of its business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the underwriting enterprise may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

more than 75 of our wholesale brokerage revenues comes from nonaffiliated brokerage clients based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as one of the largest domestic managing general agentsunderwriting managerswholesale brokerslloyds coverholders according to business insurance magazine’s september 2017 edition 

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 13 of our revenues in 2017 approximately 64 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers’ compensationrelated claims 32 are from general and commercial auto liabilityrelated claims and 4 are from propertyrelated claims 

risk management services are primarily marketed directly to fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies not for profit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations we manage our third party claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 90 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients 

while this segment complements our brokerage and consulting offerings more than 90 of our risk management segment’s revenues come from clients not affiliated with our brokerage operations such as underwriting enterprises and clients of other insurance brokers based on revenues our risk management operation ranked as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators according to business insurance magazine’s june 2017 edition 

revenues for our risk management segment are comprised of fees generally negotiated i on a perclaim basis ii on a costplus basis or iii as performancebased fees we also provide risk management consulting services that are recognized as the services are delivered 

  

perclaim fees 

where we operate under a contract where our fee is established on a perclaim basis our obligation is to process claims for a term specified within the contract which we provide over a period of time we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 

costplus fees 

where we provide services and generate revenues on a costplus basis we recognize revenue over the contract period 

performancebased fees 

certain clients pay us additional fee revenues for our efficiency in managing claims or on the basis of claim outcome effectiveness these amounts are in excess of the fee revenues discussed above these revenues are variable generally based on various performance metrics of the underlying contracts we generally operate under multiyear contracts with fiscal year measurement periods we do not receive these fees if earned until the following year after verification of the performance metrics outlined in the contracts each period we base our estimates on a contractbycontract basis 

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from 

 

  

  

  

 corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 25 of our revenues in 2017 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate costs the revenues reported by this segment in 2017 resulted almost solely from our consolidated clean energy investments 

cleanenergy investments 

we own 34 commercial clean coal production facilities that produce refined coal using chemmod llc’s proprietary technologies these operations produce refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits will expire in december 2019 for 14 of our plants and in december 2021 for the other 20 plants chemmod llc described below is a privatelyheld enterprise that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we own 465 of chemmod llc and are its controlling managing member we also have a 120 noncontrolling interest in a dormant privatelyheld enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels it is unclear if cquest will ever become commercially viable 

international operations 

our total revenues by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017 were as follows in millions 

 

   

total revenues generated by our uk based operations increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to organic revenue growth and favorable foreign currency translation total revenues generated by our australia canada new zealand and other foreign operations increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to organic revenue growth and acquisition related activity see notes 6 17 and 20 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2017 2016 and 2015 

international and other brokerage related operations 

we operate as a retail commercial property and casualty broker throughout more than 39 locations in australia 35 locations in canada and 30 locations in new zealand in the uk we operate as a retail broker from approximately 100 locations we also have specialty wholesale underwriting and reinsurance intermediary operations in london for clients to access lloyd’s of london and other international underwriting enterprises and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities 

in bermuda we act principally as a wholesale broker for clients looking to access bermudabased underwriting enterprises and we also provide management and administrative services for captive insurance entities 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of independent brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through this global network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in more than 150 countries around the world 

captive underwriting enterprises  we have ownership interests in several underwriting enterprises based in the us bermuda gibraltar guernsey isle of man and malta that primarily operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these “rentacaptive” facilities enable our clients to receive the benefits of participating in a captive underwriting enterprise without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive underwriting enterprises or “rentacaptive” facilities are created for clients to insure their risks and capture any underwriting profit and investment income which would then be available for use by the insureds generally to reduce future costs of their insurance programs in general these companies are set up as protected cell companies that are comprised of separate cell business units which we refer to as captive cells and the core regulated company which we refer to as the core company the core company is owned and operated by us and no insurance policies are assumed by the core company all insurance is assumed or written within individual captive cells only the activity of the supporting core company of the rentacaptive facility is recorded in our consolidated financial statements including cash and stockholder’s equity of the legal entity and any expenses incurred to operate the rentacaptive facility most captive cells reinsure individual lines of insurance coverage from external underwriting enterprises in addition some captive cells offer individual lines of insurance coverage from one of our underwriting enterprise subsidiaries the different types of insurance coverage include special property general liability products liability medical professional liability other liability and medical stop loss the policies are generally claimsmade insurance policies are written by an underwriting enterprise and the risk is assumed by each of the captive cells in general we structure these operations to have no underwriting risk on a net written basis in situations where we have assumed underwriting risk on a net written basis we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for the underwriting risk we have assumed from our clients we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to limit our risk 

we also have a wholly owned underwriting enterprise subsidiary based in the us that cedes all of its insurance risk of loss to reinsurers or captives under facultative and quotashare treaty reinsurance agreements while we believe these ceding reinsurance agreements displace all of our risk of loss they do not discharge us of our primary liability to our clients for example in the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies or captives are unable to meet their obligations we would be liable for such defaulted amounts therefore we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers or captives in order to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer credit risk and insolvencies we believe we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for which we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to fully offset the risk see note 16 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to the insurance activity of our wholly owned underwriting enterprise subsidiary for 2017 2016 and 2015 

international risk management operations 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the us and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

see item 1a “risk factors” for information regarding risks attendant to these foreign operations 

  

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 2017 edition we were the world’s fourth largest insurance broker based on revenues the insurance brokerage and consulting business is highly competitive and there are many organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete globally with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis towers watson public limited company each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as jardine lloyd thomson group plc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc usi holdings corporation and bbt insurance services operate globally or nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office in addition for our employee benefit consulting services we compete with larger firms such as aon plc mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc willis towers watson public limited company midmarket firms such as lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation specialized consulting firms such as pearl meyer and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies our wholesale brokerage and binding operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc burns  wilcox ltd and all risks ltd as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers we also compete with certain underwriting enterprises that offer insurance and risk management products and solutions directly to clients government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise providing the actual service to the client and the overall cost to our clients 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s june 2017 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company and esis a subsidiary of chubb limited several large underwriting enterprises such as travelers and liberty mutual also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position are reputation for outstanding service costefficient service and ability to deliver better claimoutcomes 

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 459 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2017 most of which were within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local brokerages agencies or employee benefit consulting operations with a middle or small client focus andor significant expertise in one of our nichepractice groups the total purchase price for individual acquisitions has typically ranged from 10 million to 500 million although in 2014 we completed three large international brokerage acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price consideration in excess of 17 billion 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying 

 

  

  

 see note 3 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a summary of our 2017 acquisitions the amount and form of the consideration paid and the dates of acquisition 

clients 

our client base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single client or on a few clients the loss of any one client would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2017 our largest single client represented approximately 10 and our ten largest clients together represented approximately 30 of our combined brokerage and risk management segment revenues 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 26800 employees 

we enter into agreements with many of our brokerage salespersons and significant clientfacing employees plus all of our executive officers which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information andor soliciting our clients prospects and employees upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

an overall economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

an overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of consulting services and insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the underwriting enterprises perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the commission income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any downturn or improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag a downturn or improvement in the economy some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected our substantial operations outside the us expose us to risk even when economic activity is strong in the us for example our operations in the uk which contributed approximately 18 of our brokerage segment and approximately 4 of our risk management segment revenues in 2017 expose us to risk in the event of an economic downturn in the uk due to brexit 

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risktaking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance if those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations the failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients and the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage overall risktaking capital capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to precisely forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premiums as commissions do 

  

contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period generally in the first or second quarter based on the growth andor profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year on the other hand supplemental revenues are paid up front on an annual or quarterly basis generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability volume or growth thresholds as the case may be or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations in the case of contingent revenues under the new revenue recognition accounting standard which is effective january 1 2018 this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods see note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for more information 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms 

we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render the personalized attention we provide the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client and our ability to help our clients manage their overall insurance costs losing business to competitors offering similar products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technology change the threat may come from established market participants through disintermediation as well as from new entrants we must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs 

in some cases we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is one of our key assets we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service ability to protect client information trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees could damage our reputation any resulting erosion of trust and confidence among existing and potential clients regulators stockholders and other parties important to the success of our business could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefit consulting firms and to a lesser extent claim and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth particularly in our brokerage segment and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equitybacked consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically 

postacquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology human resources or organizational culture and fit some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as casanueva perez sap de cv in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain both new talent and experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers along with their client and business relationships to competitors such departures could lead to the loss of clients and intellectual property the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments or our inability to identify recruit and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our substantial operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

in 2017 we generated approximately 31 of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the us including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations for example we have substantial operations in india to provide certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the foreign and international trade policies of the current us presidential administration could develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above or introduce new risks for our international operations if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our business is located outside the us some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations in the uk brexit has and may continue to result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets and may lead to a sustained weakness in the british pound’s exchange rate against the us dollar any significant weakening of the british pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segment revenues and earnings as reported in us dollars 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations 

our third party claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

  

business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations damage our reputation and impact client relationships 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business such a disruption could be caused by human error capacity constraints hardware failure or defect natural disasters fire power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest or war our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us 

for example our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services a disruption affecting risxfacs ® or any other infrastructure supporting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations cause reputational harm and damage our client relationships 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

a cybersecurity attack could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business in the future any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of clients and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives policies and resources and employee training the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase as these threats evolve cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and intellectual property if our information systems or infrastructure or those of our third party vendors experience a significant disruption or breach such information could be compromised a party that obtains this information may use it to steal funds for ransom to facilitate a fraud or for other illicit purposes such a disruption or breach could also result in unauthorized access to our proprietary information intellectual property and business secrets 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance it is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective this could harm our reputation create legal exposure or subject us to legal liability 

significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors we have processes designed to require third party it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems 

  

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations particularly in europe or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors for example the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation gdpr in may 2016 that will replace the current eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr will become fully effective in may 2018 and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices in addition legislators and regulators in the us are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity rules in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies 

these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable 

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the securities and exchange commission sec the department of justice doj the internal revenue service irs and the office of foreign assets control ofac in the us the financial conduct authority fca in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients underwriting enterprises and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition in light of recent events associated with brexit we will likely face new regulatory costs and challenges for example our uk operations could lose their european union financial services passport which provides them the license to operate across borders within the single european union market without obtaining local regulatory approval 

changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business 

  

for example the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients underwriting enterprises or other business partners 

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws sanctioned parties restrictions and fatca 

in foreign countries where we operate a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance however we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

we remain subject to the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm 

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate us trade sanctions administered by ofac the european union and the united nations and trade sanction laws such as the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 health care reform legislation 

the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies initiatives by the current presidential administration to change certain aspects of this legislation including repeal of the individual mandate and further delay of the “cadillac tax” may increase such complexity many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns in addition if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

  

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory and claims handling services there is the risk that our employees or subagents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decisionmaking services to clients if these clients experience investment losses our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business we have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 15 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the irs in addition we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we our subsidiary gallagher clean energy llc and chemmod llc are liable for infringement of a patent held by nalco company an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act may have an adverse effect on us and such effect may be material 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which significantly revises the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries many aspects of the tax act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time as a result we have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new laws on our business operating results and financial condition it is possible that the tax act or interpretations under it could have an adverse effect on us and such effect could be material 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates further as guidance relating to the recently enacted tax act is released our provisional estimates related to the tax act may change additionally changes in accounting standards such as the new revenue recognition standard and a new standard for leases – see note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

  

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

see note 13 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments our ability to generate returns and avoid writeoffs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties these include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties set forth below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals there are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability failure of the chemmod™ solution utilized at coalfired generation facilities for example could result in violations of air emissions permits which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability additionally some environmental laws without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chemmod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution in addition we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual 

  

arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators or other end users will result in that facility owner or operator or other end user accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators or other end users will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and this could result in environmental or product liability claims it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage nuisance diminution of property value or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim and defense of such claims can be costly even when such defense prevails if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2017 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 30 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time our debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates it will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to stockholders acquisitions capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments and require us to comply with certain financial covenants the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock 

further we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the us in the event we are unable to meet these us based cash requirements 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient manner 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected 

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units performance stock units options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest our stockholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 

the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors including the risk factors described above many of which are outside our control in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 stockholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” beginning on page 35 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures 

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and consulting and third party claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients and we do not assume net underwriting risks we are headquartered in rolling meadows illinois have operations in 32 other countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in 2017 we expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth we generate approximately 69 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 31 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk based on 2017 revenues we expect that our international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues in 2018 will be comparable to 2017 we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 62 13 and 25 respectively to 2017 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds clean energy investments and interest income from premium financing 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

accounting changes  impact of new revenue recognition accounting standard 

note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in this report contains information regarding the potential impact a new revenue recognition accounting standard could have on our future financial presentation we will adopt the new standard as of january 1 2018 using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented we anticipate the cumulative effect of the adoption will be an increase to retained earnings as of january 1 2016 the primary impacts of the new standard to our segments are anticipated to be as follows 

with respect to the brokerage segment we expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations in certain quarters due to timing changes in the recognition of certain revenue and expenses as a result we will report a different seasonality with respect to quarterly results after adoption of the new standard with a shift in the timing of revenue recognized from the second third and fourth quarters to the first quarter while we do not expect yearoveryear revenue and expense comparisons to be materially affected by these changes we do expect annual brokerage segment revenue net earnings and ebitdac to be greater on an absolute basis under the new accounting standard 

with respect to the risk management segment under the new standard we will record the full amount of claim revenue upon notification of the claim and defer certain revenue to reflect delivery of services over the claim handling period we anticipate the net impact of the new standard will require more initial revenue deferral and revenue recognition over a longer period of time than under the old accounting standard we do not expect a material change to annual risk management segment revenue net earnings and ebitdac on an absolute basis under the new accounting standard 

with respect to the corporate segment we expect that the timing related to recognition of revenue will remain substantially unchanged we do not expect a material impact to our annual after tax earnings but we do expect a material change in the emergence of our after tax earnings in the interim quarterly periods as income tax credits are recognized based on our quarterly consolidated pretax earnings patterns

 insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty underwriting enterprises have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas as markets 

  

harden buyers of insurance such as our brokerage clients have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate including by raising their deductibles andor reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these alternative markets now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab fourth quarter 2017 survey had not been issued as of the date of this report the first three 2017 quarterly surveys indicated that us commercial propertycasualty rates decreased by 25 28 and 13 on average across all lines for the first second and third quarters of 2017 respectively we expect a similar trend to be noted when the ciab fourth quarter 2017 survey report is issued which would signal some stability in the market in 2018 we see stable us retail propertycasualty rates and continued growth in propertycasualty exposures we also see us employment growth and uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act as tailwinds for our employee benefit units internationally we see the uk and canadian retail propertycasualty markets similar to us retail more softening in london specialty but an improving market in australia and new zealand overall we believe the global rate environment is flat to improving and exposure units are increasing in certain lines and geographies in addition our history of strong new business generation solid retentions and enhanced valueadded services for our underwriting enterprise partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world based on our experience underwriting enterprises appear to be making rational pricing decisions in lines and accounts where rate increases or decreases are warranted the underwriters are pricing accordingly as underwriting enterprises reach their profitability targets in lines rates may start to flatten in summary in this environment premium levels are stable clients can still obtain coverage businesses continue to stay in standardline markets and there is adequate capacity in the insurance market it is not clear whether the rate retraction will reverse in the current economic environment the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the 14 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the 20 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

31 plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities we are not in current active negotiations for longterm production contracts for two of the 2009 era plants for one of the 2011 era plants we are in early stages of negotiations for a longterm production contract 

we also own a 465 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chemmod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 40 million to 50 million of net after tax earnings per quarter 

our current estimate of the 2018 annual net after tax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2018 is 1050 million to 1150 million 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition  see revenue recognition in note 1 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition could have on our future financial position and operating results 

income taxes  see income taxes in notes 1 and 17 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 17 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in fourth quarter 2017 new tax legislation was enacted in the us which lowered the us corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 accordingly we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2017 to reflect this rate change 

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  see intangible assets in note 1 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements 

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections that are developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2017 business combinations

results of operations 

information regarding nongaap measures and other 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided as disclosed in our most recent proxy statement we do not make determinations regarding executive officer incentive compensation on the basis of “adjusted” measures such as those described below in “adjusted revenues and expenses” or “adjusted ebitdac” instead incentive compensation determinations for executive officers are made on the basis of revenue and ebitdac in 2017 and ebitac prior to 2017 defined as earnings before interest taxes amortization and change in estimated earnout payables for the combined brokerage and risk management segments 

adjusted nongaap presentation  we believe that the adjusted nongaap presentation of our 2017 2016 and 2015 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period

 organic revenues a nongaap measure   for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition change in base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the impact of and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2018 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this nongaap measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 

reconciliation of nongaap information presented to gaap measures  this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted and organic revenue measures 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 62 of our revenue in 2017 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage clients choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive underwriting enterprises our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by underwriting enterprises which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular underwriting enterprise underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenues supplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria contingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

litigation and regulatory matters  a portion of our brokerage business includes the development and management of “microcaptives” through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of tribeca strategic advisors tribeca a “captive” is an underwriting enterprise that insures the risks of its owner affiliates or a group of companies microcaptives are captive underwriting enterprises that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under irc section 831b our microcaptive advisory services are under investigation by the internal revenue service irs additionally the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the microcaptive underwriting enterprises organized andor managed by us among other matters the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations while the irs has not made specific allegations relating to our operations or the preacquisition activities of tribeca if the irs were to successfully assert that the microcaptives organized andor managed by us do not meet the requirements of irc section 

  

831b we could be subject to monetary claims by the irs andor our microcaptive clients and our future earnings from our microcaptive operations could be materially adversely affected any of which event could negatively impact the overall captive business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition we may also experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended irs investigation on our clients’ and potential clients’ businesses annual renewals for microcaptive clients generally occur during the fourth quarter therefore any negative impact from this investigation would likely have a disproportionate impact on fourthquarter results in 2017 2016 and 2015 our microcaptive operations contributed less than 35 million of net earnings and less than 50 million of ebitdac to our consolidated results in any one year due to the fact that the irs has not made any allegation against us or completed all of its audits of our clients we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation

the following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac for 2017 2016 and 2015 in millions 

 

 acquisition integration costs include costs related to our july 2 2014 acquisition of noraxis capital corporation which we refer to as noraxis our june 16 2014 acquisition of the crombieoamps operations which we refer to as crombieoamps our april 1 2014 acquisition of oval group of companies which we refer to as oval our november 14 2013 acquisition of the giles group of companies which we refer to as giles and our august 1 2015 acquisition of william gallagher associates insurance brokers which we refer to wga that we incurred until we fully assimilated these acquisitions into our operations these costs related to onboarding of employees communication system conversion costs related performance compensation redundant workforce extra lease space duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquired businesses with our it related systems the wga integration costs in 2017 totaled 13 million and were primarily related to retention and incentive compensation the crombieoamps integration costs in 2017 totaled 13 million and were primarily related to technology costs and incentive compensation the giles and oval integration costs in 2017 totaled 122 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the uk technology costs branding and incentive compensation the wga integration costs in 2016 totaled 50 million and were primarily related to retention and incentive compensation the noraxis integration costs in 2016 totaled 19 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices technology costs and incentive compensation the crombieoamps integration costs in 2016 totaled 32 million and were primarily related to technology costs and incentive compensation the giles and oval integration costs in 2016 totaled 356 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the uk technology costs branding and incentive compensation the noraxis integration costs in 2015 totaled 74 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices technology costs and incentive compensation the crombieoamps integration costs in 2015 totaled 234 million and were primarily related to technology costs and incentive compensation the giles and oval integration costs in 2015 totaled 690 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the uk technology costs branding and incentive compensation 

commissions and fees  the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2017 was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2016 and 2017 1665 million and organic revenue growth commissions and fees in 2017 included new business production of 3789 million which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of 2643 million the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2016 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2015 and 2016 1732 million commissions and fees in 2016 included new business production of 3597 million which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of 3626 million the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2015 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2014 and 2015 3906 million commissions and fees in 2015 included new business production of 3452 million which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of 2873 million commission revenues increased 8 and fee revenues increased 12 in 2017 compared to 2016 respectively commission revenues increased 4 and fee revenues increased 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 respectively the organic change in base commission and fee revenues was 4 in 2017 3 in 2016 and 3 in 2015 

  

items excluded from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for 2017 2016 and 2015 include the following in millions 

 

   

  

  

 supplemental and contingent revenues  reported supplemental and contingent revenues recognized in 2017 2016 and 2015 by quarter are as follows in millions 

 

   

 investment income and gains realized on books of business sales  this primarily represents interest income earned on cash cash equivalents and restricted funds interest income from premium financing and onetime gains related to sales of books of business which were 34 million 66 million and 67 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively investment income in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in interest income from our premium financing business investment income in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in interest income from our premium financing business and in interest income earned on client held funds both of which were related to a decline in interest rates in australia and new zealand 

compensation expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2017 and 2016 compensation expense and 2016 and 2015 compensation expense in millions 

 

 the increase in compensation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1496 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 158 million deferred compensation 64 million severance related costs 39 million and stock compensation expense 09 million partially offset by decreases in temporary staffing 12 million the increase in employee headcount in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2017 and new production hires 

the increase in compensation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 811 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 157 million stock compensation expense 47 million deferred compensation 35 million and temporary staffing 05 million partially offset by decreases in severance related costs 25 million and earnout related compensation expense 09 million the increase in employee headcount in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2016 and new production hires 

  

operating expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2017 and 2016 operating expense and 2016 and 2015 operating expense in millions 

 

 the increase in operating expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation 46 million increases in lease termination charges 55 million meeting and client entertainment expenses 49 million technology expenses 48 million employee expense 43 million outside consulting fees 28 million bad debt expense 27 million licenses and fees 09 million outside services expense 08 million partially offset by decreases in other expense 67 million real estate expenses 52 million business insurance 37 million office supplies 24 million and premium financing interest expense 01 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2017 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2017 

the decrease in operating expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to favorable foreign currency translation 32 million decreases in business insurance 153 million technology expenses 114 million professional and banking fees 56 million licenses and fees 37 million other expense 34 million bad debt expense 24 million employee expense 10 million premium financing interest expense 07 million real estate expenses 03 million partially offset by increases in meeting and client entertainment expenses 42 million outside consulting fees 29 million office supplies 13 million and lease termination charges 02 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2016 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2016 

depreciation  the increases in depreciation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 were due primarily to the purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2017 2016 and 2015 were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years 

amortization  the increases in amortization in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and five to ten years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews in 2017 2016 and 2015 we wrote off 62 million 18 million and 115 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2017 2016 and 2015 we recognized 197 million 169 million and 162 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2017 2016 and 2015 acquisitions during 2017 2016 and 2015 we recognized 96 million 152 million and 249 million of expense respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 106 101 and 103 acquisitions respectively 

  

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2014 to 2017 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income 

provision for income taxes  we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage segment using local statutory rates the brokerage segment’s effective tax rate in 2017 2016 and 2015 was 344 349 on a controlling basis 352 354 on a controlling basis and 351 respectively in fourth quarter 2017 new tax legislation was enacted in the us which lowered the us corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 the impact of the adjustment of our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2017 to reflect the us rate change on the provision for income taxes in the brokerage segment was immaterial see the us federal income tax law changes and sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 in the corporate segment below for an additional discussion of the impact of the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate on adjusted results of approximately 240 to 260 in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future in 2016 new tax legislation was enacted in the uk which will decrease the uk corporation tax rate from 180 to 170 effective april 1 2020 accordingly we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2016 to reflect these rate changes which decreased the provision for income taxes in the brokerage segment by 15 million or 001 per share in 2015 new tax legislation was enacted in the uk which lowered the uk corporation tax rate from 200 to 190 effective april 1 2017 and from 190 to 180 effective april 1 2020 accordingly we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2015 to reflect these rate changes which decreased the provision for income taxes in the brokerage segment by 42 million or 002 per share 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests  the amounts reported in this line for 2017 2016 and 2015 include noncontrolling interest earnings of 81 million 36 million and 17 million respectively primarily related to our investment in capsicum reinsurance brokers llp which we refer to as capsicum we are partners in this venture with grahame chilton the ceo of our international brokerage division we are the controlling partner participating in 33 of capsicum’s net operating results and mr chilton owns approximately 50 of capsicum

 fees  the increase in fees for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to new business of 695 million and higher international performance bonus fees which were partially offset by lost business of 305 million the decrease in fees for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lost business of 682 million which was offset by new business and the impact of increased claim counts total of 588 million in 2016 organic change in fee revenues was 5 in 2017 1 in 2016 and 11 in 2015 

items excluded from organic fee computations yet impacting revenue comparisons in 2017 2016 and 2015 include the following in millions 

 

  

 investment income  investment income primarily represents interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents investment income in 2017 decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to lower levels of invested assets in 2017 investment income in 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to higher levels of invested assets in 2016 

  

compensation expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2017 and 2016 compensation expense and 2016 and 2015 compensation expense in millions 

 

 the increase in compensation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased headcount and increases in salaries 172 million in the aggregate unfavorable foreign currency translation 11 million temporarystaffing expense 21 million deferred compensation 13 million employee benefits 10 million and stock compensation expense 07 million partially offset by a decrease in severance related costs 10 million

operating expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2017 and 2016 operating expense and 2016 and 2015 operating expense in millions 

 

 the increase in operating expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in professional and banking fees 76 million outside consulting fees 36 million other expense 22 million employee expense 17 million technology expenses 09 million meeting and client entertainment expense 08 million licenses and fees 06 million business insurance 06 million office supplies 06 million outside services 04 million partially offset by decreases in real estate expenses 10 million bad debt expense 03 million and lease termination related charges 03 million 

the decrease in operating expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreases in business insurance 57 million other expense 27 million real estate expenses 23 million bad debt expense 18 million licenses and fees 14 million meeting and client entertainment expense 09 million employee expense 09 million technology expenses 04 million office supplies 04 million lease termination related charges 04 million partially offset by increases in professional and banking fees 44 million outside consulting fees 28 million and outside services 03 million 

depreciation  depreciation expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 which reflects the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems 

amortization  amortization expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 historically the risk management segment has made few acquisitions in 2017 we made three acquisitions with annualized revenues of approximately 133 million we made no material acquisitions in this segment in 2016 or 2015 no indicators of impairment were noted in 2017 2016 or 2015 

  

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2017 compared to 2016 and the increase in income resulting from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2016 compared to 2015 were due primarily to adjustments made in 2017 and 2015 to the estimated fair value of an earnout obligation related to a revised projections of future performance for two acquisitions during 2017 we recognized 05 million of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2017 and 2015 acquisitions during 2017 and 2015 we recognized 11 million of expense and 05 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance for two acquisitions 

provision for income taxes  we allocate the provision for income taxes to the risk management segment using local statutory rates the risk management segment’s effective tax rate in 2017 2016 and 2015 was 382 382 and 380 respectively in fourth quarter 2017 new tax legislation was enacted in the us which lowered the us corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 the impact of the adjustment of our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2017 to reflect the us rate change on the provision for income taxes in the brokerage segment was immaterial see the us federal income tax law changes and sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 in the corporate segment below for an additional discussion of the impact of the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate on adjusted results of approximately 250 to 270 in our risk management segment for the foreseeable future 

  

corporate segment 

the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our clean energy investments our debt and certain corporate and acquisitionrelated activities see note 13 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a summary of our investments at december 31 2017 and 2016 and a detailed discussion of the nature of these investments see note 7 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a summary of our debt at december 31 2017 and 2016 

financial information relating to our corporate segment results for 2017 2016 and 2015 in millions except per share and percentages 

 

 revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

 the increases in 2017 and 2016 are due to increased production of clean coal 

  

 the decreases in royalty income in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 were due to reductions in production of refined coal by chemmod’s licensees 

expenses related to royalty income of chemmod were 23 million 24 million and 30 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively these expenses are included in the operating expenses discussed below 

 

 the losses in 2017 2016 and 2015 were low because the vast majority of our operations are now consolidated 

 

 in 2017 we recorded a 02 million equity accounting loss related to one of our legacy investments a 01 million gain related to the liquidation of legacy investments and a 01 million gain on the sale of shares in a partially owned entity 

in 2016 we recorded 08 million of rental income related to our new headquarters facility we also recognized 08 million of equity basis accounting losses related to our legacy investments and we recognized a 13 million impairment loss related to clean coal production plants including engineering costs of 07 million incurred for two locations that will not be used 

in 2015 we settled litigation against certain former uk executives and their advisors for a pretax 310 million gain 223 million net of costs and taxes incremental expenses that arose in connection with this matter resulted in aftertax charges of 88 million in 2017 which are presented as an adjustment to the corporate segment also in 2015 we recognized 07 million of equity basis accounting losses related to our legacy investments and 02 million of rental income related to our new headquarters facility 

cost of revenues  cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2017 2016 and 2015 consists of the cost of coal labor equipment maintenance chemicals supplies management fees and depreciation incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above including the costs to run the leased facilities the increases in cost of revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to increased production 

compensation expense  compensation expense for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively was 882 million 726 million and 620 million 

the 156 million increase in 2017 compensation expense compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased staffing salary increases and incentive compensation related to the implementation of a new accounting standard for revenue recognition efforts related to tax reform efforts related to the new headquarters and cleanenergy performance and an increase in benefits expense 

the 106 million increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in retention agreement compensation related to the litigation settlement an increase in incentive compensation due to clean energy performance and an increase in benefits expense 

operating expense  operating expense for 2017 includes banking and related fees of 35 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2017 acquisitions of 106 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 100 million 22 million for a biennial corporatewide meeting corporate related marketing costs of 40 million onetime costs of 122 million related to the new headquarters 53 million of consulting expenses related to the new revenue recognition accounting standard and tax reform and a 16 million net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss 

operating expense for 2016 includes banking and related fees of 32 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2016 acquisitions of 39 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 57 million 48 million for a biennial corporatewide meeting corporate related marketing costs of 70 million and 08 million related to the litigation settlement 

operating expense for 2015 includes banking and related fees of 27 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2015 acquisitions of 37 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 99 million 38 million for a biennial corporatewide meeting and 17 million related to the litigation settlement 

  

interest expense  the increase in interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the following 

 

 the capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new corporate headquarters building that was completed in early 2017 

depreciation  the increase in depreciation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily relates to the new corporate headquarters that was placed in service in first quarter 2017 and to clean coal plants redeployed in 2017 and 2016 the increase in depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily relates to clean coal plants redeployed in 2016 and 2015 

benefit for income taxes  we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our 14 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our 20 2011 era plants our consolidated effective tax rate was 320 247 and 326 for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the tax rates for 2017 2016 and 2015 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year there were 2297 million 1944 million and 1813 million of tax credits produced and recognized in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively also impacting the benefit for the income taxes line was the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement which requires that the income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled rather than recognizing the tax benefits in excess of compensation costs through stockholders’ equity the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the year ended december 31 2017 was 151 million offsetting the impact of these items in 2017 are the tax adjustments discussed below 

us federal income tax law changes  on december 22 2017 the us enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which significantly revises the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 limiting the deductibility of interest expense implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries the timing of our utilization of our tax credits will be impacted by tax reform but their overall gross value to us will not be impacted although we will pay less in taxes overall the lower corporate tax rate will reduce the tax benefit of operating costs associated with the production of refined coal 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act which we refer to as sab 118 describes three scenarios associated with a company’s status of accounting for income tax reform under the sab 118 guidance we have determined that while our accounting for the following elements are incomplete we are able to make reasonable estimates for certain effects of tax reform in our 2017 consolidated financial statements we have recognized provisional amounts for our deferred income taxes and repatriation tax based on reasonable estimates however as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impactions of the tax act as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the us treasury department internal revenue service or other standardsetting bodies we continue to assess information relating to these amounts and with respect to the repatriation tax we continue to assess its application in other jurisdictions additionally we continue to analyze other information and regulatory guidance and accordingly we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts in future periods 

deferred income taxes we have determined that our net deferred tax asset will require revaluation as a result of the tax act we have recognized a provisional 10 million net benefit to the provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2017 as a result of the restatement of our net deferred tax assets 

  

repatriation tax all us shareholders of foreign corporations that own at least 10 must include in their income a onetime inclusion of all accumulated post 1986 undistributed earnings as of december 31 2017 we have recognized a provisional income tax expense of 400 million as a result of this repatriation tax the earnings and profits calculations of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to further refinement as additional information becomes available 

cost recovery while we have not yet completed all of the computations necessary to determine the 2017 expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing we have recorded an immaterial provisional benefit based on our current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures this resulted in a decrease to our current income taxes payable and a corresponding increase in our deferred tax liability 

other items potentially impacting the company going forward 

alternative minimum tax credit the tax act repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax which we refer to as amt for years beginning january 1 2018 and provides that existing amt credit carryovers will be utilized or refunded beginning in 2018 and ending in 2021 according to a specific formula we have approximately 1082 million of amt credit carryovers that are currently reflected as deferred tax assets in the december 31 2017 consolidated balance sheet 

global intangible low taxed income the tax act requires us shareholders to include in income certain “global intangible lowtaxes income” which we refer to as gilti beginning in 2018 we have adopted a policy to include the gilti income in the future period when the tax arises 

base erosion antiabuse tax the tax act introduced the us base erosion and antiabuse tax which we refer to as beat effective january 1 2018 while we must perform additional detailed analyses in order to assess the impact of the beat and further interpretive guidance and clarifications are anticipated we do not currently anticipate any significant long term impact from the beat on our effective income tax rate in future periods 

interest expense limitation under the tax act the deductibility of “net interest” for a business is limited to 30 of adjusted taxable income interest that is disallowed can be carried forward indefinitely we are evaluating the potential impact of this provision 

executive compensation the tax act contains provisions that may limit deductions for executive compensation we are evaluating the potential impact of this provision 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests  the amounts reported in this line for 2017 2016 and 2015 primarily include noncontrolling interest earnings of 331 million 327 million and 369 million respectively related to our investment in chemmod llc as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we held a 465 controlling interest in chemmod llc also included in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are offsetting amounts related to nongallagher owned interests in several clean energy investments 

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2017 2016 and 2015 operating results for the corporate segment in millions 

 

   

 interest and banking costs and debt  interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt clean energy related includes the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production plants and chemmod 

acquisition costs  consists of professional fees due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions 

corporate  consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and other corporate level activities costs related to biennial companywide award event crossselling and motivational meetings for our production staff and field management expenses related to our new corporate headquarters corporate related marketing costs and expenses for systems and consulting related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting and tax reform rules 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we incurred 89 million of pretax costs related to implementing a new accounting standard related to how companies recognize revenue which was effective beginning in january 2018 we expect to incur costs related to implementing this new accounting standard through first quarter 2018 these charges are included in the corporate segment a new accounting pronouncement asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting was effective january 1 2017 it requires that the income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement in the income tax benefit column above when the awards vest or are settled rather than recognizing the tax benefits in excess of compensation costs through stockholders’ equity the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the year ended december 31 2017 was 151 million and is included in the table above in the corporate line the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 was 65 million and 53 million respectively and is not included in the income tax benefit column above 

litigation settlement  during the third quarter of 2015 we settled litigation against certain former uk executives and their advisors for a pretax gain of 310 million 223 million net of costs and taxes in third quarter incremental aftertax expenses that arose in connection with this matter was 88 million and 161 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively and incremental aftertax income with this matter was 177 million in 2015 

home office lease terminationmove  during 2017 we relocated our corporate office headquarters to a nearby suburb of chicago aftertax onetime move and aftertax lease abandonment charges were 79 million in 2017 these charges are presented in the corporate segment 

tax adjustments  in the fourth quarter of 2017 the tax act was enacted in the us which lowered the us corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 accordingly based on reasonable estimates we adjusted our us deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2017 to reflect this rate change and we also incurred a onetime provisional repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings these items plus the impact of some permanent tax differences resulted in a net charge of approximately 270 million in the aggregate in the fourth quarter of 2017 pretax costs incurred related to tax reform were 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the ultimate impact of the tax act may differ from these estimated provisions as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the us treasury department internal revenue service or other standardsetting bodies 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the 14 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the 20 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

  

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2017 in millions 

 

 the estimated earnings information in the table reflects management’s current best estimate of the 2018 low and high ranges of aftertax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities and other operating assumptions including current us federal income tax laws however coalfired power plants may not ultimately produce refined fuel at estimated levels due to seasonal electricity demand production costs natural gas prices weather conditions as well as many other operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates 

our investment in chemmod generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates 

we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to coinvestors and relinquish control of the plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling minority investor the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control as of any future date we become a noncontrolling minority investor we would deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting 

we currently have no construction commitments related to our refined coal plants 

we are aware that some of the coalfired power plants that purchase the refined coal are considering changing to burning natural gas rather than coal or shutting down completely for economic reasons the entities that own such plants are prepared to move the refined coal plants to another coalfired power plant if necessary if these potential developments were to occur we estimate those refined coal plants will not operate for 12 to 18 months during their movement and redeployment this would result in only the 2011 era plants being able to be moved and deployed in the future and the new coalfired power plant may be a higher or lower volume plant all of which could have a material impact on the amount of tax credits that are generated by these plants 

there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 

  

   

see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 13 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2017 2016 and 2015 we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and issuances of our common stock 

cash provided by operating activities was 8542 million 6496 million and 6861 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improved cash flow generated from our core brokerage and risk management operating units the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of client fiduciary related balances in 2016 compared to 2015 the following table summarizes two lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2017 2016 and 2015 in millions 

 

 in addition cash provided by operating activities for 2016 and 2015 were unfavorably impacted by acquisition related integration costs during second quarter 2015 we entered into compensationbased retention agreements with certain key employees of our international brokerage operations these retention agreements added aftertax charges of 73 million 154 million and 102 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively to our compensation expense our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted if the amount of irc section 45 tax credits generated which is the amount we recognize for financial reporting purposes is greater than the amount of tax credits actually used to reduce our tax cash obligation excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 4631 million 4144 million and 3568 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively consolidated ebitdac was 9189 million 8496 million and 7713 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2017 2016 and 2015 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2017 2016 and 2015 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan 

  

see note 12 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in 2017 the funded status of the plans was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2017 the impact of which was approximately 92 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2017 than anticipated by approximately 107 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2017 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2017 of 15 million in 2016 the funded status of the plans was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2016 the impact of which was approximately 82 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2016 than anticipated by approximately 03 million and improvements in the mortality assumptions of 43 million and other pension gains of 44 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2016 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2016 of 08 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2017 2016 and 2015 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 1292 million 2178 million and 990 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively of which 118 million 1121 million and 133 million respectively related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in addition 2017 capital expenditures include amounts incurred related to investments made in information technology and software development projects in 2018 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 1250 million part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters we received property tax related credits under a taxincrement financing note from rolling meadows illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit incentives from these two programs could total between 600 million and 800 million over a fifteenyear period the net capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2017 the net capital expenditures in 2016 and 2015 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in 2016 and 2015 and the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2016 and 2015 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 3761 million 2434 million and 2496 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of acquisitions than occurred in 2016 and we used less of our common stock to fund acquisitions in 2017 the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions that occurred in 2016 in addition during 2017 2016 and 2015 we issued 10 million shares 596 million 20 million shares 896 million and 73 million shares 3389 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 39 37 and 44 acquisitions in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2017 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately 1723 million 1379 million and 2308 million respectively in 2018 we expect to use new debt our credit agreement cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete 

dispositions  during 2017 2016 and 2015 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 34 million 66 million and 67 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 32 million 78 million and 92 million respectively related to these transactions 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2017 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate of the 2018 annual net after tax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2018 is 1050 million to 1150 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants by capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2018 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time nonetheless if current ownership interests remain the same if capital expenditures related to 

  

redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remain as currently anticipated and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2018 through at least 2021 while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see “clean energy investments” on pages 52 to 54 for a more detailed description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties 

cash flows from financing activities 

on april 8 2016 we entered into an amendment and restatement to our multicurrency credit agreement dated september 19 2013 which we refer to as the credit agreement with a group of fifteen financial institutions the amendment and restatement among other things extended the expiration date of the credit agreement from september 19 2018 to april 8 2021 and increased the revolving credit commitment from 6000 million to 8000 million of which 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 750 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment under the credit agreement up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 11000 million there were 1900 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2017 due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit 5928 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2017

consistent with past practice we have entered into preissuance hedging transactions for 2000 million related to each of the 2018 and 2019 1000 million note maturities 

the note purchase agreements the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2017 

  

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2017 we declared 2836 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 156 per common share on december 15 2017 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 039 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 1 2017 on january 24 2018 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2018 of 041 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 041 per common share throughout 2018 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2018 of approximately 2971 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2017 or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately 144 million compared to 2017 we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

shelf registration statement  on november 15 2016 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any shares under this registration statement on april 2 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 with the sec registering 80 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses assets or securities at december 31 2017 01 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement on november 15 2016 we filed another shelf registration statement on form s4 with the sec registering an additional 100 million shares of our common stock none of which had been issued as of december 31 2017 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors during the year ended december 31 2017 we repurchased 03 million shares of our common stock at cost of 177 million during the year ended december 31 2016 we repurchased 23 million shares of our common stock at cost of 1010 million we did not repurchase any shares in 2015 under the provisions of the repurchase plan we are authorized to repurchase approximately 75 million additional shares at december 31 2017 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 604 million in 2017 456 million in 2016 and 542 million in 2015 on may 16 2017 our stockholders approved the 2017 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2014 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 162 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip – 40 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of december 31 2017 were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2017 our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 7 13 and 15 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2017 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 109 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 17 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

see note 7 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2017 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 15 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all but one of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 459 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2013 to 2017 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 5679 million of which 2642 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2017 and 2016 that was recourse to us 

  

at december 31 2017 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 97 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 128 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2017 we had posted seven letters of credit totaling 63 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity one letter of credit totaling 07 million to support our potential obligation under a client’s insurance program for which we have a recorded liability of 07 million and one letter of credit totaling 05 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisition’s lease these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2017 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and our cash equivalents as of december 31 2017 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2017 

as of december 31 2017 we had 27980 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2017 was 29207 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purposes of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us based on our current estimated credit rating 

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2017 and the resulting fair values would be 3144 million higher than their carrying value or 31124 million we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2017 and the resulting fair values would be 538 million lower than their carrying value or 27442 million 

as of december 31 2017 we had 1900 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement the fair values of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2017 and the resulting fair value is not be materially different from their carrying value 

  

at december 31 2017 we had 1511 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility the fair values of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2017 and the resulting fair value is not materially different from their carrying value 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our uk australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean and south american operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2017 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 97 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2017 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 94 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss 

we do not enter into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india the uk and other countries we have periodically purchased financial instruments to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2017 2016 and 2015 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our future us denominated revenues within our uk subsidiaries in 2017 and 2016 and disbursements in 2015 through various future payment dates in addition during 2017 and 2016 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged we also incur foreign currency exchange rate risk for our foreign operations where we choose not to hedge such risk in those operations all of these hedges are accounted for in accordance with asc 815 “derivatives and hedging” and periodically are tested for effectiveness in accordance with such guidance in the scenario where such hedge does not pass the effectiveness test the hedge will be remeasured at the stated point and the appropriate gain or loss if applicable would be recognized for the year ended december 31 2017 there has been no such effect on our consolidated financial presentation the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2017 2016 and 2015 see note 18 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2017 2016 and 2015

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commission and fee revenues and the related brokerage and marketing expenses can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of irc section 45 tax credits also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 19 to our 2016 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2016 and 2015

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 13 of our revenues in 2016 our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments approximately 68 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers’ compensationrelated claims 28 are from general and commercial auto liabilityrelated claims and 4 are from propertyrelated claims in addition we generate revenues from integrated disability management employee absence management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from 

 

  

  

  

 corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 24 of our revenues in 2016 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate costs the revenues reported by this segment in 2016 resulted almost solely from our consolidation of refined fuel operations of which we control and own more than 50 of those operations at december 31 2016 significant investments managed by this segment include 

clean coalrelated ventures 

we have a 465 interest in chemmod llc chemmod a privatelyheld enterprise that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we also have a 120 interest in a privatelyheld startup enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels 

taxadvantaged investments 

in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s proprietary technologies and in 2013 we purchased a 99 interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five commercial clean coal production plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

  

international operations 

our total revenues by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016 were as follows in millions 

 

 total revenues generated by our uk and australian based operations decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to unfavorable foreign currency translation see notes 6 17 and 20 to our 2016 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2016 2015 and 2014 

international and other brokerage related operations 

the majority of our international brokerage operations are in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk targeting small to medium enterprise risks 

we operate primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker throughout more than 35 locations in australia 35 locations in canada and 25 locations in new zealand in the uk we operate as a retail broker from approximately 100 locations we also have an underwriting operation for clients to access lloyd’s of london and other international insurance markets and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities 

in bermuda we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of independent brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through this global network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in more than 150 countries around the world 

captive insurance companies  we have ownership interests in several insurance and reinsurance companies based in the us bermuda gibraltar guernsey isle of man and malta that primarily operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these “rentacaptive” facilities enable our clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive insurance companies or “rentacaptive” facilities are created for clients to insure their risks and capture any underwriting profit and investment income which would then be available for use by the insureds generally to reduce future costs of their insurance programs in general these companies are set up as protected cell companies that are comprised of separate cell business units which we refer to as captive cells and the core regulated company which we refer to as the core company the core company is owned and operated by us and no insurance policies are assumed by the core company all insurance is assumed or written within individual captive cells only the activity of the supporting core company of the rentacaptive facility is recorded in our consolidated financial statements including cash and stockholder’s equity of the legal entity and any expenses incurred to operate the rentacaptive facility most captive cells reinsure individual lines of insurance coverage from external insurance companies in addition some captive cells offer individual lines of insurance coverage from one of our insurance company subsidiaries the different types of insurance coverage include special property general liability products liability medical professional liability other liability and medical stop loss the policies are generally claimsmade insurance policies are written by an insurance company and the risk is assumed by each of the captive cells in general we structure these operations to have no underwriting risk on a net written basis in situations where we have assumed underwriting risk on a net written basis we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for the underwriting risk we have assumed from our clients we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to limit our risk 

  

we have a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary based in the us that cedes all of its insurance risk to reinsurers or captives under facultative and quotashare treaty reinsurance agreements these reinsurance arrangements diversify our business and minimize our exposure to losses or hazards of an unusual nature the ceding of insurance does not discharge us of our primary liability to the policyholder in the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations we would be liable for such defaulted amounts therefore we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers or captives in order to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer credit risk and insolvencies we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for which we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to fully offset the risk see note 16 to our 2016 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to the insurance activity of our wholly owned insurance company subsidiary for 2016 2015 and 2014 

international risk management operations 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the us and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

see item 1a “risk factors” for information regarding risks attendant to these foreign operations 

markets and marketing 

we manage our brokerage operations through a network of more than 600 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 32 other countries we manage our third party claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2016 our largest single customer accounted for approximately 1 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments and our ten largest customers represented 3 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the aggregate our revenues are geographically diversified with both domestic and international operations 

each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small marketshare position and as a result we believe has substantial organic growth potential in addition each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small to mediumsized independent brokerages see “business combinations” below 

while historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically and we expect to continue to do so from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment 

we require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities plus all of our executive officers to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 18 2016 edition we were the world’s fourth largest insurance broker based on revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete globally with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis towers watson public limited company each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as jardine lloyd thomson group plc wells fargo insurance services inc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation operate globally or nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients in addition for healthwelfare products and benefit consultant services we compete with larger firms such as aon hewitt mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc willis towers watson public limited company midmarket firms such as lockton usi holdings and wells fargo and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies 

our wholesale brokerage and binding operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers 

we also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

  

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as one of the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrators based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s march 24 2016 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company esis a subsidiary of chubb limited and corvel several large insurance companies such as travelers and liberty mutual also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position are reputation for outstanding service and the ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most costefficient manner possible 

regulation 

we are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business in addition most jurisdictions require individuals who engage in brokerage claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed these licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in most jurisdictions licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities 

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 420 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2016 almost exclusively within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local propertycasualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of our nichepractice groups over the last decade we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas the total purchase price for individual acquisitions has typically ranged from 10 million to 500 million although in 2014 we completed three large acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price consideration in excess of 17 billion 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

 item 1a  risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

an overall economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

an overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected our growing operations in countries and regions undergoing economic downturns particularly in the uk australia and certain emerging markets expose us to risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example approximately 20 of our brokerage segment and approximately 3 of our risk management segment revenues came from the uk in 2016 in a referendum held on june 23 2016 a majority of voters in the uk voted in favor of the uk leaving the european union this vote to leave has created significant uncertainty regarding the uk economic outlook and could lead to a decline in economic activity a recession or reduced future growth prospects in the uk any of which could damage our clients’ confidence and materially and adversely affect our business 

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for insurance companies or reduced insurer capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients and the failure of errors and omissions insurance carriers could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition if carriers merge or if a large carrier fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage overall underwriting capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability 

  

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to precisely forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commissionbased compensation 

contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations 

a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume or growth thresholds or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent commissions or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets which have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms 

the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

   

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technology change we must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs 

in some cases we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is one of our key assets we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees could damage our reputation any resulting erosion of trust and confidence among existing and potential clients regulators stockholders and other parties important to the success of our business could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefits consulting firms and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth particularly in our brokerage segment and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equitybacked consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically 

postacquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology human resources or organizational culture and fit some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as jiang tai re our joint venture with jiang tai insurance brokers in china or casanueva perez sap de cv grupo cp in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain both new talent and experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers along with their client and business relationships to competitors such departures could lead to the loss of clients and intellectual property the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments or our inability to identify recruit and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our substantial operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

in 2016 we generated approximately 31 of our revenues outside the us including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations for example we have substantial operations in india to provide certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

following the recent presidential election in the us the foreign and international trade policies of the us could change in ways that exacerbate the risks described above or introduce new risks for our international operations if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

a large and growing portion of our business is located outside the us some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations in the uk the vote to leave the european union may result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets and may lead to a sustained weakness in the british pound’s exchange rate against the us dollar any significant weakening of the british pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segment revenues and earnings as reported in us dollars 

we face a variety of risks in our third party claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations 

our third party claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster cybersecurity attack or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations damage our reputation and impact client relationships 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located for example our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services 

  

disruptions could be caused by among other things restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics cybersecurity attacks or outages to electrical communications or other services we use our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business we have disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies however such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services we anticipate moving our corporate headquarters during the first quarter of 2017 any major disruption in the move or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations the occurrence of such events could also cause reputational harm and damage our client relationships 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data whether due to human error misuse of information by employees or vendors or as a result of cyberattacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information and financial information in many jurisdictions particularly in the us and the european union we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors 

we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business in the future these types of incidents could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data compromise confidential business information result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data which could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business cyber threats are constantly evolving which makes it more difficult to detect cybersecurity incidents assess their severity or impact in a timely manner and successfully defend against them 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance it is possible that the steps we follow including our security controls over personal data and training of employees on data security may not prevent improper access to disclosure of or misuse of confidential personal or proprietary information this could cause harm to our reputation create legal exposure or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors we have processes designed to require third party it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate for example in 2015 the european court of justice invalidated a key safe harbor relied upon by many businesses to transfer personal data legally from the european union to the us there is a growing body of international data protection law which in part includes security breach notification obligations more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance in addition legislators in the us are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace 

  

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable 

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the securities and exchange commission sec the department of justice doj the internal revenue service irs and the office of foreign assets control ofac in the us the financial conduct authority fca in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including increased staffing needs the development of new policies procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition in light of recent events associated with the planned exit of the uk from the european union we will likely face new regulatory costs and challenges for example our uk operations could lose their european union financial services passport which provides them the license to operate across borders within the single european union market without obtaining local regulatory approval 

changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business 

for example the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from insurance companies separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental commissions and payments for consulting and analytics services provided to insurance carriers future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these additional revenue streams adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client insurer or other relationships 

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws sanctioned parties restrictions and fatca 

in foreign countries where we operate a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance however we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

we remain subject to the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm 

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate us trade sanctions administered by ofac the european union and the united nations and trade sanction laws such as the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

  

in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 health care reform legislation 

the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies initiatives by the incoming presidential administration to change certain aspects of this legislation may increase such complexity many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns in addition if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory and claims handling services there is the risk that our employees or subagents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decisionmaking services to clients if these clients experience investment losses our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the irs in addition we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we our subsidiary gallagher clean energy llc and chemmod llc are liable for infringement of a patent held by nalco company an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

  

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards such as new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations see note 2 to our 2016 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts the new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases could have on our future financial position and operating results 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments our ability to generate returns and avoid writeoffs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties these include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties set forth below 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals there are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability failure of the chemmod™ solution utilized at coalfired generation facilities for example could result in violations of air emissions permits which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability additionally some environmental laws without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chemmod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution in addition we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators or other end users will result in that facility owner or operator or other end user accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators or other end users will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and this could result in environmental or product liability claims it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage nuisance diminution of property value or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim and defense of such claims can be costly even when such defense prevails if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2016 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 27 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates it will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to stockholders acquisitions capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

  

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments and require us to comply with certain financial covenants the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock 

further we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the us in the event we are unable to meet these us based cash requirements 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient manner 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected 

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units performance stock units options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest our stockholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 

the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors including the risk factors described above many of which are outside our control in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 stockholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” beginning on page 31 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures 

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and third party propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and our customers and we do not assume net underwriting risks we are headquartered in itasca illinois have operations in 33 other countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in 2016 we expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth we generate approximately 69 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 31 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk based on 2016 revenues we expect that our international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues in 2017 will be comparable to 2016 we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 63 13 and 24 respectively to 2016 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds clean energy and other investments and interest income from premium financing 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas as markets harden certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance 

  

our brokerage clients have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab 2016 quarterly surveys indicated that us commercial propertycasualty rates decreased by 37 39 32 and 33 on average across all lines for the first second third and fourth quarters of 2016 respectively the fourth quarter 2016 ciab survey indicated that rates declined for the eighth straight quarter ciab survey respondents noted that the decrease in rates during the fourth quarter of 2016 were fairly consistent with the third quarter of 2016 signaling some stability in the market in 2017 while we see retail propertycasualty rates as a headwind we do see propertycasualty exposure growth offsetting this partially we also see employment growth and complexity surrounding the affordable care act as tailwinds for our employee benefit units in addition our history of strong new business generation solid retentions and enhanced valueadded services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world we believe similar conditions exist as we start the january 1 2017 renewal season internationally we see a similar market in uk retail canada australia and new zealand but more softening in london specialty overall we believe a modestlydown rate environment can be partially mitigated through exposure unit growth in certain lines and by our professionals demonstrating our expertise and high quality value added capabilities by strengthening our clients’ insurance portfolio in these times based on our experience insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions in lines and accounts where rate increases or decreases are warranted the underwriters are pricing accordingly as carriers reach their profitability targets in lines rates may start to flatten in summary in this environment rates decreased at a moderate pace clients can still obtain coverage businesses continue to stay in standardline markets and there is adequate capacity in the insurance market it is not clear whether the rate retraction will continue due to the uncertainty of the current economic environment the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

clean energy investments  in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s see below proprietary technologies on september 1 2013 we purchased a 99 interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five clean coal production plants on march 1 2014 we purchased an additional ownership interest in seven of the 2009 era plants and five of the 2011 era plants from a coinvestor for all seven of the 2009 era plants our ownership increased from 495 to 1000 for the 2011 era plants our ownership increased from 488 to 900 for one of the plants from 490 to 1000 for three of the plants and from 980 to 1000 for one of the plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

thirtyone plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities the remaining three plants are in early stages of seeking and negotiating longterm production contracts 

we also own a 465 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chemmod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 40 million to 50 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

our current estimate of the 2017 annual net after tax earnings that could be generated from all of our clean energy investments in 2017 is between 1170 million to 1330 million 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition  see revenue recognition in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our 2016 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition could have on our future financial position and operating results 

income taxes  see income taxes in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  see intangible assets in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections that are developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2016 business combinations

 organic revenues a nongaap measure   for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition change in base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the impact of claim portfolio transfer ramp up fees client runoff bankruptcy costs and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2017 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this nongaap measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 63 of our revenue in 2016 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

litigation and regulatory matters  a portion of our brokerage business includes the development and management of “microcaptives” through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of tribeca strategic advisors tribeca a “captive” is an insurance company that insures the risks of its owner affiliates or a group of companies microcaptives are captive insurance companies that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under irc section 831b our microcaptive advisory services are under investigation by the internal revenue service irs additionally the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the microcaptive insurance companies organized andor managed by us among other matters the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations while the irs has not made specific allegations relating to our operations or the preacquisition activities of tribeca if the irs were to successfully assert that the microcaptives organized andor managed by us do not meet the requirements of irc section 831b we could be subject to monetary claims by the irs andor our microcaptive clients and our future earnings from our microcaptive operations could be materially adversely affected any of which event could negatively impact the overall captive business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition we may also experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended irs investigation on our clients’ and potential clients’ businesses annual renewals for microcaptive clients generally occur during the fourth quarter therefore any negative impact from this investigation would likely have a disproportionate impact on fourthquarter results in 2016 2015 and 2014 our microcaptive operations contributed less than 35 million of net earnings and less than 50 million of ebitdac to our consolidated results in any one year due to the fact that the irs has not made any allegation against us or completed all of its audits of our clients we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation

operating expense for 2014 includes banking and related fees of 27 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2014 acquisitions of 189 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 128 million and 22 million for a biennial corporatewide meeting 

  

interest expense  the increase in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 was due to the following 

 

 the capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new corporate headquarters building will occur until the development of it is completed in early 2017 

depreciation  the increase in depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily relates to clean coal plants redeployed in 2016 and 2015 the increase in depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily relates to the assets of the additional ownership interests in the clean coal plants that we acquired from coinvestors in 2014 and clean coal plants redeployed in 2015 

benefit for income taxes  we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our twenty 2011 era plants our consolidated effective tax rate was 247 326 and 123 for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the tax rates for 2016 2015 and 2014 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year there were 1944 million 1813 million and 1455 million of tax credits produced and recognized in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

potential us federal income tax law changes  the value of our tax credits could be impacted by changes in the tax code as a result of the recent presidential and congressional elections in the us congress could modify or repeal irc section 45 and remove the tax credits either prospectively or through the elimination of the carryover of the credits which would adversely affect the value of our investment also if congress reduces tax rates although we might pay less in taxes overall it would reduce the tax benefit of operating costs associated with the production of refined coal although we are unable to predict how a reduction in tax rates during 2017 would affect our cash taxes paid in 2017 we estimate that if the us federal corporate income tax rate had been reduced from 35 to 20 and if the alternative minimum tax had been eliminated as of january 1 2016 our cash taxes paid for fiscal 2016 would have been 391 million rather than 661 million 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests  the amounts reported in this line for 2016 2015 and 2014 primarily include noncontrolling interest earnings of 327 million 369 million and 353 million respectively related to the nongallagher owned interest in chemmod as of december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we held a 465 controlling interest in chemmod also included in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are offsetting amounts related to nongallagher owned interests in several clean energy investments 

  

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2016 2015 and 2014 operating results for the corporate segment in millions 

 

  

    during 2017 we will be relocating our corporate office headquarters to a nearby suburb of chicago onetime move and aftertax lease abandonment charges are expected to total approximately 25 million 40 million and 15 million in first second and third quarters of 2017 these charges will be presented in the corporate segment 

interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt clean energy related includes the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production plants and chemmod acquisition costs include professional fees due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions corporate consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation costs related to biennial companywide award crossselling and motivational meetings for our production staff and field management expenses related to our new corporate headquarters corporate related marketing costs and in 2016 and 2015 retention agreement compensation related to the litigation settlement 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the fourteen plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the twenty plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

  

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2016 in millions 

 

 the estimated earnings information in the table reflects management’s current best estimate of the 2017 low and high ranges of aftertax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities other operating assumptions and us federal income tax laws in place at december 31 2016 however coalfired power plants may not ultimately produce refined fuel at estimated levels due to seasonal electricity demand production costs natural gas prices weather conditions as well as many other operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates 

our investment in chemmod generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties future changes in epa regulations or us federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates 

we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to coinvestors and relinquish control of the plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling minority investor the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control as of any future date we become a noncontrolling minority investor we would deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting 

we currently have 27 million of construction commitments related to our refined coal plants 

we are aware that some of the coalfired power plants that purchase the refined coal are considering changing to burning natural gas rather than coal or shutting down completely for economic reasons the entities that own such plants are prepared to move the refined coal plants to another coalfired power plant if necessary if these potential developments were to occur we estimate those refined coal plants will not operate for 12 to 18 months during their movement and redeployment and the new coalfired power plant may be a higher or lower volume plant all of which could have a material impact on the amount of tax credits that are generated by these plants 

  

there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 

  

 see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2016 2015 and 2014 we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes issuances of our common stock and a secondary public offering of our common stock in april 2014 in which 2185 million shares of our stock were issued for net proceeds after underwriting discounts and other expenses related to this offering of 9114 million 

cash provided by operating activities was 6221 million 6526 million and 4366 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of client fiduciary related balances in 2016 compared to 2015 the following table summarizes three lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2016 2015 and 2014 in millions 

 

 in addition cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was impacted by an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of 1127 million compared to an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of 1544 million in 2015 and by acquisition related integration costs in 2016 and 2015 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2015 compared to 2014 partially offset by cash used in 2015 in the production and sale of refined coal at the plants qualified to receive refined 

  

coal tax credits under irc section 45 in addition cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was adversely impacted by an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of 1544 million compared to an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of 1415 million in 2014 and an increase in acquisition related integration costs in 2015 also negatively impacting cash provided by operating activities between 2015 and 2014 was cash payments related to compensationbased retention agreements during second quarter 2015 we entered into compensationbased retention agreements with certain key employees of our international brokerage operations we estimate that these retention agreements will add aftertax charges of approximately 45 million per quarter through june 30 2017 to our compensation expense our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted by the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized compared to the amount of tax credits actually used during the respective periods excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 4144 million and 3568 million consolidated ebitdac was 8496 million and 7713 million for 2016 and 2015 respectively we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2016 and 2015 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2016 and 2015 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan we are not considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2017 but may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the plan in future periods 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in august 2014 we decided to pursue a pension derisking strategy to reduce the size of our longterm us defined benefit pension plan obligations and the volatility of these obligations on our balance sheet on september 12 2014 the fiduciaries of the plan began offering certain former employees who were participants in the plan the option of receiving the value of their pension benefit in a lump sum payment or as an accelerated reduced annuity in lieu of monthly annuity payments when they retire the voluntary offer was made to approximately 2500 terminated vested participants in the plan whose employment terminated with the company prior to august 1 2014 and who had not commenced benefit payments as of november 1 2014 eligible participants had from september 12 2014 to november 30 2014 to accept the offer and the lumpsum payments were made in november and december of 2014 and the accelerated reduced annuity payments began as of december 1 2014 the aggregate lump sum payout made in fourth quarter 2014 was 433 million all payouts related to this offer were made using assets from the plan this lump sum payout project reduced the plan’s pension benefit obligation by approximately 600 million while improving its pension underfunding by almost 170 million as of december 31 2014 due to this significant obligation settlement we incurred a noncash pretax charge of approximately 120 million in fourth quarter 2014 as a result of the us gaap requirement to expense the portion of the unrealized actuarial losses currently recognized as accumulated other comprehensive loss based on a ratio of the liability settled to the total liability within the plan at december 31 2014 

  

in 2016 the funded status of the plans was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2016 the impact of which was approximately 82 million however the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being higher in 2016 than anticipated by approximately 03 million and improvements in the mortality assumptions of 43 million and other pension gains of 44 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2016 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2016 of 08 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2016 2015 and 2014 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 2178 million 990 million and 815 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively of which 1121 million 133 million and 163 million respectively related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in 2017 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 1350 million part of which is related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building approximately 200 million office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters we expect to receive property tax related credits under a taxincrement financing note from rolling meadows illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit incentives from these two programs could total between 600 million and 800 million over a fifteenyear period the net capital expenditures in 2016 2015 and 2014 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in 2016 and 2015 and the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2016 2015 and 2014 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 3273 million 3423 million and 19183 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions that occurred in 2016 the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions that occurred in 2015 in addition during 2016 2015 and 2014 we issued 20 million shares 896 million 73 million shares 3389 million and 65 million shares 2928 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 37 44 and 60 acquisitions in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2016 2015 and 2014 totaled approximately 1379 million 2308 million and 7612 million respectively in 2017 we expect to use our debt cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete 

dispositions  during 2016 2015 and 2014 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 66 million 67 million and 73 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 78 million 92 million and 82 million respectively related to these transactions 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2016 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate of the 2017 annual net after tax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2017 is 1170 million to 1330 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants by capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2017 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time nonetheless if current ownership interests remain the same if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remain as currently anticipated and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2017 through at least 2021 while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see “clean energy investments” on pages 48 to 50 for a more detailed description of these investments including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties 

cash flows from financing activities 

on april 8 2016 we entered into an amendment and restatement to our multicurrency credit agreement dated september 19 2013 which we refer to as the credit agreement with a group of fifteen financial institutions the amendment and restatement among other things extended the expiration date of the credit agreement from september 19 2018 to april 8 2021 and increased the revolving credit commitment from 6000 million to 8000 million of which 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 750 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment under the credit agreement up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 11000 million there were 2780 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2016 due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit 5009 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2016 

  

we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time during 2016 we borrowed an aggregate of 27400 million and repaid 26570 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2016 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2015 we borrowed an aggregate of 8490 million and repaid 7940 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2015 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2014 we borrowed an aggregate of 11099 million and repaid 15004 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2014 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes 

we have a secured revolving loan facility which we refer to as the premium financing debt facility that provides funding for the three australian au and new zealand nz premium finance subsidiaries the premium financing debt facility is comprised of i facility b with is separated into au1500 million and nz350 million tranches ii facility c an au250 million equivalent multicurrency overdraft tranche and iii facility d a nz150 million equivalent multicurrency overdraft tranche the premium financing debt facility expires may 18 2017 at december 31 2016 1256 million of borrowings were outstanding under the premium financing debt facility 

we use the premium financing debt facility to borrow funds to fund the premium financing activities of three of our australian au and new zealand nz subsidiaries in 2016 and 2015 we had net borrowings of 122 million and 239 million respectively on the premium financing debt facility 

at december 31 2016 we had 27280 million of corporaterelated borrowings outstanding under separate note purchase agreements entered into in the period 2007 to 2016 and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 5455 million see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement 

we completed a 2750 million ten year maturity private placement debt transaction in 2016 with a weighted average interest rate of 447 in 2016 we entered into a preissuance interest rate hedging transaction related to the 1750 million 10 year tranche of the 2750 million private placement debt we realized a cash gain of approximately 10 million on the hedging transaction that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as a reduction in our reported interest expense over the ten year life of the debt 

on november 30 2016 we funded the 500 million 2016 maturity of our series c note 

we completed a 1000 million eleven year maturity private placement debt transaction on december 1 2016 with an interest rate of 346 a portion of the proceeds was used to fund the 500 million of private placement debt that matured on november 30 2016 

we anticipate raising at least 3000 million in the second half of 2017 primarily to refinance the august 2017 3000 million maturity of our series b note 

the note purchase agreements the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2016 

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2016 we declared 2725 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 152 per common share on december 16 2016 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 038 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 2 2016 on january 25 2017 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2017 of 039 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 039 per common share throughout 2017 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2017 of approximately 2781 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2016 or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately 59 million compared to 2016 we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors we repurchased 23 million shares of our common stock at cost of 1010 million 77 million remain available we did not repurchase any shares in 2015 and 2014 under the provisions of the repurchase plan we were authorized to repurchase approximately 10000000 additional shares at december 31 2016 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources there were no common stock repurchases made in 2015 and 2014 that impacted our consolidated financial statements 

  

atthemarket equity program  on november 20 2013 we entered into an equity distribution agreement with morgan stanley  co llc pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to 200 million of which 156 million is remaining of our common stock through morgan stanley as sales agent pursuant to the agreement shares may be sold by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions including on the new york stock exchange at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices in block transactions or as otherwise agreed upon by us and morgan stanley during 2016 we did not sell any shares of our common stock under the program 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 456 million in 2016 541 million in 2015 and 563 million in 2014 

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 7 13 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2016 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation outstanding purchase commitments in the table above include 106 million related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2016 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 145 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2016 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

  

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 420 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2013 to 2016 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 5272 million of which 2423 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2016 and 2015 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2016 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 93 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 123 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2016 we had posted seven letters of credit totaling 63 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity one letter of credit totaling 50 million to support our potential obligation under a client’s insurance program and one letter of credit totaling 05 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisition’s lease these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2016 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and our cash equivalents as of december 31 2016 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2016 

as of december 31 2016 we had 24500 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2016 was 25450 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purposes of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us based on our current estimated credit rating 

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2016 and the resulting fair values would be 2416 million higher than their carrying value or 26916 million we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2016 and the resulting fair values would be 405 million lower than their carrying value or 24095 million 

  

as of december 31 2016 we had 2780 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2016 and the resulting fair value is not be materially different from their carrying value 

at december 31 2016 we had 1256 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2016 and the resulting fair value is not materially different from their carrying value 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our uk australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean and south american operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2016 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 67 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2016 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 115 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss 

historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india norway and the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2016 2015 and 2014 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues in 2016 and disbursements in 2015 through various future payment dates in addition during 2016 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2016 2015 and 2014 see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2016 2015 and 2014 we entered into an au4000 million foreign currency derivative investment contract that we executed on april 16 2014 in connection with the signing of the agreement to acquire the crombieoamps operations this contract was designed to hedge a portion of the au dollar denominated purchase price consideration of this acquisition the derivative investment contract was exercised on june 16 2014 the date that the crombieoamps transaction closed in second quarter 2014 we recorded a pretax gain of 19 million related to this derivative investment contract these contracts were designed to hedge a portion of the gbp denominated purchase price consideration of this acquisition

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations information with respect to all sources of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015 is as follows in millions 

 

 see 19 to our 2015 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information including earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2015 2014 and 2013 

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commission and fee revenues and the related brokerage and marketing expenses can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of irc section 45 tax credits also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 18 to our 2015 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2015 and 2014 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 62 of our revenues in 2015 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and healthcare exchange and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon either a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

we operate our brokerage operations through a network of more than 570 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 30 other countries most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel in addition we offer clientservice capabilities in more than 150 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 

  

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 83 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2015 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows 

 

 our retail brokerage operations are organized into approximately 500 office locations primarily located in the us australia canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 68 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups we serve are as follows 

 

 our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries or business segments we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

 

  

  

  

 wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 17 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2015 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance these brokers operate through more than 70 office locations primarily located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer’s business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

more than 80 of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as one of the largest domestic managing general agentsunderwriting managerswholesale brokerslloyds coverholders according to business insurance magazine’s august 31 2015 edition

 corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 25 of our revenues in 2015 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate costs the revenues reported by this segment in 2015 resulted primarily from our consolidation of refined fuel operations that we control and own more than 50 of and from leased facilities we operate and control at december 31 2015 significant investments managed by this segment include 

clean coal related ventures 

we have a 465 interest in chemmod llc chemmod a privatelyheld enterprise that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we also have a 120 interest in a privatelyheld startup enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels 

taxadvantaged investments 

in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s proprietary technologies and in 2013 we purchased a 99 interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five commercial clean coal production plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants

 see notes 6 16 and 17 to our 2015 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2015 2014 and 2013 

international and other brokerage related operations 

the majority of our international brokerage operations are in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk targeting small to medium enterprise risks 

we operate primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker throughout more than 35 locations in australia 35 locations in canada and 25 locations in new zealand in the uk we operate as a retail broker from approximately 90 locations we also have an underwriting operation for clients to access the lloyd’s of london and other international insurance markets and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities 

in bermuda we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 150 countries we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area 

captive insurance companies 

we have ownership interests in several insurance and reinsurance companies based in the us bermuda gibraltar guernsey isle of man and malta that primarily operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these “rentacaptive” facilities enable our clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive insurance companies or “rentacaptive” facilities are created for clients to insure their risks and capture any underwriting profit and investment income which would then be available for use by the insureds generally to reduce future costs of their insurance programs in general these companies are set up as protected cell companies that are comprised of separate cell business units which we refer to as captive cells and the core regulated company which we refer to as the core company the core company is owned and operated by us and no insurance policies are assumed by the core company all insurance is assumed or written within individual captive cells most captive cells reinsure individual lines of insurance coverage from external insurance companies in addition some captive cells offer individual lines of insurance coverage from one of our insurance company subsidiaries the different types of insurance coverage include special property general liability products liability medical professional liability other liability and medical stop loss the policies are generally claimsmade insurance policies are written by an insurance company and the risk is assumed by each of the captive cells in general we structure these operations to have no underwriting risk on a net written basis in situations where we have assumed underwriting risk on a net written basis we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for the underwriting risk we have assumed from our clients we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to limit our risk 

  

we have a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary based in the us that cedes all of its insurance to reinsurers or captives under facultative and quota share treaty reinsurance agreements these reinsurance arrangements diversify our business and minimize our exposure to losses or hazards of an unusual nature the ceding of insurance does not discharge the original insurer of its primary liability to its policyholder in the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations we would be liable for such defaulted amounts therefore we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers or captives in order to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer credit risk and insolvencies we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for which we typically require pledged assets including cash andor investment accounts or letters of credit to fully offset the risk 

see item 1a “risk factors” for information regarding risks attendant to these foreign operations 

international risk management operations 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the us and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

markets and marketing 

we manage our brokerage operations through a network of more than 570 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 30 other countries we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2015 our largest single customer accounted for approximately 1 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments and our ten largest customers represented 4 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the aggregate our revenues are geographically diversified with both domestic and international operations 

each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small marketshare position and as a result we believe has substantial organic growth potential in addition each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small to mediumsized independent brokerages see “business combinations” below 

while historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically and we expect to continue to do so from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment 

we require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities plus all of our executive officers to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 20 2015 edition we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis towers watson public limited company each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as jardine lloyd thomson group plc wells fargo insurance services inc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients in addition for healthwelfare products and benefit consultant services we compete with larger firms such as aon hewitt mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc willis towers watson public limited company midmarket firms such as lockton usi holdings and wells fargo and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies 

our wholesale brokerage and binding operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc swett  crawford group inc as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers 

we also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

  

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrator based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s march 30 2015 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company esis a subsidiary of ace limited and corvel several large insurance companies such as travelers and zurich insurance also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level we believe that the primary factor determining our competitive position is reputation for outstanding service and the ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most costefficient manner possible 

regulation 

we are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business in addition most jurisdictions require individuals who engage in brokerage claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed these licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in most jurisdictions licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities 

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 383 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2015 almost exclusively within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local propertycasualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas over the last decade we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas the total purchase price for individual acquisitions have typically ranged from 10 million to 500 million although in 2014 we completed three large acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price consideration in excess of 17000 million 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

 item 1a  risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

an overall economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

an overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy our growing operations in countries and regions undergoing economic downturns particularly in emerging markets expose us to risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for insurance companies or reduced insurer capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients and the failure of errors and omissions insurance carriers could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition if carriers merge or if a large carrier fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage overall underwriting capacity could be negatively affected which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commissionbased compensation 

  

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets two of which have revenues significantly larger than ours the third firm willis group holdings ltd recently completed a merger with a large benefits and human resources firm and the new combined firm is significantly larger than we are in addition various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our risk management operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms 

the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefits consulting firms and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth particularly in our brokerage segment and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equitybacked consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically 

postacquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology human resources or organizational culture and fit some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as jiang tai re our joint venture with jiang tai insurance brokers in china or casanueva perez sap de cv grupo cp in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain both new talent and experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers to competitors in the past such departures could lead to the loss of clients and intellectual property the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments or our inability to identify recruit and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our growing operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

we conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the us including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations for example we have operations in india to provide certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations 

our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations 

a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume andor growth thresholds andor insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent commissions andor supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs 

  

our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster cybersecurity attack or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located for example our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services disruptions could be caused by among other things restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics cybersecurity attacks or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies however such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees could damage our reputation any resulting erosion of trust and confidence among existing and potential clients regulators stockholders and other parties important to the success of our business could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data whether due to human error misuse of information by employees or vendors or as a result of cyberattacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information and financial information in many jurisdictions particularly in the us and the european union we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with thirdparty vendors 

we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business in the future these types of incidents could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data compromise confidential business information result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data which could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business cyber threats are constantly evolving which makes it more difficult to detect cybersecurity incidents assess their severity or impact in a timely manner and successfully defend against them 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance it is possible that the steps we follow including our security controls over personal data and training of employees on data security may not prevent improper access to disclosure of or misuse of confidential personal or proprietary information this could cause harm to our reputation create legal exposure or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with thirdparty vendors we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems 

  

data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate for example in 2015 the european court of justice invalidated a key safe harbor relied upon by many businesses to transfer personal data legally from the european union to the us there is a growing body of international data protection law which in part includes security breach notification obligations more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance in addition legislators in the us are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable 

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the securities and exchange commission sec the department of justice doj the internal revenue service irs and the office of foreign assets control ofac in the us the financial conduct authority fca in the uk the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including the development of new internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected 

changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business 

for example the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past fifteen years because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from insurance companies separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental commissions and payments for consulting and analytics services provided to insurance carriers future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these additional revenue streams adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client insurer or other relationships 

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws sanctioned parties restrictions and fatca 

in foreign countries where we operate a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to our compliance program to ensure compliance however we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

  

we remain subject to the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations violations by our company or a third party could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm 

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate us trade sanctions administered by ofac the european union and the united nations and trade sanction laws such as the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 health care reform legislation 

the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns in addition if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory and claims handling services there is also the risk that our employees or subagents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the irs in addition we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we our subsidiary gallagher clean energy llc and chemmod llc are liable for infringement of a patent held by nalco company an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

  

significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

a large and growing portion of our business is located outside the us some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards for example new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments our ability to generate returns and avoid writeoffs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties these include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties set forth below 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals failure of the chemmod™ solution utilized at coalfired generation facilities for example could result in violations of air emissions permits additionally some environmental laws without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chemmod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution for example we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and 

  

precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage diminution of property or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2015 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 25 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates it will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to stockholders acquisitions capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock 

  

further we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the us in the event we are unable to meet these us based cash requirements 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units performance stock units stock appreciation rights options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest our shareholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 

the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors including the risk factors described above many of which are outside our control in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 




 item 2 properties

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” beginning on page 29 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures 

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks we are headquartered in itasca illinois have operations in 30 other countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in 2015 we expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth we generate approximately 68 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 32 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk based on 2015 revenues we expect that our international revenue will continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 given the number and size of the nonus acquisitions that we completed in 2013 2014 and 2015 we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 62 13 and 25 respectively to 2015 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds clean energy and other investments and interest income from premium financing 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

overview and 2015 financial highlights 

we have generated positive organic growth in the last nineteen quarterly periods in both our brokerage and risk management segments we believe our customers are cautiously optimistic about their business prospects 

our operating results improved in 2015 compared to 2014 in both our brokerage and risk management segments 

 

  

  

  

  

   

headquarters relocation  we plan to relocate our headquarters to the city of rolling meadows illinois a suburb of chicago approximately 4 miles from our current location during early 2017 we purchased the property for our new headquarters in february 2014 for approximately 134 million and began redeveloping it in august 2015 we expect that redevelopment and relocation costs could total approximately 145 million offsetting these costs are redevelopment tax incentives from the state of illinois and property tax incentives from the city of rolling meadows which together could total between 600 million and 800 million both the state and city tax credits depend upon our creating and maintaining a minimum number of jobs over certain periods of time we do not anticipate any difficulty meeting these requirements 

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2015 and 2014 revenues ebitdac and diluted net earnings loss per share as stated above comparing 2015 to 2014 results net earnings were up 2 in our brokerage segment 36 in our risk management segment and up 6 for the two segments combined 

 

 we achieved these results by among other things demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy and generating organic growth in our core businesses in 2015 we continued to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth in both 2015 and 2014 32 of our total revenues were generated internationally in our combined brokerage and risk management segments compared with 23 in 2013 we expect international revenues to be approximately the same percentage of total revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments in 2016 

  

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas as markets harden certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

the first quarter 2015 council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab survey indicated that rates retracted modestly by 23 on average across all lines which was in line with the basically flat to slightly lower rate trend noted in the fourth quarter 2014 survey the second quarter 2015 ciab survey indicated that rates retracted by 33 on average across all lines continuing the downward trend from the first quarter 2015 survey the third quarter 2015 ciab survey indicated that rates retracted by 31 on average across all lines continuing the downward trend from the second quarter 2015 survey the fourth quarter 2015 ciab survey indicated that 2015 closed as it began with continued decreases in commercial property casualty rates across small medium and large accounts rates decreased by 28 on average across all lines large accounts experienced a decrease of 37 medium accounts decreased by 30 and small accounts decreased by 15 in 2016 while we see retail propertycasualty rates as a headwind we do see propertycasualty exposure growth offsetting this partially we also see employment growth and complexity surrounding the affordable care act as tailwinds for our employee benefit units in addition our history of strong new business generation solid retentions and enhanced valueadded services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world we believe similar conditions exist as we start the january 1 2016 renewal season internationally we see a similar market in uk retail and in canada but substantially more softening in london specialty australia and new zealand overall we believe a modestlydown rate environment can be partially mitigated through exposure unit growth in certain lines and by our professionals demonstrating our expertise and high quality value added capabilities by strengthening our clients’ insurance portfolio in these times based on our experience insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions in lines and accounts where rate increases or decreases are warranted the underwriters are pricing accordingly as carriers reach their profitability targets in lines rates may start to flatten in summary in this environment rates decreased at a moderate pace clients can still obtain coverage businesses continue to stay in standardline markets and there is adequate capacity in the insurance market it is not clear whether the rate retraction will continue due to the uncertainty of the current economic environment the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

clean energy investments  in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s see below proprietary technologies on september 1 2013 we purchased a 99 interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five clean coal production plants on march 1 2014 we purchased an additional ownership interest in seven of the 2009 era plants and five of the 2011 era plants from a coinvestor for all seven of the 2009 era plants our ownership increased from 495 to 1000 for the 2011 era plants our ownership increased from 488 to 900 for one of the plants from 490 to 1000 for three of the plants and from 980 to 1000 for one of the plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

twentynine plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities the remaining five plants are in various stages of seeking and negotiating longterm production contracts 

  

we also own a 465 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chemmod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 40 million to 50 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

our current estimate of the 2016 annual aftertax earnings that could be generated from all of our clean energy investments in 2016 is between 1100 million to 1240 million if we continue to have success entering into additional longterm production contracts we estimate that we could generate more aftertax earnings in 2017 and beyond 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts typically we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of propertycasualty insurance policy transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit brokerage operations under these direct bill arrangements the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions that we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services that we provide over a period of time typically one year we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board which we refer to as the fasb issued new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts with customers which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the new accounting guidance 

income taxes  our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return we evaluate our tax positions using a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position if a tax position does not meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

  

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses our primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements or trade names expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and five to fifteen years for trade names while goodwill is not subject to amortization the establishment of goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods different estimates or assumptions could produce different results we carry intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 

we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2015 2014 and 2013 we wrote off 115 million 18 million and 22 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets primarily related to prior year acquisitions in our brokerage segment the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 

  

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections that are developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2015 business combinations

results of operations 

information regarding nongaap measures and other 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information related to organic revenues and ebitdac although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided certain reclassifications have been made to the prioryear amounts reported in this report in order to conform them to the current year presentation 

adjusted presentation  we believe that the adjusted presentation of our 2015 2014 and 2013 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

   

earnings measures  we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segment each as defined below provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability 

 

  

  

  

  

 organic revenues  for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition change in base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the impact of supplemental and contingent commission revenues and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation and disposed of operations the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same prior year periods for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the impact of south australian ramp up fees and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2016 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this measure allows financial statement users to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 

reconciliation of nongaap information presented to gaap measures  this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted and organic revenue measures 

segment reclassification  in first quarter 2015 we transferred management of a claims handling operation from the brokerage segment to the risk management segment total revenues related to this operation were 196 million 180 million and 180 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we made the applicable segment reclassifications to the priorperiod amounts to conform to the currentperiod presentation the changes in the segment structure affect only the manner in which the results for the reportable segments were previously reported these reclassifications did not impact our previously reported consolidated net earnings see note 1 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for an additional discussion on the reclassification of amounts between the brokerage and risk management segments 

  

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 62 of our revenue in 2015 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

litigation and regulatory matters  during january and february 2015 five senior employees of our ukbased international brokerage operation including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer resigned from the company and disclosed that they intended to work for another insurance brokerage firm in april 2015 we commenced litigation against the former chief executive officer the former chief financial officer and a thirdparty financial advisor among other things the litigation sought damages for breach of fiduciary duty breach of contract and taking of corporate opportunities on august 26 2015 we announced that we had settled the litigation for total payments to us of approximately £200 million or 310 million in addition certain of the former executives agreed to repay employee loans and retention awards totaling approximately £20 million or 31 million 

a portion of our brokerage business includes the development and management of “microcaptives” through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of tribeca strategic advisors tribeca a “captive” is an insurance company that insures the risks of its owner affiliates or a group of companies microcaptives are captive insurance companies that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under irc section 831b our microcaptive advisory services are under investigation by the internal revenue service irs additionally the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the microcaptive insurance companies organized andor managed by us among other matters the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations while the irs has not made specific allegations relating to our operations or the preacquisition activities of tribeca if the irs were to successfully assert that the microcaptives organized andor managed by us do not meet the requirements of irc section 831b we could be subject to monetary claims by the irs andor our microcaptive clients and our future earnings from our microcaptive operations could be materially adversely affected any of which event could negatively impact the overall captive business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition we may also experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended irs investigation on our clients’ and potential clients’ businesses annual renewals for microcaptive clients generally occur during the fourth quarter therefore any negative impact from this investigation would likely have a disproportionate impact on fourthquarter results in 2015 and 2014 our microcaptive operations contributed approximately 39 million and 50 million respectively in ebitdac and 19 million and 25 million respectively in net earnings to our consolidated results due to the fact that the irs is still completing its investigation and has not made any allegation against us we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation 

  

financial information relating to our brokerage segment results for 2015 2014 and 2013 in millions except per share percentages and workforce data 

 

   

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2015 and 2014 ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac and 2014 and 2013 ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac in millions 

 

 acquisition integration costs include costs related to our july 2 2014 acquisition of noraxis capital corporation which we refer to as noraxis our june 16 2014 acquisition of crombieoamps which we refer to as crombieoamps our april 1 2014 acquisition of oval group of companies which we refer to as oval our november 14 2013 acquisition of giles group of companies which we refer to as giles our august 12 2013 acquisition of bollinger inc which we refer to as bollinger and our may 12 2011 acquisition of hlg holdings ltd which we refer to as heath lambert that are not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate these acquisitions these costs relate to onboarding of employees communication system conversion costs related performance compensation redundant workforce extra lease space duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquired businesses with our it related systems the noraxis integration costs in 2015 totaled 74 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices technology costs and incentive compensation the crombieoamps integration costs in 2015 totaled 234 million and were primarily related to technology costs and incentive compensation the giles and oval integration costs in 2015 totaled 690 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the uk technology costs branding and incentive compensation the giles and oval integration costs in 2014 totaled 371 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the uk technology costs the onboarding of over 2000 employees and incentive compensation the bollinger integration costs in 2014 totaled 107 million and were primarily related to technology costs the onboarding of over 500 employees and incentive compensation the full integration of the bollinger operations into our existing operations was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 the crombieoamps integration costs in 2014 totaled 165 million and were primarily related to technology costs the onboarding of over 1700 employees and incentive compensation the noraxis integration costs in 2014 totaled 28 million and were primarily related the onboarding of over 650 employees the full integration of the heath lambert operations into our existing operations was completed in the third quarter of 2013 integration costs related to these acquisitions for the full year in 2016 are estimated to be less than half of what they were in 2015

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recognized 162 million 145 million and 119 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2015 2014 and 2013 acquisitions during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recognized 249 million 31 million of expense and 93 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 103 67 and 77 acquisitions respectively 

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2011 to 2015 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income

financial information relating to our corporate segment results for 2015 2014 and 2013 in millions except per share and percentages 

 

 revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

 the increases in 2015 and 2014 are due to increased production at both the leased facilities and facilities in which we have a majority ownership position including the impact of the facilities we consolidated in 2014 and 2013 

  

 the increases in royalty income in 2015 compared to 2014 and in 2014 compared to 2013 were due to increased production of refined coal by chemmod’s licensees 

expenses related to royalty income of chemmod were 30 million 31 million and 21 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively these expenses are included in the operating expenses discussed below 

 

 the losses in 2015 2014 and 2013 were low because the vast majority of our operations are now consolidated 

 

 cost of revenues  cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2015 2014 and 2013 consists of the cost of coal labor equipment maintenance chemicals supplies management fees and depreciation incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above including the costs to run the leased facilities 

compensation expense  compensation expense for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively includes salary retention agreement compensation 2015 only and benefit expenses of 278 million 207 million and 114 million and incentive compensation of 342 million 296 million and 127 million respectively 

the increase in salary and benefit expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to retention agreement compensation related to the litigation settlement salary related to corporate staff working outside the us offset by the reduction in expense related to the 2014 derisking strategy of our us defined pension plan 

the increase in salary and benefit expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a 120 million charge related to the derisking strategy of our us defined benefit plan offset by a reduction in pension expense of 36 million in the period from september 12 2014 to november 30 2014 we offered a onetime voluntary lump sum window to eligible deferred vested participants in our us defined benefit plan in an effort to reduce our longterm pension obligations and the volatility of these obligations on our balance sheet the aggregate lump sum payout made in fourth quarter 2014 was 433 million this lump sum payout project reduced the plan’s pension benefit obligation by approximately 600 million while improving its pension underfunding by almost 170 million as of december 31 2015 due to this significant obligation settlement we incurred a noncash pretax charge of approximately 120 million in fourth quarter 2014 as a result of the us gaap requirement to expense the portion of the unrealized actuarial losses currently recognized as accumulated other comprehensive loss based on a ratio of the liability settled to the total liability within the plan at december 31 2014 

the increase in incentive compensation in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to clean energy performance 

the increase in incentive compensation in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to the efforts in 2014 related to the transaction for the additional interests in the twelve clean coal plants the work on corporate related matters including the 2014 debt and secondary stock offering transactions and the level of acquisition activity in 2014 

  

operating expense  operating expense for 2015 includes banking and related fees of 27 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2015 acquisitions of 37 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 99 million and 38 million for a biennial corporatewide meeting and 17 million related to the litigation settlement

interest expense  the increase in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013 was due to the following 

 

 the capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new corporate headquarters building will occur until the development of it is completed which is estimated to be done in early 2017 

depreciation  the increase in depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 and in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily relates to the assets of the additional ownership interests in the plants that we acquired from coinvestors in first quarters of 2013 and 2014 

benefit for income taxes  we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our twenty 2011 era plants our consolidated effective tax rate was 326 123 and 22 for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the tax rates for 2015 2014 and 2013 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year there were 1813 million 1455 million and 937 million of tax credits produced and recognized in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests  the amounts reported in this line for 2015 2014 and 2013 primarily include noncontrolling interest earnings of 369 million 353 million and 192 million respectively related to the nongallagher owned interest in chemmod llc as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we held a 465 controlling interest in chemmod also included in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are offsetting amounts related to nongallagher owned interests in several clean energy investments 

  

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2015 2014 and 2013 operating results for the corporate segment in millions 

 

  

    interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt clean energy investments include the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production plants and chemmod acquisition costs include professional fees due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions in 2013 acquisition costs include a gain of 26 million on the derivative investment contract discussed above corporate consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation costs related to biennial companywide award crossselling and motivational meetings for our production staff and field management and in 2015 retention agreement compensation related to the litigation settlement 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the fourteen plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the twenty plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

  

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2015 in millions 

 

 the information in the table above under the caption ultimate annual aftertax earnings reflects management’s current best estimate of the ultimate future potential annual aftertax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities and preliminary investment partner assumptions it is unlikely we will fully achieve these earnings in 2016 as the cleancoal production plants are forecasted to start or resume production at various dates throughout 2016 further host utilities do not consistently utilize the fuel plants at ultimate production levels due to seasonal electricity demand as well as many other operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons achieving these ultimate estimates in 2017 may be possible assuming successful progress in 2016 in both plant deployments and recruitment of investment partners to purchase portions of our section 45 portfolio 

our investment in chemmod generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties based on current production estimates provided by licensees we believe chemmod could generate for us an average of approximately 40 million to 50 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to coinvestors and relinquish control of the plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling minority investor the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control as of any date we become a noncontrolling minority investor we deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting 

for all plants that are not under longterm production contracts we estimate that we will invest on average an additional 70 million per plant to connect and house each of them for those plants that will have majority ownership coinvestors the average additional investment will be 35 million we currently have 22 million of commitments related to our refined coal plants additionally we further estimate that we could invest approximately 400 million to redeploy the remainder of the refined coal plants in 2016 and into 2017 before any coinvestor contributions 

we are aware that some of the coalfired power plants that purchase the refined coal are considering changing to burning natural gas rather than coal or shutting down completely for economic reasons the entities that own such plants are prepared to move the refined coal plants to other generally higher volume coalfired power plants if necessary if these potential developments were to occur we estimate those plants will not operate for 12 to18 months during their movement and redeployment which could have a material impact on the amount of tax credits that are generated by these plants 

  

there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 

  

 see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2015 2014 and 2013 we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes plus a secondary public offering of our common stock in april 2014 whereby 2185 million shares of our stock were issued for net proceeds after underwriting discounts and other expenses related to this offering of 9114 million 

cash provided by operating activities was 6526 million 4366 million and 3725 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2015 compared to 2014 partially offset by cash used in 2015 in the production and sale of refined coal at the plants qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 in addition cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was adversely impacted by an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of 1544 million compared to an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of 1415 million in 2014 and an increase in acquisition related integration costs in 2015 also negatively impacting cash provided by operating activities between 2015 and 2014 was cash payments related to compensationbased retention agreements during second quarter 2015 we entered into compensationbased retention agreements with certain key employees of our international brokerage operations we estimate that these retention agreements will add aftertax charges of approximately 45 million per quarter through june 30 2017 to our compensation expense the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2014 compared to 2013 partially offset by cash used in 2014 in the production and sale of refined coal at the plants qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 in addition cash provided by operating activities for 2014 was adversely impacted by an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of 1415 million compared to an unrealized foreign currency measurement gain of 95 million in 2013 our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted by the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized compared to the amount of tax credits actually used during the respective periods excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities 

  

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 7713 million and 6569 million for 2015 and 2014 respectively net earnings attributable to controlling interests were 3568 million and 3034 million we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2015 and 2014 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2015 and 2014 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan during 2013 we made discretionary contributions to the plan of 63 million we are not considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2016 but may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the plan in future periods 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in august 2014 we decided to pursue a pension derisking strategy to reduce the size of our longterm us defined benefit pension plan obligations and the volatility of these obligations on our balance sheet on september 12 2014 the fiduciaries of the plan began offering certain former employees who were participants in the plan the option of receiving the value of their pension benefit in a lump sum payment or as an accelerated reduced annuity in lieu of monthly annuity payments when they retire the voluntary offer was made to approximately 2500 terminated vested participants in the plan whose employment terminated with the company prior to august 1 2014 and who had not commenced benefit payments as of november 1 2014 eligible participants had from september 12 2014 to november 30 2014 to accept the offer and the lumpsum payments were made in november and december of 2014 and the accelerated reduced annuity payments began as of december 1 2014 the aggregate lump sum payout made in fourth quarter 2014 was 433 million all payouts related to this offer were made using assets from the plan this lump sum payout project reduced the plan’s pension benefit obligation by approximately 600 million while improving its pension underfunding by almost 170 million as of december 31 2014 due to this significant obligation settlement we incurred a noncash pretax charge of approximately 120 million in fourth quarter 2014 as a result of the us gaap requirement to expense the portion of the unrealized actuarial losses currently recognized as accumulated other comprehensive loss based on a ratio of the liability settled to the total liability within the plan at december 31 2014 

in 2015 the funded status of the plans was favorably impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2015 the impact of which was approximately 140 million however the funded status was unfavorably impacted by returns on the plan’s assets being significantly less in 2015 than anticipated by approximately 130 million the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2015 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2015 of 05 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2015 2014 and 2013 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 990 million 815 million and 936 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in 2016 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 2250 million primarily related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building approximately 1030 million office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters we expect to receive property tax related credits under a taxincrement financing note from rolling meadows illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit incentives from these two programs could total up to 600 million and 800 million over a fifteenyear period the net capital expenditures in 2015 2014 and 2013 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in 2015 an office move and expansion in the uk in 2013 and the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2015 2014 and 2013 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 3423 million 19183 million and 7277 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions that occurred in 2015 the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to three large acquisitions that occurred in 2014 in addition during 2015 2014 and 2013 we issued 73 million shares 3389 million 65 million shares 2928 million and 52 million shares 2270 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 44 60 and 31 acquisitions in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2015 2014 and 2013 totaled approximately 2308 million 7612 million and 3839 million respectively in 2016 we expect to use our debt cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete 

dispositions  during 2015 2014 and 2013 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 67 million 73 million and 52 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 92 million 82 million and 55 million respectively related to these transactions 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2015 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate of the 2016 annual aftertax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments is 1100 million to 1240 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants by capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2016 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time nonetheless if current ownership interests remain the same if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remain at current levels and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2015 through 2021 while we cannot accurately forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see “clean energy investments” on pages 45 and 47 for a more detailed description of these investments including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties 

cash flows from financing activities 

on september 19 2013 we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on september 19 2018 with a group of fifteen financial institutions the credit agreement replaced a 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on july 14 2014 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement all indebtedness liabilities and obligations outstanding under the previous facility were fully paid and satisfied except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 

our credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to 6000 million of which up to 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 500 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 8500 million 

we have a secured revolving loan facility which we refer to as the premium financing debt facility that provides funding for the three australian au and new zealand nz premium finance subsidiaries that we acquired on june 16 2014 the premium financing debt facility is comprised of i facility b with separate au1500 million and nz350 million tranches ii facility c is an au250 million equivalent multicurrency overdraft tranche and iii facility d is a nz150 million equivalent multicurrency overdraft tranche the premium financing debt facility expires may 18 2017 at december 31 2015 1370 million of borrowings were outstanding under the premium financing debt facility 

we use the premium financing debt facility to borrow funds from time to time to fund the premium financing activities of three of our australian au and new zealand nz subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014 we had net borrowings of 239 million and 1279 million respectively on the premium financing debt facility of which 1129 million in 2014 were used to pay down a facility that crombieoamps had with its former owner 

  

at december 31 2015 we had 23200 million of corporaterelated borrowings outstanding and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 4804 million we also use our credit agreement from time to time to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement there were 1950 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2015 due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit 3835 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2015 

during 2015 we borrowed an aggregate of 8490 million and repaid 7940 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2015 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2014 we borrowed an aggregate of 11099 million and repaid 15004 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2014 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2013 we borrowed an aggregate of 8905 million and repaid 4890 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2013 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes 

we anticipate raising an additional 200 million to 300 million of debt late in second quarter 2016 

the note purchase agreements the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2015 

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2015 we declared 2583 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 148 per common share on december 18 2015 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 37 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 4 2015 on january 28 2016 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2016 of 38 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 38 per common share throughout 2016 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2016 of approximately 2687 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2015 or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately 112 million compared to 2015 we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors we did not repurchase any shares in 2015 2014 and 2013 under the provisions of the repurchase plan we were authorized to repurchase approximately 10000000 additional shares at december 31 2015 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources there were no common stock repurchases made in 2015 2014 or 2013 that impacted our consolidated financial statements 

atthemarket equity program  on november 20 2013 we entered into an equity distribution agreement with morgan stanley  co llc pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to 200 million of which 156 million is remaining of our common stock through morgan stanley as sales agent pursuant to the agreement shares may be sold by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions including on the new york stock exchange at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices in block transactions or as otherwise agreed upon by us and morgan stanley 

during the quarter ended december 31 2015 we did not sell any shares of our common stock under the program during the year ended december 31 2015 we sold 3118807 shares of our common stock under the program at a weighted average price of 4833 per share resulting in net proceeds after sales commissions of approximately 15 million to morgan stanley of approximately 1492 million 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 541 million in 2015 563 million in 2014 and 762 million in 2013 

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 7 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2015 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation outstanding purchase commitments in the table above include 816 million related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 157 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2015 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date in addition funding commitments in the table above includes 314 million related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 383 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2012 to 2015 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 5654 million of which 2297 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made 

  

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2015 and 2014 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2015 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 97 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 118 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2015 we had posted seven letters of credit totaling 63 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity one letter of credit totaling 50 million to support our potential obligation under a client’s insurance program and one letter of credit totaling 05 million as a security deposit for a third quarter 2015 acquisition’s lease these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2015 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and our cash equivalents as of december 31 2015 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2015 

as of december 31 2015 we had 21250 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2015 was 22196 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purposes of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us based on our current estimated credit rating 

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2015 and the resulting fair values would be 2259 million higher than their carrying value or 23509 million we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2015 and the resulting fair values would be 269 million lower than their carrying value or 20981 million 

as of december 31 2015 we had 1950 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2015 and the resulting fair value is not be materially different from their carrying value 

  

at december 31 2015 we had 1370 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2015 and the resulting fair value is not materially different from their carrying value 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2015 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 147 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2015 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 168 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss 

historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india norway and the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2015 2014 and 2013 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues in 2015 and disbursements in 2014 through various future payment dates in addition during 2015 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2015 2014 and 2013 see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2015 2014 and 2013 we entered into an au4000 million foreign currency derivative investment contract that we executed on april 16 2014 in connection with the signing of the agreement to acquire the crombieoamps operations this contract was designed to hedge a portion of the au dollar denominated purchase price consideration of this acquisition the derivative investment contract was exercised on june 16 2014 the date that the crombieoamps transaction closed in second quarter 2014 we recorded a pretax gain of 19 million related to this derivative investment contract in 2013 we entered into three foreign currency derivative investment contracts in connection with the signing of an agreement to acquire the giles group of companies headquartered in london england these contracts were designed to hedge a portion of the gbp denominated purchase price consideration of this acquisition in 2013 we recorded a pretax gain of 26 million related to these derivative investment contracts in the future we expect to continue hedging these types of transactions and other currencies as needed

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations information with respect to all sources of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014 is as follows in millions 

 

 see note 18 to our 2014 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information including earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2014 2013 and 2012 

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commission and fee revenues and the related brokerage and marketing expenses can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers on the other hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of irc section 45 tax credits also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 17 to our 2014 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2014 and 2013 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 63 of our revenues in 2014 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and healthcare exchange and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon either a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

we operate our brokerage operations through a network of more than 550 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 29 other countries most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel in addition we offer clientservice capabilities in approximately 140 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 

  

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 83 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2014 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows 

 

 our retail brokerage operations are organized in more than 500 geographical profit centers primarily located in the us australia canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 69 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups we serve are as follows 

 

 our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries or business segments we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

 

  

  

  

 wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 17 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2014 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance these brokers operate through more than 65 geographical profit centers located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer’s business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

more than 80 of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as the largest domestic managing general agentunderwriting manager according to business insurance magazine’s september 15 2014 edition 

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

  

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 14 of our revenues in 2014 our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments approximately 71 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers compensation related claims 25 are from general and commercial auto liability related claims and 4 are from property related claims in addition we generate revenues from integrated disability management employee absence management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed 

risk management services are primarily marketed directly to fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies notforprofit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients and customers 

while this segment complements our insurance brokerage offerings more than 90 of our risk management segment’s revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers such as insurance companies and clients of other insurance brokers based on revenues our risk management operation ranked as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrator according to business insurance magazine’s march 31 2014 edition 

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from 

 

  

  

  

 corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 23 of our revenues in 2014 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate costs the revenues reported by this segment in 2014 resulted primarily from our consolidation of refined fuel operations that we control and own more than 50 of and from leased facilities we operate and control at december 31 2014 significant investments managed by this segment include 

clean coal related ventures 

we have a 4654 interest in chemmod llc chemmod a privatelyheld enterprise that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we also have a 120 interest in a privatelyheld startup enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels 

taxadvantaged investments 

prior to january 1 2008 we owned certain partnerships formed to develop energy that qualified for tax credits under the former irc section 29 these consisted of wastetoenergy and synthetic coal operations these investments helped to substantially reduce our effective income tax rate from 2002 through 2007 the law that permitted us to claim irc section 29 tax credits expired on december 31 2007 in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s proprietary technologies and in 2013 we purchased a 99 interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five commercial clean coal production plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

  

international operations 

our total revenues by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014 were as follows in millions 

 

 see notes 6 15 and 18 to our 2014 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2014 2013 and 2012 

international brokerage operations 

the majority of our international brokerage operations are in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk targeting small to medium enterprise risks 

we operate primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker throughout more than 35 locations in australia 30 locations in canada and 25 locations in new zealand in the uk we operate as a retail broker from more than 55 locations we also have an underwriting operation for clients to access the lloyd’s of london and other international insurance markets and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities 

in bermuda we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies we also have ownership interests in two bermudabased insurance companies and a guernseybased insurance company that operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these facilities enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive insurance companies are created for clients to insure their risks and capture underwriting profit and investment income which is then available for use by the insureds generally for reducing future costs of their insurance programs 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in approximately 140 countries we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area 

international risk management operations 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the us and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

markets and marketing 

we manage our brokerage operations through a network of more than 550 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 29 other countries we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2014 our largest single customer accounted for approximately 1 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments and our ten largest customers represented 4 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the aggregate our revenues are geographically diversified with both domestic and international operations 

each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small marketshare position and as a result we believe has substantial organic growth potential in addition each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small to mediumsized independent brokerages see “business combinations” below 

  

while historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically and we expect to continue to do so from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment 

we require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities plus all of our executive officers to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 21 2014 edition we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis group holdings ltd each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as jardine lloyd thomson group plc wells fargo insurance services inc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients in addition for healthwelfare products and benefit consultant services we compete with larger firms such as aon hewitt mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc towers watson  co midmarket firms such as lockton usi holdings and wells fargo and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies 

our wholesale brokerage operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc swett  crawford group inc as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers 

we also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrator based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s march 31 2014 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company and esis a subsidiary of ace limited several large insurance companies such as travelers and zurich insurance also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level we believe that our competitive position is due to our strong reputation for outstanding service and our ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most costefficient manner possible 

regulation 

we are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business in addition most jurisdictions require individuals who engage in brokerage claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed these licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in most jurisdictions licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities 

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 339 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2014 almost exclusively within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local propertycasualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas over the last decade we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas the total purchase price for individual acquisitions have typically ranged from 10 million to 500 million although in 2014 we completed three large acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price consideration in excess of 17000 million 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

 item 1a  risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

an overall economic downturn as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

an overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our growing operations in countries and regions undergoing economic downturns particularly in emerging markets expose us to risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition the market instability caused by the eurozone debt crisis has led to questions regarding the future viability of the euro as a single currency for the region the exit of greece or another country from the eurozone or the dissolution of the euro in the extreme case could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our results of operations in addition the value of our assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings would decline if currencies in the region were devalued 

economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for insurance companies or reduced insurer capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients and the failure of errors and omissions insurance carriers could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions because of market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

  

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commissionbased compensation 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our risk management operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms 

we believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefits consulting firms and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

historically we have acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefits consulting firms and risk management firms our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equitybacked consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically 

postacquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel retention of clients entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and uk bribery act risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements tax and accounting issues the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology human resources or organizational culture and fit some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth postacquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

  

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as jiang tai re our joint venture with jiang tai insurance brokers in china or casanueva perez sap de cv grupo cp in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers to competitors in the past for example the leader of our brokerage operations in the uk as well as the finance leader of those operations recently left us the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our growing operations outside the us expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

we conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the us including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations for example we have operations in india to provide certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations 

our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risk that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations 

a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume andor growth thresholds andor insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent commissions andor supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our 

  

business requires us to incur significant expenses for example certain of our competitors have launched consulting operations that leverage global insurance placement data if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results client relationships growth and compliance programs 

our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster cybersecurity attack or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located for example our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services disruptions could be caused by among other things restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics cybersecurity attacks or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies however such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation actual or alleged conduct by us including unethical actions by “rogue” brokers operations regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct this damage to our reputation could further affect the confidence of our clients regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business having a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or we may be less profitable 

many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision including insurance industry regulation and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the securities and exchange commission sec department of justice doj and internal revenue service irs in the us the financial conduct authority fca in the uk and the australian securities and investments commission in australia our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing licensing data privacy wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including the development of new internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business that we are operating our business in a compliant manner or that our rights are otherwise protected 

changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business for example we offer captive design and management services and group captive development services 

  

and expect to be able to continue offering such services the national association of insurance commissioners naic has established a subgroup to study the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and make recommendations in relation to existing state laws and regulations any action by federal state or other regulators that adversely affects our ability to offer services in relation to captives either retroactively or prospectively could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past decade because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees we receive additional revenue from insurance companies separate from retail commissions and fees including among other things contingent and supplemental commissions and payments for consulting and analytics services provided to insurance carriers future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these additional revenue streams adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client insurer or other relationships 

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations including the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws sanctioned parties restrictions and fatca 

in foreign countries where we operate a risk exists that our employees third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act such anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to our compliance program to ensure compliance however we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and in certain circumstances local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anticorruption laws in addition in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the us and the uk for improper payments to foreign officials these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements 

we remain subject to the risk that our employees third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations violations by our company or a third party could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees civil and criminal penalties including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm 

we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate us trade sanctions on countries such as iran north korea cuba sudan and syria 

in addition fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 health care reform legislation 

the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns in addition if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

  

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or provide clients with appropriate consulting advisory and claims handling services there is also the risk that our employees or subagents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or other extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to the nature of our business and our clean energy investments including but not limited to matters related to employment practices alleged breaches of noncompete or other restrictive covenants theft of trade secrets breaches of fiduciary duties intellectual property infringement and related causes of action we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business for example our microcaptive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the irs in addition we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we our subsidiary gallagher clean energy llc and chemmod llc are liable for infringement of a patent held by nalco company an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period or on an ongoing basis in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs any such matter could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services we may face additional costs loss of profit opportunities and damage to our reputation 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality brokerage and risk management services so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to their needs if a client is not satisfied with our services it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups andor trade associations and actively share information amongst themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients 

the nature of much of our work especially our actuarial services in our benefits consulting business involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance similarly in our institutional investment consulting and our retirement services consulting businesses we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data whether due to human error misuse of information by employees or vendors or as a result of cyberattacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information and financial information in many jurisdictions particularly in the us and the european union we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with thirdparty vendors 

we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business in the future these types of incidents could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to 

  

provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data compromise confidential business information result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data which could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business cyber threats are constantly evolving which makes it more difficult to detect them to assess their severity or impact in a timely manner and to successfully defend against them 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance it is possible that the steps we follow including our security controls over personal data and training of employees on data security may not prevent improper access to disclosure of or misuse of confidential personal or proprietary information this could cause harm to our reputation create legal exposure or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with thirdparty vendors we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate there is a growing body of international data protection law which in part includes security breach notification obligations more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance in addition legislators in the us are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace 

significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

a large and growing portion of our business is located outside the us some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards for example new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

  

see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments our ability to generate returns and avoid writeoffs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties these include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties as set forth below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals such laws and regulations also impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise involved in the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using the chemmod™ solution in a number of ways including air emissions waste water and byproducts such as fly ash one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chemmod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution for example we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage diminution of property or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2014 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 24 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time debt matures our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control such as an environment of rising interest rates it will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to 

  

stockholders acquisitions capital expenditures share repurchases and general corporate purposes if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

we are organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock 

further we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries outside the us 

funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the us may be repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings where necessary a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock moreover to the extent that we issue restricted stock units stock appreciation rights options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest our shareholders may experience further dilution holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and therefore such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 

the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside our control in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock among the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” beginning on page 29 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures 

  

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks we are headquartered in itasca illinois have operations in 30 countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 140 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in 2014 we expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth we generate approximately 68 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 32 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean new zealand and the uk based on 2014 revenues we expect that our international revenue will continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 given the number and size of the nonus acquisitions that we completed in the latter part of 2013 and in 2014 we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 63 14 and 23 respectively to 2014 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds clean energy and other investments and interest income from premium financing 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

overview and 2014 financial highlights 

we have generated positive organic growth in the last sixteen quarterly periods in both our brokerage and risk management segments we believe our customers are increasingly optimistic about their business prospects the first quarter 2014 council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab survey indicated that rates were up on average 15 across all sized accounts the second quarter 2014 ciab survey indicated that rates were down on average 05 across all sized accounts the third quarter 2014 ciab survey indicated that rates were virtually flat with rates up on average 01 across all sized accounts the fourth quarter 2014 ciab survey indicated that rates on average declined by 07 across all sized accounts large accounts experienced a decrease of 22 and medium accounts decreased by 09 most of the brokers surveyed reported no significant changes in the market however results varied somewhat by line region and client loss experience competition was a factor in keeping rates down in the fourth quarter rates were generally steady throughout 2014 as insurance carriers remained disciplined in their underwriting standards the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 85 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

our operating results improved in 2014 compared to 2013 in both our brokerage and risk management segments 

 

  

  

  

  

 on april 1 2014 we acquired the oval group of companies which we refer to as oval under the acquisition agreement we agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity of oval for net cash consideration of approximately 3380 million oval is a commercial insurance broker operating out of 24 offices throughout the uk with over 1000 employees oval generated nearly £870 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 

  

on june 16 2014 we acquired the crombieoamps operations which we refer to as crombieoamps the crombieoamps transaction includes the oamps businesses in australia and the uk crombie in new zealand and the associated premium funding operations under the acquisition agreement we purchased all of the outstanding shares of three operating companies for net cash consideration of approximately 9520 million plus an additional 353 million on october 14 2014 related to a trueup of the excess of net current assets based on the final acquisition date balance sheet over the target amount set forth in the acquisition agreement the crombieoamps operations generated approximately au3450 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 and have approximately 1700 employees operating out of more than 50 offices across australia new zealand and the uk we financed the crombieoamps transaction primarily from a secondary offering of 2185 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 9114 million as described in greater detail in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

on july 2 2014 we acquired noraxis capital corporation which we refer to as noraxis paying cash consideration of approximately 4200 million for approximately 89 of the equity of noraxis the remaining equity is held by various management employees of noraxis noraxis generated nearly cn1250 million in revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 and has more than 650 employees in offices across alberta manitoba new brunswick nova scotia and ontario we financed the acquisition using mostly additional longterm borrowings and borrowings on our line of credit 

total revenues recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for 2014 related to these three large 2014 acquisitions in the aggregate were 3285 million 

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2014 and 2013 revenues ebitdac and diluted net earnings loss per share 

 

   

we achieved these results by among other things demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy and generating organic growth in our core businesses in 2014 we continued to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth by the end of 2014 32 of our revenues were generated internationally in our combined brokerage and risk management segments compared with 23 in 2013 we expect this international revenue trend to continue in 2015 

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 

as markets harden certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

recent events 

in 2014 the insurance market continued to show signs of “firming” as opposed to traditional “hardening” across many lines and geographic areas in this environment rates increased at a moderate pace clients could still obtain coverage businesses continued to stay in standardline markets and there was adequate capacity in the insurance market it is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the current economic environment 

clean energy investments  in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s see below proprietary technologies on september 1 2013 we purchased a 99 interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five clean coal production plants on march 1 2014 we purchased an additional ownership interest in seven of the 2009 era plants and five of the 2011 era plants from a coinvestor for all seven of the 2009 era plants our ownership increased from 495 to 1000 for the 2011 era plants our ownership increased from 488 to 900 for one of the plants from 490 to 1000 for three of the plants and from 980 to 1000 for one of the plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

twentysix plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities the remaining eight plants are in various stages of seeking and negotiating longterm production contracts several of the remaining eight plants could be in production starting in late 2015 

we also own a 4654 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chemmod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 40 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

our current estimate of the 2015 annual aftertax earnings that could be generated from all of our clean energy investments in 2015 is between 900 million to 1100 million if we continue to have success entering into additional longterm production contracts we estimate that we could generate more aftertax earnings in 2016 and beyond

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts typically we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of propertycasualty insurance policy transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit brokerage operations under these direct bill arrangements the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions that we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services that we provide over a period of time typically one year we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 

income taxes  our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return we evaluate our tax positions using a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position if a tax position does not meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

  

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses our primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements or trade names expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and five to fifteen years for trade names while goodwill is not subject to amortization the establishment of goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods different estimates or assumptions could produce different results we carry intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 

we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2014 2013 and 2012 we wrote off 18 million 22 million and 35 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets primarily related to prior year acquisitions in our brokerage segment the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections that are developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2014 business combinations 

business combinations and dispositions 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2014 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2014 2013 and 2012 historically we have used acquisitions to grow our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries we expect that our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow as a result of acquisitions we intend to continue to consider from time to time additional acquisitions for our brokerage and risk management segments on terms that we deem advantageous at any particular time we are generally engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates however we can make no assurances that any additional acquisitions will be consummated or if consummated that they will be advantageous to us 

  

results of operations 

information regarding nongaap measures and other 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information related to organic revenues and ebitdac although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided certain reclassifications have been made to the prioryear amounts reported in this report in order to conform them to the current year presentation 

adjusted presentation  we believe that the adjusted presentation of our 2014 2013 and 2012 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

 earnings measures  we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segment each as defined below provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability 

 

  

  

  

  

 organic revenues  for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition change in base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the impact of supplemental and contingent commission revenues and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation and disposed of operations the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same prior year periods for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the fee revenues 

  

related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the impact of south australian ramp up fees and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2015 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this measure allows financial statement users to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 

reconciliation of nongaap information presented to gaap measures  this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted and organic revenue measures 

other information 

allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue headcount and other information we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our twenty 2011 era plants we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 350 to 370 in both our brokerage segment and our risk management segment for the foreseeable future reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results pretax profit margin compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings divided by total revenues the compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues the operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 63 of our revenue in 2014 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

within our retail brokerage operations one area of growth in recent years has been organizing and managing “captives” and other vehicles for selfinsurance a “captive” is an insurance company that insures the risks of its owner affiliates or a group of companies a portion of our captive business includes the development and management of “microcaptives” through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of tribeca strategic advisors tribeca microcaptives are captive insurance companies that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under irc section 831b our microcaptive advisory services are the subject of an investigation by the internal revenue service irs additionally the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the microcaptive insurance companies organized andor managed by us among other matters the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations while the irs has not made any specific allegations relating to our operations or the preacquisition activities of tribeca if the irs were to successfully assert that the microcaptives organized andor managed by us do not meet the requirements of irc section 831b we could be subject to monetary claims by the irs andor our microcaptive clients and our future earnings from our microcaptive operations could be materially adversely affected any of which could negatively impact the overall captive business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition even if the irs were to conclude that the micro 

  

captives have been operated in accordance with applicable law we may still experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended irs investigation on our clients’ and potential clients’ businesses annual renewals for microcaptive clients generally occur during the fourth quarter therefore any negative impact from this investigation would likely have a disproportionate impact on fourthquarter results in 2014 and 2013 our microcaptive operations contributed approximately 50 million and 63 million respectively in ebitdac and 25 million and 33 million respectively in net earnings to our consolidated results due to the early stage of the investigation and the fact that the irs has not made any allegation against us at this time we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation

the reported investment income and gains realized on books of business sales for 2014 include premium financing income primarily generated by the crombieoamps operations which were acquired on june 16 2014 operating results of the crombieoamps premium financing business recognized by us in 2014 are as follows in millions 

 

 compensation expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2014 and 2013 compensation expense and 2013 and 2012 compensation expense in millions 

 

 the increase in compensation expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 3738 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 439 million stock compensation expense 43 million deferred compensation 19 million and temporary staffing 17 million offset by a decrease in severance related costs 03 million the increase in employee headcount in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2014 and new production hires 

the increase in compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1321 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 217 million deferred compensation 84 million stock compensation expense 16 million and temporary staffing 09 million offset by a decrease in severance related costs 59 million the increase in employee headcount in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2013 and new production hires 

operating expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2014 and 2013 operating expense and 2013 and 2012 operating expense in millions 

 

 the increase in operating expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to increases in real estate expenses 350 million technology expenses 267 million meeting and client entertainment expenses 216 million professional and banking fees 129 million business insurance 112 million office supplies 105 million other expense 105 million employee expense 103 million outside consulting fees 100 million licenses and fees 84 million premium financing interest expense 36 million outside services expense 33 million lease termination charges 05 million interest expense 04 million slightly offset by a favorable foreign currency translation 06 million and a decrease in bad debt expense 06 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2014 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2014 

  

the increase in operating expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to increases in technology expenses 126 million professional and banking fees 87 million outside consulting fees 75 million real estate expenses 79 million meeting and client entertainment expenses 60 million employee expense 40 million licenses and fees 36 million office supplies 33 million business insurance 28 million outside services expense 24 million bad debt expense 16 million slightly offset by a favorable foreign currency translation 21 million and decreases in lease termination charges 06 million interest expense 04 million and other expense 01 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2013 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2013 

depreciation  the increases in depreciation expense in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 were due primarily to the purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2014 2013 and 2012 were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years 

amortization  the increases in amortization in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and five to ten years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews in 2014 2013 and 2012 we wrote off 18 million 22 million and 34 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in the expense in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized 145 million 119 million and 93 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2014 2013 and 2012 acquisitions during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized 30 million of expense and 93 million and 57 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 67 77 and 45 acquisitions respectively 

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2011 to 2014 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income 

provision for income taxes  the brokerage segment’s effective tax rate in 2014 2013 and 2012 was 365 375 and 398 respectively we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 350 to 370 in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future 

  

risk management segment 

the risk management segment accounted for 14 of our revenue in 2014 the risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments in addition this segment generates revenues from integrated disability management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are substantially in the form of fees that are generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed 

on november 18 2014 we announced that a contract for the administration of workers’ compensation claims with the new south wales workers compensation scheme in australia would move to runoff status on december 31 2014 our estimated net earnings from this contract were 35 million in 2014 we took a 129 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily relating to a noncash impairment of capitalized software and personnel costs dedicated to servicing the new south wales runoff contract and we estimate that we will break even on this contract in 2015 during the runoff period

the increase in operating expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to increases in outside consulting fees 44 million professional and banking fees 35 million technology expenses 24 million meeting and client entertainment expense 17 million licenses and fees 08 million office supplies 03 million employee expense 01 million and bad debt expense 01 million offset by decreases in real estate expenses 18 million new zealand earthquake claims administration 15 million other expense 05 million interest expense 05 million business insurance 03 million lease termination charges 02 million and outside services 01 million 

depreciation  depreciation expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 which reflects the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems 

amortization  amortization expense remained relatively the same in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 historically the risk management segment has made few acquisitions we made no material acquisitions in this segment in 2014 or 2013 based on the results of impairment reviews in 2012 we wrote off 01 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the risk management segment acquisitions no indicators of impairment were noted in 2014 or 2013 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the decrease in income from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to an adjustment made in 2013 to the estimated fair value of an earnout obligation related to a revised projection of future performance for two acquisitions during 2013 we recognized 09 million of income related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance for two acquisitions 

provision for income taxes  the risk management segment’s effective tax rate in 2014 2013 and 2012 was 373 371 and 379 respectively we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 350 to 370 in our risk management segment for the foreseeable future 

diluted net earnings per share  on april 16 2014 we closed on a secondary public offering of our common stock issuing 2185 million shares of stock for net proceeds of 9114 million to fund the purchase of crombieoamps a brokerage segment acquisition the impact to diluted net earnings per share in the risk management segment for 2014 related to the shares issued under this secondary offering was a reduction of approximately 003 per share 

  

corporate segment 

the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our clean energy and other investments our debt and certain corporate and acquisitionrelated activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our investments at december 31 2014 and 2013 and a detailed discussion of the nature of these investments see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our debt at december 31 2014 and 2013 

financial information relating to our corporate segment results for 2014 2013 and 2012 in millions except per share and percentages 

 

 revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

 the increases in 2014 and 2013 are due to increased production at both the leased facilities and facilities in which we have a majority ownership position including the impact of the facilities we consolidated in 2014 and 2013 

 

 the increases in royalty income in 2014 and 2013 were due to increases in the production of refined coal by chemmod’s licensees 

  

expenses related to royalty income of chemmod were 384 million 212 million and 165 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively which include noncontrolling interest of 353 million 192 million and 146 million respectively 

 

 the losses in 2014 compared to 2013 were lower because the vast majority of our operations are now consolidated the increased pretax loss in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to increased production which generates increased pretax operating losses 

 

 cost of revenues  cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2014 2013 and 2012 consists of the cost of coal labor equipment maintenance chemicals supplies management fees and depreciation incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above including the costs to run the leased facilities 

compensation expense  compensation expense for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively includes salary and benefit expenses of 207 million 114 million and 98 million and incentive compensation of 296 million 127 million and 50 million respectively 

the increase in salary and benefit expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a 120 million charge related to the derisking strategy of our us defined benefit plan offset by a reduction in pension expense of 36 million in the period from september 12 2014 to november 30 2014 we offered a onetime voluntary lump sum window to eligible deferred vested participants in our us defined benefit plan in an effort to reduce our longterm pension obligations and the volatility of these obligations on our balance sheet the aggregate lump sum payout made in fourth quarter 2014 was 433 million this lump sum payout project reduced the plan’s pension benefit obligation by approximately 600 million while improving its pension underfunding by almost 170 million as of december 31 2014 due to this significant obligation settlement we incurred a noncash pretax charge of approximately 120 million in fourth quarter 2014 as a result of the us gaap requirement to expense the portion of the unrealized actuarial losses currently recognized as accumulated other comprehensive loss based on a ratio of the liability settled to the total liability within the plan at december 31 2014 the increase in salary and benefit expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to additional headcount and salary and benefits expense increases 

the increase in incentive compensation in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to the efforts in 2014 related to the transaction for the additional interests in the twelve clean coal plants the work on corporate related matters including the 2014 debt and secondary stock offering transactions and the level of acquisition activity in 2014 the increase in incentive compensation in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to the efforts in 2013 related to the sales and operations of the facilities in 2013 that qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 the work on corporate related matters including the 2013 debt transactions and the level of acquisition activity in 2013 

operating expense  operating expense for 2014 includes banking and related fees of 27 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2014 acquisitions of 189 million operating expenses professional fees and noncontrolling interest related to royalty income of 268 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 92 million and a biannual companywide meeting 22 million 

operating expense for 2013 includes banking and related fees of 30 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2013 acquisitions of 75 million operating expenses professional fees and noncontrolling interest related to royalty income of 152 million other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 70 million and a biannual companywide meeting 38 million 

  

operating expense for 2012 includes banking and related fees of 31 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2012 acquisitions of 71 million operating expenses professional fees and noncontrolling interest related to royalty income of 165 million and other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 61 million 

interest expense  the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012 was due to the following 

 

 the capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new corporate headquarters building will occur until the development of it is completed which is estimated to be done in the latter part of 2016 

depreciation  the increase in depreciation expense in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily relates to the assets of the additional ownership interests in the plants that we acquired from coinvestors in first quarters of 2013 and 2014 the depreciation expense in 2013 increased compared to 2012 which primarily relates to the additional ownership interests in the plants that we acquired from a coinvestor in first quarter 2013 

benefit for income taxes  our consolidated effective tax rate was 135 22 and 205 for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the tax rates for 2014 2013 and 2012 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year there were 1455 million 937 million and 438 million of tax credits generated and recognized in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2014 2013 and 2012 operating results for the corporate segment in millions 

 

  

    

interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt clean energy investments include the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production plants and chemmod acquisition costs include professional fees due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions in 2013 acquisition costs include a gain of 26 million on the derivative investment contract discussed above corporate consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and in 2014 and 2013 costs related to biannual companywide award crossselling and motivational meetings for our production staff and field management 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the fourteen plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the twenty plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2014 in millions 

 

 the information in the table above under the caption our portion of estimated ultimate annual aftertax earnings reflects management’s current best estimate of the ultimate future annual aftertax earnings based on production estimates from the host utilities however host utilities do not consistently utilize the refined coal plants at ultimate production levels due to seasonal electricity demand as well as for many operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons 

our investment in chemmod generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us an average of approximately 40 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to coinvestors and relinquish control of the plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling minority investor the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control as of any date we become a noncontrolling minority investor we deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting 

for all plants that are not under longterm production contracts we estimate that we will invest on average an additional 50 million per plant to connect and house each of them for those plants that will have majority ownership coinvestors the average additional investment will be 25 million we currently have no commitments related to our refined coal plants we further estimate that we will invest an additional 350 million to 450 million to redeploy the remainder of the refined coal plants later in 2015 and into 2016 before coinvestor contributions 

we are aware that some of the coalfired power plants that purchase the refined coal are considering changing to burning natural gas rather than coal or shutting down completely for economic reasons the entities that own such plants are prepared to move the refined coal plants to other generally higher volume coalfired power plants if these potential developments were to occur we estimate those plants will not operate for 12 to 18 months during their movement and redeployment which could have a material impact on the amount of tax credits that are generated by these plants 

  

there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 

  

 see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2014 and 2013 we relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement in addition for acquisitions made in 2014 we used proceeds from 6000 million and 7000 million of senior unsecured notes issued in february 2014 and june 2014 respectively plus a secondary public offering of our common stock in april 2014 whereby 2185 million shares of our stock were issued for net proceeds after underwriting discounts and other expenses related to this offering of 9114 million for acquisitions made in 2013 we also used proceeds from 2000 million of senior unsecured notes issued in september 2013 

cash provided by operating activities was 4023 million 3499 million and 3430 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2014 compared to 2013 partially offset by cash used in 2014 in the production and sale of refined coal at the plants qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by cash used in 2013 in the production and sale of refined coal at the plants qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted by the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized compared to the amount of tax credits actually used during the respective periods excess tax credits generated during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 6328 million and 5049 million for 2014 and 2013 respectively consolidated net earnings were 3034 million and 2686 million we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to 

  

quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2014 and 2013 plan years funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2014 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan during 2013 and 2012 we made discretionary contributions to the plan of 63 million and 72 million respectively we are not considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2015 but may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the plan in future periods 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 

in august 2014 we decided to pursue a pension derisking strategy to reduce the size of our longterm us defined benefit pension plan obligations and the volatility of these obligations on our balance sheet on september 12 2014 the fiduciaries of the plan began offering certain former employees who were participants in the plan the option of receiving the value of their pension benefit in a lump sum payment or as an accelerated reduced annuity in lieu of monthly annuity payments when they retire the voluntary offer was made to approximately 2500 terminated vested participants in the plan whose employment terminated with the company prior to august 1 2014 and who had not commenced benefit payments as of november 1 2014 eligible participants had from september 12 2014 to november 30 2014 to accept the offer and the lumpsum payments were made in november and december of 2014 and the accelerated reduced annuity payments began as of december 1 2014 the aggregate lump sum payout made in fourth quarter 2014 was 433 million all payouts related to this offer were made using assets from the plan this lump sum payout project reduced the plan’s pension benefit obligation by approximately 600 million while improving its pension underfunding by almost 170 million as of december 31 2014 due to this significant obligation settlement we incurred a noncash pretax charge of approximately 120 million in fourth quarter 2014 as a result of the us gaap requirement to expense the portion of the unrealized actuarial losses currently recognized as accumulated other comprehensive loss based on a ratio of the liability settled to the total liability within the plan at december 31 2014 

in 2014 the funded status of the plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2014 the net impact of the change in the discount rate at december 31 2014 and the lump sum payout in fourth quarter 2014 in the benefit obligation at december 31 2014 is flat in comparison to december 31 2013 in addition also favorably impacting the funded status were favorable returns on the plan’s assets in 2014 the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2014 resulted in an increase in noncurrent liabilities in 2014 of 372 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2014 2013 and 2012 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 815 million 936 million and 510 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in 2015 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 1200 million primarily related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment the increase in net capital expenditures in 2014 from 2013 and in 2013 from 2012 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2014 2013 and 2012 

  

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 19183 million 7277 million and 3441 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to three large acquisitions that occurred in 2014 the increased use of cash for acquisitions made in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to two large acquisitions that occurred in 2013 in addition during 2014 2013 and 2012 we issued 65 million shares 2928 million 52 million shares 2270 million and 78 million shares 2685 million respectively of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments we completed 60 31 and 60 acquisitions in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2014 2013 and 2012 totaled approximately 7612 million 3839 million and 2317 million respectively in 2015 we expect to use our debt cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete 

during 2012 we issued 425000 shares of our common stock and paid 35 million in cash related to earnout obligations of five acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 01 million 

dispositions  during 2014 2013 and 2012 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 73 million 52 million and 39 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 82 million 55 million and 114 million respectively related to these transactions offsetting the onetime gains related to sales of books of business in 2012 was a noncash loss of 35 million recognized in second quarter 2012 related to our acquisition of an additional 415 equity interest in cgm gallagher group limited which we refer to as cgm which increased our ownership in cgm to 80 the loss represented the decrease in fair value of our initial 385 equity interest in cgm based on the purchase price paid to acquire the additional 415 equity interest in cgm 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2014 we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate of the 2015 annual aftertax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits which will be generated from all of our clean energy investments is 900 million to 1100 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants by capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2015 however there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year therefore accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time nonetheless if current ownership interests remain the same if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remain at current levels and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits generated by our irc section 45 investments we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2015 through 2021 while we cannot accurately forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall please see “clean energy investments” on pages 42 and 43 for a more detailed description of these investments including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties 

cash flows from financing activities 

on september 19 2013 we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on september 19 2018 with a group of fifteen financial institutions the credit agreement replaced a 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on july 14 2014 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement all indebtedness liabilities and obligations outstanding under the previous facility were fully paid and satisfied except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement

the note purchase agreements the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2014 

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets

atthemarket equity program  on november 20 2013 we entered into an equity distribution agreement with morgan stanley  co llc pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to 200 million of which 1663 million is available of our common stock through morgan stanley as sales agent pursuant to the agreement shares may be sold by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions including on the new york stock exchange at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices in block transactions or as otherwise agreed upon by us and morgan stanley 

  

during the quarter and year ended december 31 2014 we sold 609886 shares of our common stock under the program at a weighted average price of 4811 per share resulting in net proceeds after sales commissions of approximately 03 million to morgan stanley of approximately 293 million 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 563 million in 2014 762 million in 2013 and 823 million in 2012 prior to 2009 we issued stock options under four stock optionbased employee compensation plans the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of 10 per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant in may 2008 all of these plans expired on may 10 2011 our stockholders approved the 2011 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2009 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 93 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip – 20 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of december 31 2014 were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2014 our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 and we believe will continue to do so in the foreseeable future 

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs except for 2008 and 2005 our earnings before income taxes adjusted for noncash items have increased year over year since 1991 in 2008 earnings before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations severance litigation impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation in 2005 earnings before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations we expect the historically favorable trend in earnings before income taxes adjusted for noncash items to continue in the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions additionally we anticipate a favorable impact on the amount we will pay the irs in 2015 and in future years based on anticipated tax credits from irc section 45 investments we also anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under the credit agreement and private placement debt described above under “cash flows from financing activities” and our common stock to fund acquisitions in addition we may from time to time consider other alternatives for longerterm funding sources such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings equity markets or restructuring our operations our microcaptive advisory services are the subject of an investigation by the irs see “results of operations—brokerage” above for more information regarding this investigation due to the early stage of this investigation and the fact that the irs has not made any allegations against us at this time we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss or impact on our liquidity in connection with this investigation 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 7 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2014 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 125 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes

credit agreement  on september 19 2013 we entered into a 6000 million unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on september 19 2018 with a group of fifteen financial investors the credit agreement replaced a 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on july 14 2014 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement all indebtedness liabilities and obligations outstanding under the previous facility were fully paid and satisfied except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 

we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time at december 31 2014 226 million of letters of credit see below under offbalance sheet debt were outstanding under the credit agreement there were 1400 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2014 accordingly at december 31 2014 4374 million remained available for potential borrowings of which 524 million may be in the form of additional letters of credit we are under no obligation to use the credit agreement in performing our normal business operations see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 

premium financing debt facility  on june 16 2014 we entered into a syndicated facility agreement revolving loan facility which we refer to as the premium financing debt facility that provides funding for the three acquired australian au and new zealand nz premium finance subsidiaries see note 3 “business combinations” the premium financing debt facility is comprised of i facility b is separate au1500 million and nz350 million tranches ii facility c is an au250 million equivalent multicurrency overdraft tranche and iii facility d is a nz150 million equivalent multicurrency overdraft tranche the premium financing debt facility expires june 15 2016 the premium financing debt facility provides funding for the three acquired australian and new zealand premium finance subsidiaries these premium funding related borrowings are fully collateralized by the underlying premium finance related receivables and as such are excluded from our debt covenant computations

operating lease obligations  we generally operate in leased premises at all of our locations certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 

we have leased certain office space to several nonaffiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements in the normal course of business we expect that certain of these leases will not be renewed or replaced we adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 

outstanding purchase obligations  we typically do not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we have outstanding as of december 31 2014 these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2014 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 339 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2011 to 2014 that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 5498 million of which 2053 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to a large acquisition we signed in april 2014 and completed in july 2014 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2014 and 2013 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2014 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 113 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 97 million at december 31 2014 we had posted seven letters of credit totaling 63 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity at december 31 2014 we had posted one letter of credit totaling 50 million to support our potential obligation under a client’s insurance program these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2014 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and our cash equivalents as of december 31 2014 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2014 

as of december 31 2014 we had 21250 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2014 was 22810 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on the income valuation approach which is a valuation technique that converts future amounts for example cash flows or income and expenses to a single current that is discounted amount the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts because our debt issuances generate a measurable income stream for each lender the income approach was deemed to be an appropriate methodology for valuing the private placement longterm debt the methodology used calculated the original deal spread at the time of each debt issuance which was equal to the difference between the yield of each issuance the coupon rate and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield at that time the market spread as of the valuation date was calculated which is equal to the difference between an index for investment grade insurers and the equivalent benchmark treasury yield today an implied premium or discount to the par value of each debt issuance based on the difference between the origination deal spread and market as of the valuation date was then calculated the index we relied on to represent investment graded insurers was the bloomberg valuation services bval us insurers bbb index this index is comprised primarily of insurance brokerage firms and was representative of the industry in which we operate for the purposes of our analysis the average bbb rate was assumed to be the appropriate borrowing rate for us based on the our current credit rating 

we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the private placement longterm debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2014 and the resulting fair values would be 3093 million higher than their carrying value or 24343 million we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2014 and the resulting fair values would be 152 million higher than their carrying value or 21402 million 

as of december 31 2014 we had 1400 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2014 and the resulting fair value is not be materially different from their carrying value 

at december 31 2014 we had 1279 million of borrowings outstanding under our premium financing debt facility the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2014 and the resulting fair value is not materially different from their carrying value 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian jamaican new zealand norwegian singaporean and various caribbean operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2014 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately 163 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2014 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would have increased by approximately 95 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations however our consolidated financial position is exposed 

  

to foreign currency exchange risk related to intraentity loans between our us based subsidiaries and our nonus based subsidiaries that are denominated in the respective local foreign currency a transaction that is in a foreign currency is first remeasured at the entity’s functional local currency where applicable which is an adjustment to consolidated earnings and then translated to the reporting us dollar currency which is an adjustment to consolidated stockholders’ equity for consolidated reporting purposes if the transaction is already denominated in the foreign entity’s functional currency only the translation to us dollar reporting is necessary the remeasurement process required by us gaap for such foreign currency loan transactions will give rise to a consolidated unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss which could be material that is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss 

historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in india and the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2014 2013 and 2012 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues in 2014 and disbursements in 2013 through various future payment dates in addition during 2014 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates although these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2014 2013 and 2012 see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2014 2013 and 2012 we entered into a au4000 million foreign currency derivative investment contract that we executed on april 16 2014 in connection with the signing of the agreement to acquire the crombieoamps operations this contract was designed to hedge a portion of the au denominated purchase price consideration of this acquisition the derivative investment contract was exercised on june 16 2014 the date that the crombieoamps transaction closed in second quarter 2014 we recorded a pretax gain of 19 million related to this derivative investment contract in the third quarter of 2013 we entered into three foreign currency derivative investment contracts in connection with the signing of an agreement to acquire the giles group of companies headquartered in london england these contracts were designed to hedge a portion of the gbp denominated purchase price consideration of this acquisition the derivative investment contracts were exercised on october 31 2013 and the giles transaction closed in early november 2013 in 2013 we recorded a pretax gain of 26 million related to these derivative investment contracts in the future we expect to continue hedging these types of transactions and other currencies as needed

see note 17 to our 2013 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information including earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2013 2012 and 2011 

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commission and fee revenues and the related brokerage and marketing expenses can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers on the other the hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of irc section 45 tax credits also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 16 to our 2013 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2013 and 2012 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 68 of our revenues in 2013 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and healthcare exchange and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance carriers which are usually based upon either a percentage of the premium paid by insureds or brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker by the insurer commission rates depend on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees paid to us by our clients depend on the extent and value of the services we provide in addition under certain circumstances we receive supplemental and contingent commissions for both retail and wholesale brokerage services a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid the insurance carrier determines the supplemental commission that is eligible to be paid annually based on historical performance criteria in advance of the contractual period a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

we operate our brokerage operations through a network of more than 400 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 22 other countries most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel in addition we offer clientservice capabilities in more than 140 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 18 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2013 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance these brokers operate through more than 65 geographical profit centers located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer’s business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

more than 75 of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as the largest domestic managing general agentunderwriting manager according to business insurance magazine’s september 23 2013 edition 

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 19 of our revenues in 2013 our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments approximately 68 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers compensation related claims 28 are from general and commercial auto liability related claims and 4 are from property related claims in addition we generate revenues from integrated disability management employee absence management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed

corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 13 of our revenues in 2013 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate costs the revenues reported by this segment in 2013 resulted primarily from our consolidation of refined fuel operations that we control and own more than 50 of and from leased facilities we operate and control at december 31 2013 significant investments managed by this segment include 

clean coal related ventures 

we have a 4654 interest in chemmod llc a privatelyheld enterprise chemmod that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we also have an 80 interest in a privatelyheld startup enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels 

taxadvantaged investments 

prior to january 1 2008 we owned certain partnerships formed to develop energy that qualified for tax credits under the former irc section 29 these consisted of wastetoenergy and synthetic coal operations these investments helped to substantially reduce our effective income tax rate from 2002 through 2007 the law that permitted us to claim irc section 29 tax credits expired on december 31 2007 in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s proprietary technologies and in 2013 we purchased 99 interests in five commercial clean coal production plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

international operations

 see notes 5 14 and 17 to our 2013 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2013 2012 and 2011 

brokerage operations in australia bermuda canada the caribbean and the uk 

the majority of our international brokerage operations are in australia bermuda canada the caribbean and the uk 

we operate in australia the caribbean and canada primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker in the uk we have a retail brokerage presence in more than 60 locations across the uk targeting small to medium enterprise risks an underwriting operation for clients to access the lloyd’s of london and other international insurance markets and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities in bermuda we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies 

we also have ownership interests in two bermudabased insurance companies and a guernseybased insurance company that operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these facilities enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive insurance companies are created for clients to insure their risks and capture underwriting profit and investment income which is then available for use by the insureds generally for reducing future costs of their insurance programs 

  

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 140 countries we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area 

risk management operations in australia canada new zealand and the uk 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the us and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

markets and marketing 

we manage our brokerage operations through a network of more than 400 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 22 other countries we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of approximately 100 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2013 our largest single customer accounted for approximately 1 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments and our ten largest customers represented 6 of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the aggregate our revenues are geographically diversified with both domestic and international operations 

each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small marketshare position and as a result we believe has substantial organic growth potential in addition each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small to mediumsized independent brokerages see “business combinations” below 

while historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically and we expect to continue to do so from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment 

we require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities plus all of our executive officers to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 15 2013 edition we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis group holdings ltd each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as jardine lloyd thomson group plc wells fargo insurance services inc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients in addition for healthwelfare products and benefit consultant services we compete with larger firms such as aon hewitt mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc towers watson  co midmarket firms such as lockton usi holdings and wells fargo and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies 

our wholesale brokerage operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc swett  crawford group inc as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers 

we also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrator based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s april 22 2013 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company and esis a subsidiary of ace limited several large insurance companies such as aig insurance and zurich insurance also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level we believe that our competitive position is due to our strong reputation for outstanding service and our ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most costefficient manner possible 

  

regulation 

we are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business in addition most jurisdictions require individuals who engage in brokerage claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities be personally licensed these licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in most jurisdictions licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities 

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 279 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2013 almost exclusively within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local propertycasualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas over the last decade we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas the total purchase price for individual acquisitions have typically ranged from 1 million to 50 million although in 2013 we completed two large acquisitions with total purchase price consideration that was in excess of 3000 million each 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

 item 1a  risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

an economic downturn as well as uncertainty regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

an overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy or be acquired by other companies which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could also result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

despite a recent agreement by european union officials on a system to wind down failed banks continued concerns regarding the ability of certain european countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets a potential consequence may be stagnant growth or even recession in the eurozone economies and beyond which could adversely affect our results of operations the market instability caused by the eurozone debt crisis has led to questions regarding the future viability of the euro as a single currency for the region the dissolution of the euro in the extreme case could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our results of operations in addition the value of our assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings would decline if currencies in the region were devalued 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example after three years of a “hard” market that began in late 2000 and was strengthened by the events of september 11 th  2001 in which premium rates were stable or increasing in late 2003 the market experienced the return of flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market in many lines and geographic areas this put downward pressure on our commission revenues in 2012 and 2013 the market began “firming” as opposed to traditional “hardening” across many lines and geographic areas in this environment rates increased at a moderate pace clients could still obtain coverage businesses continued to stay in standardline markets and there was adequate capacity in the market it is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the current economic environment because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commissionbased compensation 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office our risk management operation also faces significant competition from standalone firms as well as divisions of larger firms 

we believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

   

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefits consulting firms and risk management firms we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

historically we have acquired large numbers of insurance brokers benefits consulting firms and risk management firms our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equitybacked consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically 

postacquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated contingencies or liabilities such as violations of sanctions laws or anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act tax and accounting issues and integration difficulties relating to accounting information technology human resources or organizational culture and fit some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth postacquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as casanueva perez sap de cv grupo cp in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

we conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the us including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries for example we have operations in india to provide certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations 

our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risk that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations 

a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume andor growth thresholds andor insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent commissions andor supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our client relationships growth strategy compliance programs and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses for example certain of our competitors have launched consulting operations that leverage global insurance placement data if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or product offerings we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships growth strategy compliance programs and operating results 

our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster material cybersecurity attack or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located for example our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services disruptions could be caused by among other things restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics material cybersecurity attacks or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies however such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable 

many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision including insurance industry regulation federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies such as the securities and exchange commission sec and department of justice doj and internal revenue service irs in the us and the financial services authority fsa in the uk such regulations could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs 

in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business for example we offer captive design and management services and group captive development services and expect to be able to continue offering such services the national association of insurance commissioners naic has established a subgroup to study the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk in relation to existing state laws and regulations any action by federal state or other regulators that adversely affects our ability to offer services in relation to captives either retroactively or prospectively could have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past decade because of the potential for conflicts of interest adverse regulatory developments regarding the forms of compensation we can receive for example continent commissions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws 

the fcpa uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials and otherwise and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our training program and policies mandate compliance with such laws we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the uk by the fsa and one was investigated in the us by the sec and doj for improper payments to foreign officials these firms paid significant settlements and undertook internal investigations if we are alleged to have violated or found to be liable for violations of anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our third party partners or agents we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm 

our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 health care reform legislation 

the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns in addition if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law particularly the “employer mandate” scheduled to enter into effect in january 2015 our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured provide clients with appropriate consulting and claims handling services or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements we are subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities and damage to our professional reputation 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality brokerage and risk management services so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to their needs if a client is not satisfied with our services it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could 

  

cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups andor trade associations and actively share information amongst themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients 

the nature of much of our work especially our actuarial services in our benefits consulting business involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance similarly in our institutional investment consulting and our retirement services consulting businesses we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may nonetheless claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information from threats such as a cybersecurity attack nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue in the past we have experienced attempts to wrongfully access our computer and information systems which if successful could have resulted in harm to our business our systems were successful in identifying the risk and preventing unauthorized access and management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations however there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents that could have a material impact on our business will not occur 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations that sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services and may be more stringent in some jurisdictions outside the us our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability fines and penalties and could damage our reputation 

significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments including our irc section 45 investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments our ability to generate returns and avoid writeoffs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties these include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties as set forth below 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals such laws and regulations also impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise involved in the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using the chemmod™ solution in a number of ways including air emissions waste water and byproducts such as fly ash one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chemmod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution for example we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage diminution of property or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment 

our corporate segment holds a variety of investments these investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation tax audits and disputes failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability additionally our cash holdings including cash held in our fiduciary capacity are subject to the credit liquidity and other risks faced by our financial institution counterparties 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments 

the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities should we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in our company 

volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders 

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” on page 26 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures 

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks we are headquartered in itasca illinois have operations in 24 countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 140 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants we generate approximately 77 of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically with the remaining 23 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada the caribbean singapore new zealand and the uk substantially all of the revenues of the corporate segment are generated in the united states we have three reportable segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 68 19 and 13 respectively to 2013 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from our investment portfolio which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds as well as clean energy and other investments 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

overview and 2013 financial highlights 

we have generated positive organic growth in the last twelve quarterly periods in both our brokerage and risk management segments based on our experience we believe we are seeing continued evidence of moderate rate increases and our customers are increasingly optimistic about their business prospects the first quarter 2013 council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab survey indicated that rates were up on average 52 across all sized accounts the second quarter 2013 ciab survey indicated that rates were up on average 43 across all sized accounts the third quarter 2013 ciab survey indicated that rates were up on average 34 across all sized accounts the fourth quarter 2013 ciab survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report but we anticipate that the trends evident in the third quarter 2013 survey continued into the fourth quarter rates continued to rise throughout 2013 as insurance carriers tightened their underwriting standards and pressed for higher pricing and deductibles on renewals in critical areas such as property and workers compensation in addition insurance carriers are still trying to reduce their exposure to property risks with catastrophicloss exposure on the eastern coast of the us due to the ongoing impact of “superstorm sandy” the third quarter 2013 survey also indicated that carriers have tightened terms and conditions and lowered limits for exposures such as storm surge flood and offsite power among others however the overall firming market appears to have moderated during the second half of 2013 the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 80 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

our operating results improved in 2013 compared to 2012 in both our brokerage and risk management segments 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2013 revenues ebitdac and diluted net earnings loss per share to 2012 

 

 we achieved these results by among other things demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy and generating organic growth in our core businesses in 2013 we continued to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth by the end of 2013 23 of our revenues were generated internationally in our combined brokerage and risk management segments compared with 21 in 2012 we expect this international revenue trend to continue in 2014 

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 

  

as markets harden certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

recent events 

in 2013 the insurance market continued to show signs of “firming” as opposed to traditional “hardening” across many lines and geographic areas in this environment rates increased at a moderate pace clients could still obtain coverage businesses continued to stay in standardline markets and there was adequate capacity in the insurance market it is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the current economic environment despite the official end of the recession and recent signs of an economic recovery the deterioration in the economy that began in the fall of 2008 continued to adversely impact us in 2013 and could continue to do so in future years as a result of potential reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients may purchase due to reductions in among other things their headcount payroll properties and the market value of their assets such reductions could also adversely impact our commission revenues in future years if the propertycasualty insurance carriers perform exposure audits that lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy 

clean energy investments  in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s see below proprietary technologies in addition on september 1 2013 we purchased a 99 interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five clean coal production plants we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

twentyeight plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities the remaining six plants are in various stages of engineering negotiating finalizing and signing longterm production contracts several of the remaining six plants could be in production starting in late 2014 with the balance expected to be in production in 2015 

we also own a 4654 controlling interest in chemmod which has been marketing the chemmod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 36 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

our current estimate of the 2014 annual aftertax earnings that could be generated from all of our clean energy investments in 2014 is between 650 million to 800 million if we continue to have success in entering additional longterm production contracts we could generate more aftertax earnings in 2015 and beyond 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts typically we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of propertycasualty insurance policy transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit brokerage operations under these direct bill arrangements the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions that we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services that we provide over a period of time typically one year we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 

income taxes  our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return we evaluate our tax positions using a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position if a tax position does not meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

  

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses our primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements or trade names expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and five to fifteen years for trade names while goodwill is not subject to amortization the establishment of goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods different estimates or assumptions could produce different results we carry intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 

we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2013 2012 and 2011 we wrote off 22 million 35 million and 46 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets primarily related to prior year acquisitions of our brokerage segment the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations including the accretion of discount in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 

the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections that are developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections we then discount these payments to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration marketbased rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets changes in financial projections market participant assumptions for revenue growth andor profitability or the riskadjusted discount rate would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2013 business combinations 

business combinations and dispositions 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2013 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2013 2012 or 2011 historically we have used acquisitions to grow our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries we expect that our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow as a result of acquisitions we intend to continue to consider from time to time additional acquisitions for our brokerage and risk management segments on terms that we deem advantageous at any particular time we are generally engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates however we can make no assurances that any additional acquisitions will be consummated or if consummated that they will be advantageous to us 

  

results of operations 

information regarding nongaap measures and other 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information related to organic revenues and ebitdac although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided certain reclassifications have been made to the prioryear amounts reported in this report in order to conform them to the current year presentation 

adjusted presentation  we believe that the adjusted presentation of our 2013 2012 and 2011 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

 earnings measures  we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segment each as defined below provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability 

 

  

  

  

  

   

organic revenues  for the brokerage segment organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition change in organic growth excludes the impact of supplemental and contingent commission revenues and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation and disposed of operations the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same prior year periods for the risk management segment organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented in addition change in organic growth excludes the impact of south australian ramp up fees new zealand earthquake claims administration and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2014 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this measure allows financial statement users to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 

reconciliation of nongaap information presented to gaap measures  this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin diluted net earnings per share as adjusted and organic revenue measures 

other information 

allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue headcount and other information we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were computing income tax provisions on a separate company basis as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our twenty 2011 era plants we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 370 to 390 in both our brokerage segment and our risk management segment for the foreseeable future reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results pretax profit margin compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio pretax profit margin represents pretax net earnings divided by total revenues the compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues the operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 68 of our revenue in 2013 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period

operating expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2013 operating expense to 2012 and 2012 operating expense to 2011 in millions 

 

 the increase in operating expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to increases in technology expenses 126 million professional and banking fees 87 million outside consulting fees 75 million real estate expenses 79 million meeting and client entertainment expenses 60 million employee expense 40 million licenses and fees 36 million office supplies 33 million business insurance 28 million outside services expense 24 million bad debt expense 16 million slightly offset by a favorable foreign currency translation 21 million lease termination charges 06 million interest expense 04 million and other expense 01 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2013 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2013 

  

the increase in operating expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to a unfavorable foreign currency translation 16 million and increases in technology expenses 122 million professional and banking fees 68 million meeting and client entertainment expenses 66 million outside consulting fees 51 million real estate expenses 43 million office supplies 42 million licenses and fees 32 million employee expense 24 million outside services expense 14 million bad debt expense 08 million and lease termination charges 06 million offset by decreases in business insurance 33 million and other expense 03 million offset also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2013 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2013

amortization  the increases in amortization in 2013 compared to 2012 and in 2012 compared to 2011 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for noncompete agreements and five to fifteen years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews in 2013 2012 and 2011 we wrote off 22 million 34 million and 46 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in the expense in 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2013 2012 and 2011 we recognized 119 million 93 million and 83 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2013 2012 and 2011 acquisitions during 2013 2012 and 2011 we recognized 93 million 57 million and 145 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 77 45 and 22 acquisitions respectively 

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2011 to 2013 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income 

the income generated from the net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in 2011 was primarily related to our acquisition of the policy renewal rights from liberty mutual and the wausau signature agency which we refer to as liberty mutual in february 2009 as part of this transaction we acquired over 250 producers account managers and service staff from liberty mutual due to the underlying market conditions existing in early 2009 at the date of the transaction a deteriorating economy and uncertainty of when it would recover and the significant uncertainties related to this transaction that could affect the performance of the liberty mutual business we purchased the policy renewal rights related to liberty mutual’s middlemarket commercial pc business located in their midwest and southeast regions as opposed to buying a standalone brokerage agency a portion of the liberty business was cobrokered the extent of which was not known by liberty mutual at the time of the acquisition and the risks associated with moving captive agents to an open brokerage environment we structured this acquisition such that approximately 70 of the maximum purchase price was based on a three year earnout period we paid approximately 450 million as of the acquisition date with a potential maximum earnout payable of up to 1200 million to be paid in second quarter 2012 as of the acquisition date we initially estimated and recorded an earnout payable of approximately 640 million based on financial projections that incorporated assumptions to address the risks noted above we monitored and updated the financial projections for this business using actual results during the earnout period and made adjustments to the recorded earnout payable when applicable during 2011 and 2012 we had seen some deterioration in client retention related to this business primarily due to cobrokered business and had been rationalizing staffing levels which resulted in downward adjustments to our estimated financial projections and a decrease in the recorded earnout payable in both 2011 and 2012 in august 2012 we paid out 324 million 248 million in our common stock and 76 million in cash to liberty mutual related to this earnout obligation 

provision for income taxes  the brokerage segment’s effective tax rate in 2013 2012 and 2011 was 375 398 and 387 respectively we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 370 to 390 in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future

financial information relating to our corporate segment results for 2013 2012 and 2011 in millions except per share and percentages 

 

 revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

 the increase in 2013 is due to increased production at both the leased facilities and facilities in which we have a majority ownership position the increase in 2012 is due primarily to increased production from the leased facilities

expenses related to royalty income of chemmod were 212 million 165 million and 32 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively which include noncontrolling interest of 192 million 146 million and 17 million respectively 

 

 the increased pretax loss in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to increased production which generates increased pretax operating losses the increased pretax loss in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to increased production which generates increased pretax operating losses 

 

 cost of revenues  cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2013 2012 and 2011 consists of the expenses incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above including the costs to run the leased facilities

the increase in salary and benefit expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to additional headcount and salary and benefits expense increases the increase in salary and benefit expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to a 24 million increase in pension expense and additional headcount and salary and benefits expense increases 

the increase in incentive compensation in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to the increased compensation in 2013 related to the sales and operations of the facilities in 2013 that qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 and the efforts made on corporate related matters including the three 2013 debt transactions and the level of acquisition activity in 2013 the decrease in incentive compensation in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to the higher compensation in 2011 related to the sales and operations of the facilities that qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

operating expense  operating expense for 2013 includes banking and related fees of 30 million external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2013 acquisitions of 75 million operating expenses professional fees and noncontrolling interest related to royalty income of 212 million and other corporate and clean energy related expenses of 10 million and a biannual companywide meeting 38 million

benefit for income taxes  our consolidated effective tax rate was 22 205 and 306 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year there were 937 million 438 million and 132 million of tax credits generated and recognized in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2013 operating results for the corporate segment with 2012 and 2011 in millions 

 

 interest and banking primarily includes expenses related to our debt clean energy investments include the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production and chemmod acquisition costs include professional fees due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions in 2013 acquisition costs include a gain of 26 million on the derivative investment contract discussed above corporate consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and in 2013 and 2011 costs related to a biannual companywide award crossselling and motivational meeting for our production staff and field management legacy investments include the operating results related to the winddown of our legacy investment portfolio 

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1 2013 all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the fourteen plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the twenty plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

the following table provides a summary of our clean coal plant investments as of december 31 2013 in millions 

 

 the information in the table above under the caption our portion of estimated ultimate annual aftertax earnings reflects management’s current best estimate of the ultimate future annual aftertax earnings based on production estimates from the host utilities however host utilities do not consistently utilize the refined coal plants at ultimate production levels due to seasonal electricity demand as well as many operational regulatory and environmental compliance reasons 

our investment in chemmod generates royalty income from refined coal plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal plants owned by other unrelated parties based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could potentially generate for us approximately 36 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

  

there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 

  

 see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2013 and 2012 we relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement in addition for acquisitions made in 2013 we used proceeds from the 2000 million note purchase agreement we entered into on september 19 2013 and for acquisitions made in 2012 we used proceeds from the 500 million note purchase agreement we entered into on july 10 2012 

cash provided by operating activities was 3499 million 3430 million and 2840 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by cash used in 2013 in the production and sale of refined coal at the plants qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and the realization of other current assets and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2012 compared to 2011 our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted by the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized compared to the amount of tax credits actually used during the respective periods excess tax credits generated during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets which is a net use of cash related to operating activities 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 5049 million and 4321 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

  

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2013 and 2012 plan years the minimum funding requirement under the irc was 03 million in 2011 this level of required funding is based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2013 2012 and 2011 we made discretionary contributions to the plan of 63 million 72 million and 72 million respectively we are considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2014 and may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the plan in future periods see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates in 2013 the funded status of the plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2013 resulting in a 195 million decrease in the benefit obligation at december 31 2013 in addition also favorably impacting the funded status were favorable returns on the plan’s assets in 2013 which combined with the 63 million of discretionary contributions made to the plan in 2013 resulted in an increase in the plan’s invested assets of 275 million at december 31 2013 the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2013 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2013 of 470 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2013 2012 and 2011 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 936 million 510 million and 459 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively in 2014 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 900 million primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment the increase in net capital expenditures in 2013 from 2012 and in 2012 from 2011 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 7277 million 3441 million and 2648 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions made in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to two large acquisitions that occurred in 2013 the increased use of cash for acquisitions made in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in the number of acquisition that occurred in 2012 in addition during 2013 2012 and 2011 we issued 51 million shares 2231 million 60 million shares 2036 million and 32 million shares 906 million respectively of our common stock as consideration paid for acquisitions we completed 31 60 and 32 acquisitions in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively annualized revenues of entities acquired in 2013 2012 and 2011 totaled approximately 3839 million 2317 million and 2770 million respectively in 2014 we expect to fund our acquisitions using debt and cash from operations and our common stock on occasion for example to effect a taxfree exchange or if our overall acquisition activity warrants it 

during 2012 we issued 425000 shares of our common stock and paid 35 million in cash related to earnout obligations of five acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 01 million during 2011 we issued 245000 shares of our common stock paid 82 million in cash and accrued 183 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 19 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 300 million 

dispositions  during 2013 2012 and 2011 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 52 million 39 million and 55 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 55 million 114 million and 140 million respectively related to these transactions offsetting the onetime gains related to sales of books of business in 2012 was a noncash loss of 35 million recognized in second quarter 2012 related to our acquisition of an additional 415 equity interest in cgm gallagher group limited which we refer to as cgm which increased our ownership in cgm to 80 the loss represents the decrease in fair value of our initial 385 equity interest in cgm based on the purchase price paid to acquire the additional 415 equity interest in cgm 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2013 we made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 our current estimate 

  

of the 2014 annual aftertax earnings including irc section 45 tax credits that will be generated from all of our clean energy investments in 2014 is 650 million to 800 million the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay which is offset by capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases relocation of refined coal plants we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2014 with the expected increased earnings from the irc section 45 investments in 2015 through 2021 and the anticipated minimal capital expenditures during that same period we anticipate that the annual positive net cash flow during those years will continue to increase we anticipate that this favorable impact on the amount we will pay the irs in 2014 and in future years from irc section 45 investments will allow us to use these positive cash flows to fund acquisitions please see “clean energy investments” beginning on page 38 for a more detailed description of these investments including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties 

cash flows from financing activities 

on september 19 2013 we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on september 19 2018 with a group of fifteen financial institutions the credit agreement replaced a 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on july 14 2014 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement all indebtedness liabilities and obligations outstanding under the previous facility were fully paid and satisfied except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 

our credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to 6000 million of which up to 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 500 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 8500 million 

in 2007 2009 2011 2012 and 2013 we entered into separate note purchase agreements with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors 4000 million 1500 million 1250 million 500 million and 2000 million in aggregate debt respectively totaling 9250 million which was outstanding at december 31 2013 and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 2981 million we also use our credit agreement from time to time to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement there were 5305 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2013 due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit 535 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2013 

on december 20 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for a private placement of 6000 million of senior unsecured notes under the agreement funding is expected to occur on february 27 2014 we intend to use the proceeds of the debt transaction primarily to pay down our line of credit facility 

during 2013 we borrowed an aggregate of 8905 million and repaid 4890 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2013 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2012 we borrowed 3030 million and repaid 1840 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2012 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2011 we borrowed 1510 million and repaid 1410 million under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2011 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes 

the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2013 

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors declares dividends on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2013 we declared 1826 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 140 per common share on december 20 2013 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 35 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 4 2013 on january 23 2014 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2014 of 36 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 36 per common share throughout 2014 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2014 of approximately 1909 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2013 or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately 83 million we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

  

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors we did not repurchase any shares in 2013 2012 and 2011 we generally hold repurchased shares for reissuance in connection with our equity compensation and stock option plans under the provisions of the repurchase plan we were authorized to repurchase approximately 10000000 additional shares at december 31 2013 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources there were no common stock repurchases made in 2013 that impacted our consolidated financial statements the common stock repurchases reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2012 and 2011 include 82000 shares at a cost of 15 million and 41000 shares at a cost of 12 million respectively that we repurchased from our employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years under these circumstances we withhold the proceeds from the repurchases and remit them to the taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 

atthemarket equity program  on november 20 2013 we entered into an equity distribution agreement with morgan stanley  co llc pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to 200 million of our common stock through morgan stanley as sales agent pursuant to the agreement shares may be sold by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions including on the new york stock exchange at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices in block transactions or as otherwise agreed upon by us and morgan stanley 

during the quarter ended december 31 2013 we sold 91572 shares of our common stock under the program at a weighted average price of 4741 per share resulting in net proceeds after sales commissions of approximately 43000 to morgan stanley of approximately 43 million 

shelf registration statement  on november 20 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock we have used this registration statement and expect to continue using this registration statement to register shares sold under our atthemarket equity program referred to above the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we can make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any additional shares under this registration statement 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 762 million in 2013 823 million in 2012 and 739 million in 2011 prior to 2009 we issued stock options under four stock optionbased employee compensation plans the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of 10 per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant in may 2008 all of these plans expired on may 10 2011 our stockholders approved the 2011 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2009 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 80 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip  05 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2013 in addition we have an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs except for 2008 and 2005 our earnings before income taxes adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac have increased year over year since 1991 in 2008 earnings before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations severance litigation impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation in 2005 earnings before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations we expect the historically favorable trend in earnings before income taxes adjusted for noncash items to continue in the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions additionally we anticipate a favorable impact on the amount we will pay the irs in 2014 and in future years based on anticipated tax credits from irc section 45 investments we also anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under the credit agreement and private placement debt described above under “cash flows from financing activities” and our common stock to fund acquisitions in addition we may from time to time consider other alternatives for longerterm funding sources such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings equity markets or restructuring our operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business or if our acquisition program continues at or increases from the same level as 2013 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 6 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2013 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 92 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

note purchase agreements  on august 3 2007 we entered into a note purchase agreement as amended and restated on december 19 2007 with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 1000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 626 senior notes series a due august 3 2014 and 3000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 644 senior notes series b due august 3 2017 in a private placement

see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements 

credit agreement  on september 19 2013 we entered into a 6000 million unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on september 19 2018 with a group of fifteen financial investors the credit agreement replaced a 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on july 14 2014 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement all indebtedness liabilities and obligations outstanding under the previous facility were fully paid and satisfied except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 

  

we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time at december 31 2013 160 million of letters of credit see below under offbalance sheet debt were outstanding under the credit agreement there were 5305 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2013 accordingly at december 31 2013 535 million remained available for potential borrowings of which 535 million may be in the form of additional letters of credit we are under no obligation to use the credit agreement in performing our normal business operations see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 

operating lease obligations  we generally operate in leased premises at our other locations certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 

we have leased certain office space to several nonaffiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements in the normal course of business we expect that the leases will not be renewed or replaced we adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 

outstanding purchase obligations  as a service company we typically do not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we have outstanding as of december 31 2013 these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2013 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 279 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our 2011 to 2013 acquisitions that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the aggregate amount of the maximum potential earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 4623 million of which 1627 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for under the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2013 and 2012 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2013 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 98 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 90 million at december 31 2013 we had posted five letters of credit totaling 62 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2013 that are sensitive 

  

to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and our cash equivalents as of december 31 2013 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2013 

we have other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions which can change rapidly in addition some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from us a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if we elect to withdraw financial or operational support 

as of december 31 2013 we had 9250 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2013 was 9794 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate an allin interest rate for discounting we obtained market quotes for notes with the same terms as ours which we have deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates we have not adjusted this rate for risk profile changes covenant issues or credit rating changes we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2013 and the resulting fair values would be 423 million higher than their carrying value or 9673 million 

as of december 31 2013 we had 5305 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates associated with these debt obligations market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2013 and the resulting fair value is not be materially different from their carrying value 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian singaporean jamaican and various caribbean operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2013 a weakening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would decrease by approximately 41 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2013 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings before income taxes would increase by approximately 43 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars however it is management’s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to our consolidated operating results or financial position we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2013 2012 and 2011 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency revenues in 2013 and disbursements in 2012 through various future payment dates in addition during 2013 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that were designed to hedge a significant portion of our future indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates these hedging strategies were designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements but we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of the payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2013 2012 and 2011 see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2013 2012 and 2011 in the third quarter of 2013 we entered into three foreign currency derivative investment contracts in connection with the signing of an agreement to acquire the giles group of companies headquartered in london england these contracts were designed to hedge a portion of the gbp denominated purchase price consideration of this acquisition the derivative investment contracts were exercised on october 31 2013 and the giles transaction closed in early november 2013 in 2013 we recorded a pretax gain of 26 million related to these derivative investment contracts

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations information with respect to all sources of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012 is as follows in millions 

 

 see note 17 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information including earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commission and fee revenues and the related brokerage and marketing expenses can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers on the other the hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions and recognition of investment gains and losses also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 16 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2012 and 2011 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 73 of our revenues in 2012 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and healthcare exchange and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance carriers which are usually based upon either a percentage of the premium paid by insureds or brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker by the insurer commission rates depend on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees paid to us by our clients depend on the extent and value of the services we provide in addition under certain circumstances we receive supplemental and contingent commissions for both retail and wholesale brokerage services a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid the insurance carrier determines the supplemental commission that is eligible to be paid annually based on historical performance criteria in advance of the contractual period a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

we operate our brokerage operations through a network of approximately 350 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 17 other countries most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel in addition we offer clientservice capabilities in more than 140 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 76 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2012 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows 

 

 our retail brokerage operations are organized in more than 300 geographical profit centers primarily located in the us australia canada and uk and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 61 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups we serve are as follows 

 

 our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries or business segments we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

  

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

 

  

  

  

 wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 24 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2012 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance these brokers operate through more than 65 geographical profit centers located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer’s business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

more than 75 of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as the largest domestic managing general agentunderwriting manager according to business insurance magazine’s october 8 2012 edition 

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 22 of our revenues in 2012 our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments approximately 68 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers compensation related claims 27 are from general and commercial auto liability related claims and 5 are from property related claims in addition we generate revenues from integrated disability management employee absence management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed 

risk management services are primarily marketed directly to fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies notforprofit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of approximately 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients and customers 

while this segment complements our insurance brokerage offerings more than 88 of our risk management segment’s revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers such as insurance companies and clients of other insurance brokers based on revenues our risk management operation ranked as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrator according to business insurance magazine’s august 13 2012 edition 

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from increased levels of business with fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies captives program business and the outsourcing of insurance company claims departments in addition the risk management segment may grow in the future through mergers and acquisitions 

  

corporate segment 

the corporate segment accounted for 5 of our revenues in 2012 the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate costs the revenues reported by this segment in 2012 resulted primarily from our consolidation of refined fuel operations that we control and own more than 50 of and from leased facilities we operate and control at december 31 2012 significant investments managed by this segment include 

clean coal related ventures 

we have a 4654 interest in a privatelyheld enterprise chemmod llc that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coalfired power plants we also have an 80 interest in a privatelyheld startup enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels 

taxadvantaged investments 

prior to january 1 2008 we owned certain partnerships formed to develop energy that qualified for tax credits under the former irc section 29 these consisted of wastetoenergy and synthetic coal operations these investments helped to substantially reduce our effective income tax rate from 2002 through 2007 the law that permitted us to claim irc section 29 tax credits expired on december 31 2007 in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s proprietary technologies we believe these operations produce refined coal that will qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

international operations 

our total revenues by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012 were as follows in millions 

 

 see notes 5 14 and 17 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2012 2011 and 2010 

brokerage operations in australia bermuda canada and the uk 

the majority of our international brokerage operations are in australia bermuda canada and the uk 

we operate in australia and canada primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker in the uk we also have a retail brokerage and underwriting operation for clients to access the lloyd’s of london and other international insurance markets and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities in bermuda we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies 

we also have ownership interests in two bermudabased insurance companies and a guernseybased insurance company that operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these facilities enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive insurance companies are created for clients to insure their risks and capture underwriting profit and investment income which is then available for use by the insureds generally for reducing future costs of their insurance programs 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 140 countries we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area 

risk management operations in australia canada new zealand and the uk 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the us and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

  

markets and marketing 

we manage our brokerage operations through a network of approximately 350 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 17 other countries we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of approximately 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2012 our largest single customer accounted for approximately 2 of total revenues and our ten largest customers represented 5 of total revenues in the aggregate our revenues are geographically diversified with both domestic and international operations 

each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small marketshare position and as a result we believe has substantial organic growth potential in addition each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small to mediumsized independent brokerages see “business combinations” below 

while historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically and we expect to continue to do so from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment 

we require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities including all of our executive officers to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 16 2012 edition we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with aon plc marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis group holdings ltd each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as wells fargo insurance services inc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients in addition for healthwelfare products and benefit consultant services we compete with larger firms such as aon hewitt mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc towers watson  co and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies 

our wholesale brokerage operations compete with large wholesalers such as crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc swett  crawford group inc as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers 

we also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party administrator based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s august 13 2012 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company and esis a subsidiary of ace limited several large insurance companies such as aig insurance and zurich insurance also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors in addition we compete with various smaller third party administrators on a regional level we believe that our competitive position is due to our strong reputation for outstanding service and our ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most costefficient manner possible 

regulation 

we are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business in addition most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities be personally licensed these licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in most jurisdictions licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities 

  

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 248 acquisitions from january 1 2002 through december 31 2012 almost exclusively within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local propertycasualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas over the last decade we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas the total purchase price for individual acquisitions have typically ranged from 1 million to 50 million 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example after three years of a “hard” market that began in late 2000 and was strengthened by the events of september 11 th  2001 in which premium rates were stable or increasing in late 2003 the market experienced the return of flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market in many lines and geographic areas this put downward pressure on our commission revenues in 2012 the market began showing signs of “firming” as opposed to traditional “hardening” across many lines and geographic areas in this environment rates increased at a moderate pace clients could still obtain coverage businesses continued to stay in standardline markets and there was adequate capacity in the market it is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the current economic environment because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities 

  

an economic downturn as well as uncertainty regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

an overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our client overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could also result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

continued concerns regarding the ability of certain european countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets a potential consequence may be stagnant growth or even recession in the eurozone economies and beyond which could adversely affect our results of operations the market instability caused by the eurozone debt crisis has led to questions regarding the future viability of the euro as a single currency for the region the dissolution of the euro in the extreme case could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our results of operations in addition the value of our assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings would decline if currencies in the region were devalued 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country region or locality may have in that country region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office as a us company with significant operations around the world lower combined corporate tax rates in the countries where our overseas competitors are located could impact our ability to compete with such companies we believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and benefits consulting firms we may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations 

historically we have completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and benefits consulting firms and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in us achieving slower growth continuing consolidation in our industry could make it more difficult to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets following acquisition in a manner that allows us to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions our ability to integrate acquisitions may decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically our acquisitions also pose the risk of postacquisition deterioration which could result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges to earnings 

additionally we may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with our acquisitions these could include liabilities relating to regulatory or compliance issues including among other things liabilities relating to violations of the fcpa uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws when we acquire businesses with international operations these liabilities could also include unforeseen integration difficulties resulting in unanticipated expense relating to accounting information technology human resources or culture and fit issues if any of these developments occur our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control such as casanueva perez sap de cv grupo cp in mexico and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits including mitigation of risks that could be achieved through full integration 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

we conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the us including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries for example we use thirdparty service providers located in india for certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations or ability to use thirdparty providers in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations 

our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risk that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations 

a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume andor growth thresholds andor insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent commissions andor supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in the past we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

  

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our client relationships growth strategy compliance programs and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships growth strategy compliance programs and operating results 

our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster material cybersecurity attack or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located for example our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services disruptions could be caused by among other things restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics material cybersecurity attacks or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies however such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable 

many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision including insurance industry regulation federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies such as the securities and exchange commission sec and department of justice doj in the us and the financial services authority fsa in the uk as our operations grow around the world it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs 

in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business for example although our inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois ended on october 1 2009 compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public state attorneys general and state insurance departments this could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice if this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws 

the fcpa uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials and otherwise and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls our training program and policies mandate compliance with such laws we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the uk by the fsa and one was investigated in the us by the sec and doj for improper payments to foreign officials these firms paid significant settlements and undertook internal investigations if we are found to be liable for violations of anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our third party partners or agents we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm 

  

our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 health care reform legislation 

in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of portions of the 2010 health care reform legislation the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns in addition if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured provide clients with appropriate consulting and claims handling services or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements we are subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information from threats such as a cybersecurity attack nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue in the past we have experienced attempts to wrongfully access our computer and information systems which if successful could have resulted in harm to our business our systems were successful in identifying the risk and preventing unauthorized access and management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations however there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents that could have a material impact on our business will not occur 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations that sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services and may be more stringent in some jurisdictions outside the us our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage our reputation 

significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments our ability to generate returns and avoid writeoffs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties these include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties as set forth below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals such laws and regulations also impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise involved in the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using the chemmod™ solution in a number of ways including air emissions waste water and byproducts such as fly ash one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chem mod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution for example we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage diminution of property or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment 

our corporate segment holds a variety of investments these investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation tax audits and disputes failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability additionally our cash holdings including cash held in our fiduciary capacity are subject to the credit liquidity and other risks faced by our financial institution counterparties 

  

the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments 

the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all 

economic financial and industry conditions beyond our control may affect our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our debt the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under such agreements to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities should we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in our company 

volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders 

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

we have a common stock repurchase plan that our board of directors adopted on may 10 1988 and has periodically amended since that date to authorize additional shares for repurchase the last amendment was on january 24 2008 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the repurchase plan during the fourth quarter of 2012 under the repurchase plan as of december 31 2012 we continue to have the authority to repurchase approximately 10000000 shares of our common stock the repurchase plan has no expiration date and we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock under the plan at our discretion we may suspend the repurchase plan at any time 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we issued an aggregate of 470000 unregistered shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of approximately 168 million in separate transactions as partial consideration to acquire the businesses listed below for each transaction below the issuance of shares was exempt from registration under section 42 of the securities act of 1933 as amended because in each case there was no general solicitation and only a small number of stock recipients which were each sophisticated enough to evaluate the risks of the investment for each transaction we subsequently filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration statement on form s3 to register the resale of such shares 

 

   




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” on page 24 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures 

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks we are headquartered in itasca illinois have operations in 18 countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 140 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants we generate approximately 80 of our revenues domestically with the remaining 20 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada new zealand and the uk we have three reporting segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 73 22 and 5 respectively to 2012 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from our investment portfolio which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds as well as clean energy and other investments 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

overview and 2012 financial highlights 

even though we generated positive organic growth in the year ended december 31 2012 in both our brokerage and risk management segments the uncertain economic environment continued to provide headwinds for our business in 2012 in first quarter 2012 surveys by the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab indicated that commercial propertycasualty rates were up on average 44 across all sized accounts the second quarter report indicated that rates were up on average 43 across all sized accounts the third quarter report indicated that rates were up on average 39 across all sized accounts the fourth quarter report indicated that rates were up on average 50 across all sized accounts the ciab survey did not reveal any significant new emerging trends but did note that rates appear to be continuing the trend upward although competition is still stiff in the marketplace the fourth quarter survey indicated that propertycasualty insurance carriers appear to be tightening their underwriting standards particularly on accounts with poor loss experience the survey also indicated that there is some upward rate pressure on workers’ compensation and property lines of business however the demand for insurance continues to be restrained due to the sluggish economy which could offset the impact of the favorable pricing trend noted in the fourth quarter survey the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 80 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

our operating results improved in 2012 compared to 2011 in both our brokerage and risk management segments 

 

  

  

   

 in our corporate segment we made tremendous progress in rollingout our clean energy investments during 2012 and we now have most of our plants in various stages of ramping up production our clean energy investments contributed 327 million to net earnings in 2012 and could be more than double that in 2013 these additional earnings will be used to continue our mergers and acquisition strategy in our core brokerage and risk management operations 

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2012 revenues ebitdac and diluted net earnings loss per share with the same periods in 2011 

 

 we achieved these results by among other things demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy and generating organic growth in our core businesses in 2012 we continued to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth by the end of 2012 20 of our revenues were generated internationally compared with 19 in 2011 we expect this international revenue trend to continue in 2013 

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 

  

as markets harden certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

recent events 

in 2012 the insurance market began showing signs of “firming” as opposed to traditional “hardening” across many lines and geographic areas in this environment rates increased at a moderate pace clients could still obtain coverage businesses continued to stay in standardline markets and there was adequate capacity in the insurance market it is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the current economic environment despite the official end of the recession and recent signs of an economic recovery the deterioration in the economy that began in the fall of 2008 continued to adversely impact us in 2012 and could continue to do so in future years as a result of potential reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients may purchase due to reductions in among other things their headcount payroll properties and the market value of their assets such reductions could also adversely impact our commission revenues in future years if the propertycasualty insurance carriers perform exposure audits that lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy 

in june 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of portions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to together as the 2010 health care reform legislation the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation as a result the potential exists for our employee benefits consultants to win new clients and generate additional revenue from existing clients by assisting them in navigating the increasingly complex regulations surrounding their benefits plans in 2012 our employee benefits consulting operation generated approximately one quarter of the brokerage segment’s revenues although we believe that the 2010 health care reform legislation could be beneficial to our brokerage segment’s fee revenues given the legislation’s broad scope and the uncertainties that exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of many of the legislation’s complex provisions the potential impact of the legislation on us in the long run beneficial or otherwise is currently uncertain 

clean energy investments  in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod llc’s see below proprietary technologies we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

nineteen plants are under longterm production contracts with several utilities the remaining ten plants are in various stages of engineering negotiating finalizing and signing longterm production contracts several of the remaining ten plants could be in production starting in mid2013 with the balance expected to be in production in 2014 our current estimate of the 2013 annual aftertax earnings that could be generated from production at the plants that operate in 2013 is 750 million to 910 million if we continue to have success in entering additional longterm production contracts we could generate more aftertax earnings in 2014 and beyond 

we also own a 4654 controlling interest in chemmod llc which has been marketing the chemmod™ solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those plants in which we hold interests based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 36 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts typically we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of propertycasualty insurance policy transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit brokerage operations under these direct bill arrangements the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions that we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services that we provide over a period of time typically one year we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 

income taxes  our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return we evaluate our tax positions using a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position if a tax position does not meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

  

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses our primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements or trade names expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and ten to fifteen years for trade names while goodwill is not subject to amortization the establishment of goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods different estimates or assumptions could produce different results we carry intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 

we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2012 2011 and 2010 we wrote off 35 million 46 million and 23 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets related to prior year acquisitions of our brokerage segment the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted on a prospective basis revised guidance to account for our acquisitions including the estimation and recognition of the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions from 2009 and into the future whose purchase agreements contain such provisions subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred potential earnout obligations are typically based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired businesses for acquisitions made prior to january 1 2009 we did not include such obligations in the purchase price recorded for each applicable acquisition at the acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable we generally record future payments made under these 2008 and prior arrangements if any as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled which will have no impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated statement of earnings see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2012 business combinations 

business combinations and dispositions 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2012 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2012 2011 or 2010 historically we have used acquisitions to grow our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries we expect that our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions we intend to continue to consider from time to time additional acquisitions for our brokerage and risk management segments on terms that we deem advantageous at any particular time we are generally engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates however we can make no assurances that any additional acquisitions will be consummated or if consummated that they will be advantageous to us

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments adjusted revenues adjusted compensation and operating expenses adjusted compensation expense ratio adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information related to 

  

organic revenues and ebitdac although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided certain reclassifications have been made to the prioryear amounts reported in this report in order to conform them to the current year presentation 

adjusted presentation  we believe that the adjusted presentation of our 2012 2011 and 2010 information presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics of the company that will assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

 earnings measures  we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segment as defined below provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert and diluted net earnings per share as adjusted for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

organic revenues  organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition change in organic revenues excludes the impact of supplemental and contingent commission revenues and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation an disposed of operations the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same prior year periods for the risk management segment organic change in base domestic and international fees excludes international performance bonus fees and new zealand earthquake claims administration to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or due to the limitedtime nature of these revenue sources 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that will be continuing in 2013 and beyond we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments we also believe that using this measure allows financial statement users to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner

other information 

allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue headcount and other information we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were computing income tax provisions on a separate company basis as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our fifteen 2011 era plants we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 370 to 390 in both our brokerage segment and our risk management segment for the foreseeable future reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results pretax profit margin compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings from continuing operations divided by total revenues the compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues the operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 73 of our revenue from continuing operations in 2012 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

  

financial information relating to our brokerage segment results for 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions except per share percentages and workforce data 

 

   

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2012 ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac to the same periods in 2011 and 2011 ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac to the same periods in 2010 in millions 

 

 effective may 12 2011 we acquired hlg holdings ltd heath lambert for cash net of cash received of £997 million 1640 million as of the acquisition date prior to our acquisition of heath lambert it sold nearly all lines of propertycasualty and employee benefit insurance products through 1200 professionals in 16 offices throughout the uk subsequent to the acquisition date we have been integrating the heath lambert operations into our existing operations which has reduced the number of employees and offices involved with these acquired operations 

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when analyzing the impact of the heath lambert acquisition on our 2012 results we expect that it could take up to two years to fully integrate the heath lambert operations into our existing operations in millions 

 

 as expected until the integration process is completed in 2013 the heath lambert operations will reduce the overall brokerage segment adjusted ebitdac margins heath lambert’s current operating structure tends to produce lower compensation expense ratios and higher operating expense ratios in comparison to our other nonheath lambert related brokerage operations 

our adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert was 229 and 224 for 2012 and 2011 respectively our adjusted ebitdac margin was 227 for 2012 and 220 for 2011 respectively 

commissions and fees  the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2012 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2012 2001 million commissions and fees in 2012 included new business production and renewal rate increases of 2057 million which was offset by lost business of 1516 million the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2011 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2011 1844 million commissions and fees in 2011 included new business production of 1689 million which was offset by renewal decreases and lost business of 1340 million the organic change in commission and fee revenues was 4 in 2012 3 in 2011 and 2 in 2010 the organic change in commission fee and supplemental commission revenues was 4 in 2012 3 in 2011 and 2 in 2010 commission revenues increased 16 and fee revenues increased 24 in 2012 compared to 2011 commission revenues increased 18 and fee revenues increased 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

items excluded from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for 2012 2011 and 2010 include the following in millions 

 

 supplemental and contingent commissions  reported supplemental and contingent commission revenues recognized in 2012 2011 2010 and 2009 by quarter are shown in the table below as previously disclosed many insurance carriers have provided sufficient information for us to recognize supplemental commission revenues on a quarterly basis for a majority of our 2012 2011 and 2010 supplemental commission arrangements however in 2009 and prior years most carriers only provided this information on an annual basis after the end of the contract period accordingly the 2010 amounts reported in the table below include both a full year of 2009 supplemental commission revenues and 2010 supplemental commission revenues that were recognized by us on a quarterly basis this situation did not occur in 2011 and should not occur in 2013 or later years as we anticipate that most of the carriers will continue to provide information on a quarterly basis sufficient to allow recognition of revenues in a similar manner in future quarters 

to assist in comparing 2010 to 2009 the supplemental commission timing line in the organic revenue tables above adjusts the 2009 revenue as if we had been receiving the information from the carriers and recognizing the quarterly supplemental commissions in 2009 on the same basis as in 2010 

  

an analysis of supplemental and contingent commission revenues recognized in 2012 2011 2010 and 2009 by quarter is as follows in millions

compensation expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2012 compensation expense with the same periods in 2011 and 2011 compensation expense with the same periods in 2010 in millions 

 

 the increase in compensation expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1242 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 249 million severance related costs 111 million stock compensation expense 88 million and temporary staffing 12 million 

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the earnout compensation charge 70 million discussed below the increase in employee headcount in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2012 and new production hires 

the increase in compensation expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1381 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 173 million and the 70 million earnout compensation charge discussed below 

these increases were partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense 84 million and severance related costs 27 million the increase in employee headcount in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2011 and new production hires 

during 2011 we recognized 70 million of compensation expense for an earnout obligation related to a prior year acquisition pursuant to asc subtopic 805105525 formerly eitf 958 the portion of the earnout obligation that will be paid to our existing employees by the sellers once the earnout is settled must be recorded as compensation expense in our statement of earnings 

operating expense  the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing 2012 operating expense with the same periods in 2011 and 2011 operating expense with the same periods in 2010 in millions 

 

 the increase in operating expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to an unfavorable foreign currency translation 16 million and increases in professional fees 171 million office expense 110 million sales development expense 46 million travel and entertainment expense 44 million net rent and utilities 43 million licenses and fees 32 million other expense 12 million bad debt expense 08 million and lease termination charges of 06 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2012 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in business insurance 33 million 

  

the increase in operating expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to increases in office expense 118 million professional fees 101 million net rent and utilities 87 million travel and entertainment expense 67 million business insurance 42 million licenses and fees 42 million sales development expense 25 million and other expense 05 million also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2011 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a favorable foreign currency translation 09 million and decreases in litigation settlement expense 35 million bad debt expense 06 million and lease termination charges 05 million 

depreciation  the increases in depreciation expense in 2012 compared to 2011 and in 2011 compared to 2010 were due primarily to the purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2012 2011 and 2010 were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years 

amortization  the increases in amortization in 2012 compared to 2011 and in 2011 compared to 2010 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for noncompete agreements and ten years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews in 2012 2011 and 2010 we wrote off 34 million 46 million and 23 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the increase in expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2012 compared to 2011 and the increase in income from the change in estimated earnout payables in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2012 2011 and 2010 we recognized 93 million 83 million and 62 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2012 2011 and 2010 acquisitions during 2012 2011 and 2010 we recognized 57 million 145 million and 88 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 45 22 and 11 acquisitions respectively 

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2012 2011 and 2010 acquisitions are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability revenue growth rates generally ranged from 10 to 12 for our 2012 acquisitions we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income 

the income generated from the net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to our acquisition of the policy renewal rights from liberty mutual and the wausau signature agency which we refer to as liberty mutual in february 2009 as part of this transaction we acquired over 250 producers account managers and service staff from liberty mutual due to the underlying market conditions existing in early 2009 at the date of the transaction a deteriorating economy and uncertainty of when it would recover and the significant uncertainties related to this transaction that could affect the performance of the liberty mutual business we purchased the policy renewal rights related to liberty mutual’s middlemarket commercial pc business located in their midwest and southeast regions as opposed to buying a standalone brokerage agency a portion of the liberty business was cobrokered the extent of which was not known by liberty mutual at the time of the acquisition and the risks associated with moving captive agents to an open brokerage environment we structured this acquisition such that approximately 70 of the maximum purchase price was based on a three year earnout period we paid approximately 450 million as of the acquisition date with a potential maximum earnout payable of up to 1200 million to be paid in second quarter 2012 as of the acquisition date we initially estimated and recorded an earnout payable of approximately 640 million based on financial projections that incorporated assumptions to address the risks noted above we monitored and updated the financial projections for this business using actual results during the earnout period and made adjustments to the recorded earnout payable when applicable during 2011 and 2012 we had seen some deterioration in client retention related to this business primarily due to cobrokered business and had been rationalizing staffing levels which resulted in downward adjustments to our estimated financial projections and a decrease in the recorded earnout payable in both 2011 and 2012 in august 2012 we paid out 324 million 248 million in our common stock and 76 million in cash to liberty mutual related to this earnout obligation 

provision for income taxes  the brokerage segment’s effective tax rate in 2012 2011 and 2010 was 398 387 and 393 respectively we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 370 to 400 in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future

 revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

   

the increase in 2012 is due primarily to increased production from the leased facilities the decrease in 2011 is due to our consolidation of the 2009 era plants in 2010 until we sold portions of our ownership in twelve of these plants as of march 1 2010 at that time we became noncontrolling minority investors and now account for these investments using equity method accounting 

 

 the increase in royalty income in 2012 was due to a substantial increase in the production of refined coal by chemmod’s licensees there was a lesser amount of production of refined coal by chemmod’s licensees in 2011 and 2010 

expenses related to royalty income of chemmod were 165 million 32 million and 22 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively which include noncontrolling interest of 146 million 17 million and 12 million respectively 

 

 the increased pretax loss in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to increased production which generates increased pretax operating losses the increased pretax loss in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the nine high volume production plants incurring fixed expenses during the period that they were not producing refined coal in 2011 and as a result we were not earning production based income during that same time period only three low volume plants were in production during the first seven months of 2011 production at the nine high volume plants did not start until august 5 2011 after they received permanent operating permits

clean energy investments  we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants which produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chemmod we believe that these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 the fourteen plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2009 which we refer to as the 2009 era plants can receive tax credits through 2019 and the fifteen plants which were placed in service prior to december 31 2011 which we refer to as the 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton based on market prices reaches certain levels as follows 

 

  

 see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments 

discontinued operations 

in 2008 we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business in 2009 we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations under the agreement we transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer also in 2009 we recorded 35 million in lease termination and other real estate costs while winding down the remaining leased facilities of the reinsurance brokerage operations in addition we wrote off 45 million in receivables in 2009 related to the potential additional contingent proceeds from the initial sale transactions that were recognized in 2008 

in 2010 as part of integrating the operations of a londonbased insurance brokerage firm acquired by us on april 1 2010 and other real estate consolidation initiatives we restored into service certain leased real estate space that was abandoned in 2008 as part of the winddown of certain of our discontinued operations we recognized 32 million of pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily related to the reversal of a portion of the lease abandonment charges incurred in 2008 due to the irs completing its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years in fourth quarter 2010 we also recognized 85 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in our 2010 provision for income taxes related to discontinued operations 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet our cash requirements we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future to fund acquisitions made during 2012 and 2011 we relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement in addition for acquisitions made in 2012 we used proceeds from the 500 million note purchase agreement we entered into on july 10 2012 and for acquisitions made in 2011 we used proceeds from the 1250 million note purchase agreement we entered into on february 10 2011 

cash provided by operating activities was 3430 million 2840 million and 2295 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and realization of other current assets and an increased amount of noncash charges in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of fiduciary funds and in the payment of accrued liabilities and to an increased amount of noncash charges in 2011 compared to 2010 our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings from continuing operations as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows consolidated ebitdac was 4321 million and 3576 million for 2012 and 2011 we believe that these items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa currently imposes a minimum funding requirements for our plan we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2012 plan year the minimum funding requirement under the irc was 03 million in both 2011 and 2010 this level of required funding is based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2012 2011 and 2010 we made discretionary contributions to the plan of 72 million 72 million and 65 million respectively we are considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2013 and may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the plan in future periods see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates in 2012 the funded status of the plans was significantly impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2012 resulted in a 249 million increase in the benefit obligation at december 31 2012 however almost fully offsetting this impact was favorable returns on the plan’s assets in 2012 which combined with the 72 million of discretionary contributions made to the plan in 2012 resulted in an increase in the plan’s invested assets of 245 million at december 31 2012 the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2012 resulted in virtually no change in noncurrent liabilities in 2012 while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2012 2011 or 2010 potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 510 million 459 million and 251 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in 2013 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 800 million primarily related 

  

to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment the increase in net capital expenditures in 2012 from 2011 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2012 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 3441 million 2648 million and 801 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase use of cash for acquisitions made in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in the number of acquisition that occurred in 2012 the increased use of cash for acquisitions made in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the increase in the number of acquisitions made and the 1640 million of net cash paid for the heath lambert acquisition in addition during 2012 2011 and 2010 we issued 60 million shares 2036 million 32 million shares 906 million and 30 million shares 794 million respectively of our common stock as consideration paid for acquisitions we completed 60 32 and 19 acquisitions in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively annualized revenues of entities acquired in 2012 2011 and 2010 totaled approximately 2317 million 2770 million and 1451 million respectively in 2013 we expect to fund our acquisitions primarily using debt and cash from operations although we may still use our common stock on occasion for example to effect a taxfree exchange or if our overall acquisition activity warrants it 

during 2012 we issued 425000 shares of our common stock and paid 35 million in cash related to earnout obligations of five acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 01 million during 2011 we issued 245000 shares of our common stock paid 82 million in cash and accrued 183 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 19 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 300 million during 2010 we issued 12 million shares of our common stock paid 59 million in cash and accrued 40 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 25 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 267 million 

dispositions  during 2008 we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business under the agreements we received initial proceeds of 331 million and potential additional proceeds of up to 146 million in first quarter 2009 we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations under the agreement we transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 39 million 55 million and 59 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 114 million 140 million and 32 million related to these transactions offsetting the onetime gains related to sales of books of business in 2012 was a noncash loss of 35 million recognized in second quarter 2012 related to our acquisition of an additional 415 equity interest in cgm gallagher group limited which we refer to as cgm which increased our ownership in cgm to 80 the loss represents the decrease in fair value of our initial 385 equity interest in cgm based on the purchase price paid to acquire the additional 415 equity interest in cgm 

clean energy investments  during the period from 2009 through 2012 we made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 these irc section 45 tax credits create positive cash flow for us by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay during the period from 2009 through 2012 these investments in clean energy operations have produced only modest positive cash flow for us due to the capital expenditures we incurred during that period in 2013 and possibly continuing into 2014 we will incur additional capital expenditures related to the redeployment and in some cases movement of some of the refined coal plants we anticipate that the net cash flow related to the tax credits we can use in 2013 which will be partially offset by the related capital expenditures and in 2014 as well if capital expenditures continue into 2014 will be significantly positive our current estimate of the 2013 annual aftertax earnings that could be generated from production at the plants that operate in 2013 is 750 million to 910 million with the expected increased earnings from the irc section 45 investments in 2015 through 2021 and the minimal capital expenditures during that same period we anticipate that there will be even more annual positive net cash flow for us than in 2013 and 2014 we anticipate that this favorable impact on the amount we will pay the irs in 2013 and in future years from irc section 45 investments will allow us to use these positive cash flows to fund acquisitions please see “clean energy investments” beginning on page 38 for a more detailed description of these investments including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties 

cash flows from financing activities 

on july 15 2010 we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on july 14 2014 with a group of twelve financial institutions 

our credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to 5000 million of which up to 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 500 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 6000 million 

in 2007 2009 2011 and 2012 we entered into separate note purchase agreements with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors 4000 million 1500 million 1250 million and 500 million in aggregate debt respectively totaling 7250 million which was outstanding at december 31 2012 and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 3021 million we also use our credit agreement from time to time to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement there were 1290 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2012 due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit 3551 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2012 

  

during 2012 we borrowed 3030 million and repaid 1840 million under our credit agreement principal uses of the 2012 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2011 we borrowed 1510 million and repaid 1410 million under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2011 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2010 we borrowed and repaid 480 million under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2010 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes 

we are currently in the process of securing an additional 2000 million of longterm debt to fund acquisitions which we expect to close by mid 2013 

the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2012 

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors declares dividends on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2012 we declared 1675 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 136 per common share on december 20 2012 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 34 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 3 2012 this fourth quarter 2012 dividend schedule which was a change from our historical schedule to stockholder of record and payable dates resulted in five dividends being paid in 2012 for total dividend payments of 2044 million we anticipate that our stockholder of record and payable dates in future quarters will follow a similar schedule as the new fourth quarter 2012 payment dividend schedule which would result in four quarterly dividends in 2013 on january 24 2013 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2013 of 35 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 35 per common share throughout 2013 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2013 of approximately 1752 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2012 or a decrease in cash used of approximately 292 million this decrease in cash used is primarily the result of five dividend payments being made in 2012 compared to four payments that will be made in 2013 we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors we did not repurchase any shares in 2012 2011 and 2010 we generally hold repurchased shares for reissuance in connection with our equity compensation and stock option plans under the provisions of the repurchase plan we were authorized to repurchase approximately 10000000 additional shares at december 31 2012 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources the common stock repurchases reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2012 2011 and 2010 include 82000 shares at a cost of 15 million 41000 shares at a cost of 12 million and 32000 shares at a cost of 08 million respectively that we repurchased from our employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years under these circumstances we withhold the proceeds from the repurchases and remit them to the taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 823 million in 2012 739 million in 2011 and 367 million in 2010 prior to 2009 we issued stock options under four stock optionbased employee compensation plans the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of 10 per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant in may 2008 all of these plans expired on may 10 2011 our stockholders approved the 2011 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2009 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 100 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip  09 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2012 in addition we have an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in 2012 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 

shelf registration statement  on may 5 2010 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock as previously disclosed we have used this registration statement to register for resale shares of our common stock issued as acquisition consideration but we have not issued any shares under this registration statement the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we can make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any shares under this registration statement 

  

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs except for 2008 and 2005 our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac have increased year over year since 1991 in 2008 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations severance litigation impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation in 2005 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations we expect the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted for noncash items to continue in the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions additionally we anticipate a favorable impact on the amount we will pay the irs in 2013 and in future years based on anticipated tax credits from irc section 45 investments we also anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under the credit agreement described below under “cash flows from financing activities” and our common stock to fund acquisitions in addition we may from time to time consider other alternatives for longerterm funding sources such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings equity markets or restructuring our operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business or if our acquisition program accelerates significantly 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 6 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments including interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2012 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 67 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

note purchase agreements  on august 3 2007 we entered into a note purchase agreement as amended and restated on december 19 2007 with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 1000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 626 senior notes series a due august 3 2014 and 3000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 644 senior notes series b due august 3 2017 in a private placement 

on november 30 2009 we entered into a note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 1500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 585 senior notes series c due in three equal installments on november 30 2016 november 30 2018 and november 30 2019 in a private placement 

on february 10 2011 we entered into a note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 750 million in aggregate principal amount of our 518 senior notes series d due february 10 2021 and 500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 549 senior notes series e due february 10 2023 in a private placement 

on july 10 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 399 senior notes series f due july 10 2020 in a private placement see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements 

  

credit agreement  we have a 5000 million credit agreement which expires on july 14 2014 with a group of twelve financial institutions we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time at december 31 2012 159 million of letters of credit for which we have 85 million of liabilities recorded at december 31 2012 were outstanding under the credit agreement there were 1290 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2012 accordingly at december 31 2012 3551 million remained available for potential borrowings of which 591 million may be in the form of additional letters of credit we are under no obligation to use the credit agreement in performing our normal business operations see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 

operating lease obligations  we generally operate in leased premises at our other locations certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 

we have leased certain office space to several nonaffiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements in the normal course of business we expect that the leases will not be renewed or replaced we adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 

outstanding purchase obligations  as a service company we typically do not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we have outstanding as of december 31 2012 these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31 2012 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 248 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our 2009 to 2012 acquisitions that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the aggregate amount of the maximum potential earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 3848 million of which 1398 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for using the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2012 and 2011 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2012 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 102 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 85 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2012 we had posted 57 million of letters of credit to allow the rentacaptive facility to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2012 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our portfolio of cash and our cash equivalents as of december 31 2012 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2012 

we have other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions which can change rapidly in addition some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from us a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if we elect to withdraw financial or operational support 

as of december 31 2012 we had 7250 million of borrowings outstanding under our various note purchase agreements the aggregate estimated fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2012 was 8167 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate an allin interest rate for discounting we obtained market quotes for notes with the same terms as ours which we have deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates we have not adjusted this rate for risk profile changes covenant issues or credit rating changes we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2012 and the resulting fair values would be 330 million higher than their carrying value or 7580 million 

as of december 31 2012 we had 1290 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2012 and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying value 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from one of our larger uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incurs expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of its revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian canadian indian jamaican singaporean and various caribbean operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2012 a weakening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would decrease by approximately 43 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2012 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately 80 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars however it is management’s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to our consolidated operating results or financial position we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2012 2011 and 2010 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency disbursements through various future payment dates in addition during 2012 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates these hedging strategies are designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements but we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of our payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2012 2011 and 2010 see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in comprehensive earnings in 2012 2011 and 2010

operating segments 

we report our results in three segments brokerage risk management and corporate the major sources of our operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations information with respect to all sources of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 is as follows in millions 

 

 see note 17 to our 2011 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information including earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commission and fee revenues and the related brokerage and marketing expenses can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers on the other the hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions and recognition of investment gains and losses also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 16 to our 2011 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2011 and 2010 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 73 of our revenue from continuing operations in 2011 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance carriers which are usually based upon either a percentage of the premium paid by insureds or brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker by the insurer commission rates depend on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees paid to us by our clients depend on the extent and value of the services we provide in addition under certain circumstances we receive supplemental and contingent commissions for both retail and wholesale brokerage services a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid the insurance carrier determines the supplemental commission that is eligible to be paid annually based on historical performance criteria in advance of the contractual period a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

we operate our brokerage operations through a network of more than 300 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 16 other countries most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel in addition we offer clientservice capabilities in more than 110 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 78 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2011 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows 

 

 our retail brokerage operations are organized in more than 190 geographical profit centers located in the us australia canada and uk and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 67 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups we serve are as follows 

 

   

our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries or business segments we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

 

  

  

  

 wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 22 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2011 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance these brokers operate through over 65 geographical profit centers located across the us bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer’s business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing underwriting although we do not assume any underwriting risk issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

over 75 of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as the largest domestic managing general agentunderwriting manager according to business insurance magazine’s october 10 2011 edition 

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients and developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 26 of our revenues from continuing operations in 2011 our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments approximately 67 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers compensation related claims 26 are from general and commercial auto liability related claims and 7 are from property related claims in addition we generate revenues from integrated disability management employee absence management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed 

risk management services are primarily marketed directly to fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies notforprofit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of approximately 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients and customers 

while this segment complements our insurance brokerage offerings over 86 of our risk management segment’s revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers such as insurance companies and clients of other insurance brokers based on revenues our risk management operation ranked as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party claims administrator according to business insurance magazine’s march 28 2011 edition 

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from increased levels of business with fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies captives program business and the outsourcing of insurance company claims departments in addition the risk management segment may grow in the future through mergers and acquisitions 

  

corporate segment 

the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt clean energy investments external acquisitionrelated expenses and other corporate costs we have been winding down our legacy investments since 2003 at december 31 2011 significant investments managed by this segment include 

clean coal related ventures 

we have a 420 interest in a privatelyheld enterprise chemmod llc that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions at coalfired power plants we also have an 80 interest in a privatelyheld startup enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels 

taxadvantaged investments 

prior to january 1 2008 we owned certain partnerships formed to develop energy that qualified for tax credits under the former irc section 29 these consisted of wastetoenergy partnerships and synthetic coal operations these investments helped to substantially reduce our effective income tax rate from 2002 through 2007 the law that permitted us to claim irc section 29 tax credits expired on december 31 2007 in 2009 and 2011 we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chemmod’s technologies we believe these operations will produce refined coal that will qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires on december 31 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 2009 era plants and december 31 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011 2011 era plants 

international operations 

our total revenues by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 were as follows in millions 

 

 see notes 5 14 and 17 to our 2011 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2011 2010 and 2009 

brokerage operations in australia bermuda canada and the uk 

the majority of our international brokerage operations are in australia bermuda canada and the uk 

we operate in australia and canada primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker in the uk we also have a retail brokerage and underwriting operation for clients to access the lloyd’s of london and other international insurance markets and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities in bermuda we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies 

we also have ownership interests in two bermudabased insurance companies that operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities these facilities enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive insurance companies are created for clients to insure their risks and capture underwriting profit and investment income which is then available for use by the insureds generally for reducing future costs of their insurance programs 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 110 countries we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area 

risk management operations in australia canada new zealand and the uk 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the us and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

  

markets and marketing 

we manage our brokerage operations through a network of more than 300 sales and service offices located throughout the us and in 16 other countries we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of 110 offices located throughout the us australia canada new zealand and the uk our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2011 our largest single customer accounted for approximately 2 of total revenues and our ten largest customers represented 6 of total revenues in the aggregate our revenues are geographically diversified with both domestic and international operations 

each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small marketshare position and as a result we believe has substantial organic growth potential in addition each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small to mediumsized independent brokerages see “business combinations” below 

while historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically and we expect to continue to do so from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment 

we require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities including all of our executive officers to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 18 2011 edition we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with aon corporation marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis group holdings ltd each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as wells fargo insurance services inc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients in addition for healthwelfare products and benefit consultant services we compete with larger firms such as aon hewitt mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc towers watson  co and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies 

our wholesale brokerage operations compete with large wholesalers such as crump group inc crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc swett  crawford group inc as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers 

we also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party administrator based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s march 28 2011 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company and esis a subsidiary of ace limited several large insurance companies such as aig insurance and zurich insurance also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors particularly during the softening insurance cycle in addition we compete with various smaller third party administrators on a regional level we believe that our competitive position is due to our strong reputation for outstanding service and our ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most costefficient manner possible 

regulation 

we are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business in addition most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities be personally licensed these licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in most jurisdictions licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities 

  

business combinations 

we completed and integrated 286 acquisitions from january 1 1985 through december 31 2011 almost exclusively within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local propertycasualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas over the last decade we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas acquisition prices typically fall within the 1 million to 50 million purchase price range 

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business generally 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example for several years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market this put downward pressure on our commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas beginning in late 2000 the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing because of the events of september 11 th  many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased in some cases dramatically beginning in late 2003 the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas while the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to become rate and price sensitive once again the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines since that time even though there was a higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

  

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

a continuation or worsening of the recent economic recession may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the general deterioration in the economy which began in fourth quarter 2008 could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact our 2012 commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our client overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability the failure of an insurer with whom we places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by our clients which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies we may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations 

in the past several years we have completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in us achieving slower growth moreover even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows us to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions our acquisitions pose the risk of 

  

postacquisition deterioration which could result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges additionally we may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with our acquisitions these could include liabilities relating to accounting information technology human resources and regulatory or compliance issues including for example liabilities relating to violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws when we acquire businesses with international operations if any of these developments occur our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the us 

we conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the us including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries for example we use thirdparty service providers located in india for certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations or ability to use thirdparty providers in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

operating outside the us may also present other risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the us these include among others risk relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations 

our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including the risk that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations 

a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume andor growth thresholds andor insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent commissions andor supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools our client relationships growth strategy compliance programs and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards client preferences and internal control standards we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships growth strategy compliance programs and operating results 

our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster material cybersecurity attack or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located for example our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risxfacs ®  our proprietary risk management information system to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services disruptions could be caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics material cybersecurity attacks or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies however such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

  

regulatory legal and accounting risks 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable 

many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision including insurance industry regulation federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate including the financial services authority in the uk the fsa failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in all such cases we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business for example although our inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois ended on october 1 2009 compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public state attorneys general and state insurance departments this could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice if this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 health care reform legislation 

during march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act together the 2010 health care reform legislation were signed into law the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements we are subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business and otherwise adversely affect our financial results 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws 

the fcpa uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials our training program and policies mandate compliance with the fcpa uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in recent years two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the uk by the fsa and one was investigated in the us by the sec and department of justice for improper payments to foreign officials these firms paid 

  

significant settlements and undertook internal investigations if we are found to be liable for violations of anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our third party partners or agents we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information such as through a cybersecurity attack nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue we recently experienced an attempt to wrongfully access our computer and information systems which if successful could have resulted in harm to our business our systems were successful in identifying the risk and preventing unauthorized access and management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations however there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents that could have a material impact on our business will not occur 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations that sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services and may be more stringent in some jurisdictions outside the us our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage our reputation 

significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

risks relating to our investments debt and common stock 

our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments our ability to take full advantage of our proportionate share of the tax credits generated by these operations is subject to various risks and uncertainties these include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties as set forth below 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals such laws and regulations also impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise involved in the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using the chemmod™ solution in a number of ways including air emissions waste water and byproducts such as fly ash one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chem mod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution for example we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage diminution of property or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related limited liability companies in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment 

our corporate segment holds a variety of investments these investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation tax audits and disputes failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments 

the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all 

economic financial and industry conditions beyond our control may affect our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our debt the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under such agreements to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities should we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in our company 

volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders 

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures and other” on page 23 for a reconciliation of the nongaap measures for adjusted total revenues organic commission fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures as well as other important information regarding these measures 

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks we are headquartered in itasca illinois have operations in 17 countries and offer clientservice capabilities in more than 110 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants we generate approximately 81 of our revenues domestically with the remaining 19 derived internationally primarily in australia bermuda canada new zealand and the uk we have three reporting segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 73 26 and 1 respectively to 2011 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from our investment portfolio which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds as well as clean energy and other investments 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

overview and 2011 financial highlights 

even though we generated positive organic growth in the year ended december 31 2011 in both our brokerage and risk management segments the uncertain economic environment continued to provide headwinds for our business in 2011 in first quarter 2011 surveys by the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab indicated that commercial propertycasualty rates had again declined for the 29th consecutive quarter although the rate of decrease slowed from that reported in fourth quarter 2010 the second quarter report indicated that rates remained stable with negligible declines the third quarter report indicated that rates were up on average 09 across all sized accounts with small accounts leading the way with an average 21 increase the fourth quarter report indicated that rates were up on average 28 across all sized accounts with medium accounts leading the way with an average 35 increase the ciab survey did not reveal any significant new emerging trends but did note that rates appear to be moving towards positive territory although competition is still stiff in the marketplace the fourth quarter survey indicated that propertycasualty insurance carriers appear to be tightening their underwriting standards particularly on accounts with poor loss experience the survey also indicated that there is some upward rate pressure on workers’ compensation and property lines of business however the demand for insurance continues to be restrained due to the sluggish economy which could offset the impact of the favorable pricing trend noted in the fourth quarter survey the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 80 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the us 

despite these headwinds our operating results improved in 2011 compared to 2010 in both our brokerage and risk management segments 

 

  

  

 we achieved these results by demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy and generating organic growth in our core businesses in 2011 we continued to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth by the end of 2011 19 of our revenues were generated internationally compared with 13 in 2010 we expect this international revenue trend to continue in 2012 

  

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 

as markets harden certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

recent events 

the deterioration in the economy that began in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted us in 2011 and could continue to do so in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in among other things their headcount payroll properties and the market value of their assets such reductions could also adversely impact our commission revenues in future years if the propertycasualty insurance carriers perform exposure audits that lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to together as the 2010 health care reform legislation were signed into law the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation as a result the potential exists for our employee benefits consultants to win new clients and generate additional revenue from existing clients by assisting them in navigating the increasingly complex regulations surrounding their benefits plans in 2011 our employee benefits consulting operation generated approximately one quarter of the brokerage segment’s revenues although we believe that the 2010 health care reform legislation could be beneficial to our brokerage segment’s fee revenues given the legislation’s broad scope and the uncertainties that exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of many of the legislation’s complex provisions the potential impact of the legislation on us beneficial or otherwise is currently uncertain 

clean energy investments  in 2009 we built and placed in service fourteen commercial clean coal production plants 2009 era plants at december 31 2011 we held noncontrolling minority interests in five limited liability companies that own twelve of the 2009 era plants these plants are currently producing refined coal using chemmod llc’s technologies see below which reduce harmful emissions and that we believe qualify for irc section 45 tax credits collectively these twelve plants’ operations could generate for us approximately 43 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter through 2019 

at december 31 2011 we also held a controlling majority interest in a limited liability company that owns two 2009 era plants while these plants have produced refined coal using chemmod’s technologies in the past they are currently idle 

congress extended the deadline for clean coal production plants to be “placed in service” by two years from december 31 2009 to december 31 2011 tax credits on these plants can be earned for ten years from the placedinservice date if the clean coal production plants are placed in service by december 31 2011 in conjunction with this extension and the marketing efforts of chemmod there is increased demand for irc section 45 projects and the chemmod technologies accordingly we have invested 334 million in fifteen commercial clean coal production plants that we placed in service producing refined coal using chemmod’s technologies prior to december 31 2011 2011 era plants 

  

at december 31 2011 we held controlling majority interests in seven limited liability companies that own the fifteen 2011 era plants as of january 1 2012 we sold majority portions of our investments in six limited liability companies that own five of the plants for a total of 129 million these plants are currently producing refined coal under longterm purchase commitments with utilities collectively these five plants could generate for us approximately 80 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter through 2021 

we continue to seek and negotiate longterm purchase commitments for the remaining ten 2011 era plants all of which are currently idle we have nonbinding agreements in principle with a utility and coinvestors for one of the 2011 era plants however these transactions are not expected to close and the related production of refined coal at this utility is not expected to begin until approximately second quarter of 2012 this plant could generate for us approximately 17 million of aftertax earnings per quarter through 2021 it is too early at this time to predict when negotiations and transactions will be complete and what the ultimate earnings potential will be from the remaining nine plants not currently under longterm purchase commitments 

ultimately we plan to sell majority ownership interests in all fifteen 2011 era plants and relinquish control of the plants under structures similar to the 2009 era plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor 

we also own a 42 controlling interest in chemmod llc which has been marketing its chemmod™ solution technologies principally to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those utilities that are operating with the irc section 45 clean coal production plants in which we hold investments to date permits to utilize chemmod’s technologies have been permitted for coalfired utilities in twelve states several other states are in the process of granting similar approvals although we cannot predict the timing of such approvals or whether such approvals will be granted based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 25 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

all estimates set forth above regarding the future quarterly earnings impact of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts typically we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of propertycasualty transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit brokerage operations under these direct bill arrangements the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions that we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services that we provide over a period of time typically one year we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 

  

income taxes  our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return we evaluate our tax positions using a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position if a tax position does not meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses our primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements or trade names expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists three to five years for noncompete agreements and ten to fifteen years for trade names while goodwill is not subject to amortization the establishment of goodwill expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods different estimates or assumptions could produce different results we carry intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 

we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2011 and 2010 we wrote off 46 million and 23 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets related to prior year acquisitions of our brokerage segment no such indicators were noted in 2009 the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted on a prospective basis revised guidance to account for our acquisitions including the estimation and recognition of the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions from 2009 and into the future whose purchase agreements contain such provisions subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred potential earnout 

  

obligations are typically based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired businesses for acquisitions made prior to january 1 2009 we did not include such obligations in the purchase price recorded for each applicable acquisition at the acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable we generally record future payments made under these 2008 and prior arrangements if any as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled which will have no impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated statement of earnings see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2011 business combinations 

business combinations and dispositions 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2011 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2011 2010 or 2009 historically we have used acquisitions to grow our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries we expect that our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions we intend to continue to consider from time to time additional acquisitions for our brokerage and risk management segments on terms that we deem advantageous at any particular time we are generally engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates however we can make no assurances that any additional acquisitions will be consummated or if consummated that they will be advantageous to us

adjusted presentation  we believe that the adjusted presentation of our 2011 2010 and 2009 statements of earnings presented on the following pages provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain of our financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us the aftertax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

 earnings measures   we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share as adjusted provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share as adjusted are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 organic revenues   organic change in commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the change in organic revenues associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition change in organic revenues excludes the impact of supplemental and contingent commission revenues and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same prior year periods

other information 

allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue headcount and other information we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were computing income tax provisions on a separate company basis as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated in 2011 because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 credits expires on december 31 2021 for our related investments we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 380 to 400 in both our brokerage segment and our risk management segment for the foreseeable future reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results pretax profit margin compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings from continuing operations divided by total revenues the compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues the operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues 

brokerage 

the brokerage segment accounted for 73 of our revenue from continuing operations in 2011 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

  

the following two tables provide gaap reported and nongaap information see page 23 and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure that management believes is helpful when comparing brokerage segment results for 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions except per share percentage and workforce data 

 

   

 

   

effective may 12 2011 we acquired hlg holdings ltd heath lambert for cash net of cash received of £997 million 1640 million as of the acquisition date heath lambert sells nearly all lines of propertycasualty and employee benefit insurance products through 1200 professionals in 16 offices throughout the uk the transaction is expected to generate approximately 1450 million to 1550 million in annualized revenue 

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when analyzing the impact of the heath lambert acquisition on our 2011 results we expect that it could take up to two years to fully integrate the heath lambert operations into our existing operations in millions 

 

 as expected until the integration process is completed in 2013 the heath lambert operations will reduce the overall brokerage segment adjusted ebitdac margins heath lambert’s current operating structure tends to produce lower compensation expense ratios and higher operating expense ratios in comparison to our other nonheath lambert related brokerage operations 

our adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert was 224 for 2011 our adjusted ebitdac margin was 219 and 220 for 2010 and 2009 respectively 

commissions and fees  the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2011 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2011 1844 million commissions and fees in 2011 included new business production of 1689 million which was offset by renewal decreases and lost business of 1340 million the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2010 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2010 579 million commissions and fees in 2010 included new business production of 1413 million which was offset by renewal decreases and lost business of 1620 million the organic change in commission and fee revenues was 3 in 2011 2 in 2010 and 3 in 2009 the organic change in commission fee and supplemental commission revenues was 3 in 2011 and 2 in 2010 and 2009 commission revenues increased 18 and fee revenues increased 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 commission revenues increased 5 and fee revenues decreased 3 in 2010 compared to 2009 

  

items excluded from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for 2011 2010 and 2009 include the following in millions 

 

 supplemental and contingent commissions  reported supplemental and contingent commission revenues recognized in 2011 2010 and 2009 by quarter are shown in the table below as previously disclosed many insurance carriers have provided sufficient information for us to recognize supplemental commission revenues on a quarterly basis for a majority of our 2011 and 2010 supplemental commission arrangements however in 2009 and prior years most carriers only provided this information on an annual basis after the end of the contract period accordingly the 2010 amounts reported in the table below include both a full year of 2009 supplemental commission revenues and 2010 supplemental commission revenues that were recognized by us on a quarterly basis this situation did not occur in 2011 and should not occur in 2012 or later years as we anticipate that most of the carriers will continue to provide information on a quarterly basis sufficient to allow recognition of revenues in a similar manner in future quarters 

to assist in comparing 2010 to 2009 the supplemental commission timing line in the organic revenue tables above adjusts the 2009 revenue as if we had been receiving the information from the carriers and recognizing the quarterly supplemental commissions in 2009 on the same basis as in 2010 

  

an analysis of supplemental and contingent commission revenues recognized in 2011 2010 2009 and 2008 by quarter is as follows in millions 

 

 investment income and gains realized on books of business sales  this primarily represents interest income earned on cash cash equivalents and restricted funds and onetime gains related to sales of books of business investment income in 2011 remained relatively unchanged compared to 2010 and 2009 in 2010 we recognized a 27 million gain related to our acquisition of the remaining 60 equity interest in specialised broking associates pty ltd which we refer to as sba we previously had a 40 equity interest in sba with the option to increase our ownership to 100 the gain represented the increase in fair value of our original 40 equity interest in sba based on the purchase price paid for the remaining 60 equity interest onetime gains related to sales of books of business in 2011 2010 and 2009 were 55 million 59 million and 116 million respectively the decrease in onetime gains related to sales of books of business in 2011 and 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the unusually high level of disposition activity that occurred in 2009 

compensation expense  the increase in compensation expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 1381 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 173 million the 70 million earnout compensation charge discussed below 

  

these increases were partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense 84 million and severance related costs 27 million the increase in employee headcount in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2011 and new production hires 

during 2011 we recognized 70 million of compensation expense for an earnout obligation related to a prior year acquisition pursuant to asc subtopic 805105525 formerly eitf 958 the portion of the earnout obligation that will be paid to our existing employees by the sellers once the earnout is settled must be recorded as compensation expense in our statement of earnings 

the increase in compensation expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 343 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 39 million and severance related costs 10 million 

these increases were partially offset by decreases in temporarystaffing expense 06 million and stock compensation expense 02 million the increase in employee headcount in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2010 and new production hires 

operating expense  the increase in operating expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to increases in office expense 118 million professional fees 101 million net rent and utilities 87 million travel and entertainment expense 67 million business insurance 42 million licenses and fees 42 million sales development expense 25 million and other expense 05 million also contributing to the increase in operating expenses in 2011 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a favorable foreign currency translation 09 million and decreases in litigation settlement expense 35 million bad debt expense 06 million and lease termination charges 05 million 

the increase in operating expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to increases in professional fees 28 million travel and entertainment expense 28 million licenses and fees 19 million unfavorable foreign currency translation 17 million litigation settlement expense 13 million net rent and utilities 12 million sales development expenses 03 million and office expense 02 million also contributing to the increase in operating expenses in 2010 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2010 these increases were partially offset by decreases in business insurance 34 million other expense 24 million and lease termination charges 08 million 

depreciation  the increases in depreciation expense in 2011 compared to 2010 and in 2010 compared to 2009 were due primarily to the purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2011 2010 and 2009 were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years 

amortization  the increases in amortization in 2011 compared to 2010 and in 2010 compared to 2009 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists noncompete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for noncompete agreements and ten years for trade names based on the results of impairment reviews in 2011 and 2010 we wroteoff 46 million and 23 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions no such indicators of impairment were noted in 2009 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the increase in income from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance during 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized 83 million 62 million and 41 million respectively of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2011 2010 and 2009 acquisitions during 2011 and 2010 we recognized 145 million and 88 million of income respectively related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 22 and 11 acquisitions respectively 

the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2011 2010 and 2009 acquisitions are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value we estimate the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth andor profitability we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income 

  

the income generated from the net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to our acquisition of the policy renewal rights from liberty mutual and the wausau signature agency which we refer to as liberty mutual in february 2009 as part of this transaction we acquired over 250 producers account managers and service staff from liberty mutual due to the underlying market conditions existing in early 2009 at the date of the transaction a deteriorating economy and uncertainty of when it would recover and the significant uncertainties related to this transaction that could affect the performance of the liberty mutual business we purchased the policy renewal rights related to liberty mutual’s middlemarket commercial pc business located in their midwest and southeast regions as opposed to buying a standalone brokerage agency a portion of the liberty business was cobrokered the extent of which was not known by liberty mutual at the time of the acquisition and the risks associated with moving captive agents to an open brokerage environment we structured this acquisition such that approximately 70 of the maximum purchase price was based on a three year earnout period we paid approximately 450 million as of the acquisition date with a potential maximum earnout payable of up to 1200 million to be paid in second quarter 2012 as of the acquisition date we initially estimated and recorded an earnout payable of approximately 640 million based on financial projections that incorporated assumptions to address the risks noted above we have been monitoring and updating the financial projections for this business using actual results during the earnout period and have made adjustments to the recorded earnout payable when applicable over the last few quarters we have seen some deterioration in client retention related to this business primarily due to cobrokered business and have been rationalizing staffing levels which has resulted in downward adjustments to our estimated financial projections and a decrease in the recorded earnout payable 

provision for income taxes  the brokerage segment’s effective tax rate in 2011 2010 and 2009 was 387 393 and 389 respectively we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 380 to 400 in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future 

  

risk management 

the risk management segment accounted for 26 of our revenue from continuing operations in 2011 the risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments in addition this segment generates revenues from integrated disability management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are substantially in the form of fees that are generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed 

the following two tables provide gaap reported and nongaap information see page 23 and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure that management believes is helpful when comparing risk management segment results for 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions except per share percentage and workforce data 

 

   

 

 effective october 1 2010 we acquired substantially all of the thirdparty administrator assets and managed care service operations of gab robins north america inc gab robins for cash of 160 million notes payable of 40 million and the assumption of certain claims handling runoff liabilities reported revenues related to gab robins were 459 million and 132 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

fees  the increase in fees for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to revenues associated with our acquisition of gab robins and new business and the impact of increased claim counts total of 684 million which were partially offset by lost business of 147 million in 2011 the increase in fees for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to revenues associated with the acquisition and new business of 390 million which were partially offset by lost business and the impact of decreased claim counts of 306 million in 2010 organic change in fee revenues was 9 in 2011 3 in 2010 and 1 in 2009

depreciation  depreciation expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 and reflects the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems depreciation expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 and reflects the impact of purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems 

amortization  amortization expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 and in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the gab robins acquisition which was effective on october 1 2010 historically the risk management segment has made few acquisitions we made no material acquisitions in this segment in 2011 and 2009 

provision for income taxes  the risk management segment’s effective tax rate in 2011 2010 and 2009 was 365  393 and 368 respectively we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 380 to 400 in our risk management segment for the foreseeable future

the corporate segment reports the financial information related to our clean energy and other investments our debt and certain corporate and acquisitionrelated activities see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our investments at december 31 2011 and 2010 and a detailed discussion of the nature of these investments see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our debt at december 31 2011 and 2010 

the following two tables provide gaap reported and nongaap information see page 23 and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure that management believes is helpful when comparing corporate segment results for 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions except per share and percentage data 

 

   

 

 revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

 in 2010 this represents revenues from the fourteen 2009 era plants which we initially consolidated due to our majority ownership interests and ability to control the operations of these plants as of march 1 2010 we sold portions of our investments in twelve of these plants which were no longer consolidated as of that date and such noncontrolling minority investments are now accounted for using equity method accounting we continue to consolidate the remaining two plants which did not run in 2011 or 2010 

  

  

  

 cost of revenues  cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2011 and 2010 includes the expenses incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above in 2011 the cost of revenues also included the expenses incurred 224 million to run the irc section 45 leased facility discussed above 

compensation expense  compensation expense for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively includes salary and benefit expenses of 62 million 56 million and 40 million and incentive compensation of 74 million 68 million and 37 million respectively the increased salary and benefit expenses for 2011 and 2010 were due to additional headcount salary and benefits expense increases the increases in incentive compensation for 2011 and 2010 were primarily related to the sales and operations of the facilities that qualify for tax credits under irc section 45

depreciation  the increases in depreciation expense in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to corporaterelated office build outs and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems 

benefit for income taxes  our consolidated effective tax rate was 306 195 and 369 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the rates for 2011 2010 and 2009 reflect the impact of the resolution andor the expiration of various statutes of limitations related to certain income tax matters in those years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions which resulted in a net decrease in our tax provision of 19 million 307 million and 36 million respectively in fourth quarter 2010 the irs completed its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years and we recognized 293 million of net earnings related to income tax positions taken in prior years 

  

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2011 operating results for the corporate segment with 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 interest and banking primarily includes expenses related to our debt clean energy investments include the operating results related to our investments in clean coal operations and chemmod acquisition costs include professional fees and other due diligence costs incurred related to our acquisitions corporate consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and in 2011 and 2010 costs related to a companywide award crossselling and motivational meeting for our production staff and field management legacy investments include the operating results related to the winddown of our legacy investment portfolio 

clean energy investments  in 2009 we built and placed in service fourteen commercial clean coal production plants 2009 era plants at december 31 2011 we held noncontrolling minority interests in five limited liability companies that own twelve 2009 era plants these plants are currently producing refined coal using chemmod llc’s technologies see below which reduce harmful emissions and that we believe qualify for irc section 45 tax credits collectively these twelve plants’ operations could generate for us approximately 43 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter through 2019 

at december 31 2011 we also held a controlling majority interest in a limited liability company that owns two 2009 era plants while these plants have produced refined coal using chemmod’s technologies in the past they are currently idle 

congress extended the deadline for clean coal production plants to be “placed in service” by two years from december 31 2009 to december 31 2011 tax credits on these plants can be earned for ten years from the placed in service date if the clean coal production plants are placed in service by december 31 2011 in conjunction with this extension and the marketing efforts of chemmod there is increased demand for irc section 45 projects and the chemmod technologies accordingly we have invested 334 million in fifteen commercial clean coal production plants that we placed in service producing refined coal using chemmod’s technologies prior to december 31 2011 2011 era plants 

at december 31 2011 we held controlling majority interests in seven limited liability companies that own the fifteen 2011 era plants as of january 1 2012 we sold majority portions of our investments in six limited liability companies that own five of the plants for 129 million these plants are currently producing refined coal under longterm purchase commitments with utilities collectively these five plants could generate for us approximately 80 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter through 2021 

we continue to seek and negotiate longterm purchase commitments for the remaining ten 2011 era plants which are currently idle our net carrying value of these investments at december 31 2011was 98 million we estimate that we will invest an additional net 20 million to house each of these plants prior to the resumption of production 

we have nonbinding agreements in principle with a utility and coinvestors for one of the 2011 era plants however these transactions and the related resumption of production is not expected until the second quarter of 2012 this plant could generate for us approximately 17 million of aftertax earnings per quarter through 2021 

it is too early at this time to predict when negotiations and transactions will be complete and what the ultimate earnings potential will be from the remaining nine 2011 era plants not currently under longterm purchase commitments 

ultimately we plan to sell majority ownership interests in all fifteen 2011 era plants and relinquish control of the plants under structures similar to the 2009 era plants thereby becoming a noncontrolling minority investor 

we also own a 42 controlling interest in chemmod llc which has been marketing its chemmod™ solution technologies principally to coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those utilities that are operating with the irc section 45 clean coal production plants in which we hold investments to date permits to utilize chemmod’s technologies have been permitted for coalfired utilities in twelve states several other states are in the process of granting similar approvals based on current production estimates provided by licensees chemmod could generate for us approximately 25 million of net aftertax earnings per quarter 

  

all estimates set forth above regarding the future quarterly earnings impact of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a “risk factors” see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these investments 

discontinued operations 

in 2008 we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business in 2009 we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations under the agreement we transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer also in 2009 we recorded 35 million in lease termination and other real estate costs while winding down the remaining leased facilities of the reinsurance brokerage operations in addition we wroteoff 45 million in receivables in 2009 related to the potential additional contingent proceeds from the initial sale transactions that were recognized in 2008 

in 2010 as part of integrating the operations of a londonbased insurance brokerage firm acquired by us on april 1 2010 and other real estate consolidation initiatives we restored into service certain leased real estate space that was abandoned in 2008 as part of the winddown of certain of our discontinued operations we recognized 32 million of pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily related to the reversal of a portion of the lease abandonment charges incurred in 2008 due to the irs completing its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years in fourth quarter 2010 we also recognized 85 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in our 2010 provision for income taxes related to discontinued operations 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet our cash requirements we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however to fund acquisitions made during 2011 and 2009 we relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings which were repaid before the end of fourth quarter under our credit agreements 

cash provided by operating activities was 2831 million 2318 million and 2115 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of fiduciary funds and in the payment of accrued liabilities and to an increased amount of noncash charges in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to timing differences between periods related to cash collections of premiums and fees receivable and cash disbursements of premiums payable and improved operating results in 2010 compared to 2009 our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses 

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on net earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that these items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective the focus should not be on premiums and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa currently imposes a minimum funding requirements for our plan the minimum funding requirement under the irc was 03 million in both 2011 and 2010 we were not required to make a minimum contribution in 2009 the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2011 2010 and 2009 we made discretionary contributions to the plan of 72 million 65 million and 40 million respectively we are considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2012 and may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the 

  

plan in future periods see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates in 2011 the funded status of the plans was significantly impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2011 the change in funded status of the plans resulted in an increase in noncurrent liabilities of 510 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 204 million and a reduction of our stockholders’ equity of 306 million in 2011 while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2011 2010 or 2009 changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 400 million 254 million and 235 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2012 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 550 million primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment the increase in net capital expenditures in 2011 from 2010 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2011 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 2643 million 789 million and 446 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions made in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009 was primarily due to the increase in the number of acquisitions made and the 1640 million of net cash paid for the heath lambert acquisition we completed 32 19 and 15 acquisitions in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively annualized revenues of entities acquired in 2011 2010 and 2009 totaled approximately 2770 million 1451 million and 985 million respectively 

during 2011 we issued 245000 shares of our common stock paid 82 million in cash and accrued 183 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 19 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 300 million during 2010 we issued 12 million shares of our common stock paid 59 million in cash and accrued 40 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 25 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 267 million during 2009 we issued 14 million shares of our common stock paid 60 million in cash and accrued 119 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 25 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 419 million during 2009 we also issued 11 million shares of our common stock related to an acquisition made in december 2008 and recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2008 

dispositions  during 2008 we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business under the agreements we received initial proceeds of 331 million and potential additional proceeds of up to 146 million in first quarter 2009 we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations under the agreement we transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 55 million 59 million and 116 million respectively we received cash proceeds of 140 million 32 million and 116 million related to these transactions 

clean energy investments  we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 we believe these investments will increase our cash flows and liquidity by generating tax credits that reduce our tax payments in future periods please see “clean energy investments” beginning on page 38 for a more detailed description of these investments including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties 

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs except for 2008 and 2005 our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted for noncash items ie ebitdac have increased year over year since 1991 in 2008 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations severance litigation impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation in 2005 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations we expect the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted for noncash items to continue in the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions additionally we anticipate a favorable impact on the amount we will pay the irs in 2012 and in future years based on anticipated tax credits from irc section 45 investments we also anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under the credit agreement described below under “cash flows from financing activities” and our common stock to fund acquisitions in addition we may from time to time consider other 

  

alternatives for longerterm funding sources such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings equity markets or restructuring our operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business 

cash flows from financing activities 

on july 15 2010 we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on july 14 2014 with a group of twelve financial institutions the credit agreement replaced a 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on october 4 2010 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement all indebtedness liabilities and obligations outstanding under the prior facility were fully paid and satisfied except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 

the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to 5000 million of which up to 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 500 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 6000 million 

in 2007 2009 and 2011 we entered into separate note purchase agreements with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors 4000 million 1500 million and 1250 million in aggregate debt respectively at december 31 2011 we had 6750 million of corporaterelated borrowings outstanding under the three note purchase agreements and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 2912 million we also use our credit agreement from time to time to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement there were 100 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2011 due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit 4741 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2011 

during 2011 we borrowed 1510 million and repaid 1410 million under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2011 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2010 we borrowed and repaid 480 million under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2010 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2009 we borrowed and repaid 1540 million and 2860 million respectively under a previous credit agreement principal uses of the 2009 borrowings under a previous credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in 2009 earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2009 and general corporate purposes 

the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2011 

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors declares dividends on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2011 we declared 1495 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 132 per common share on january 13 2012 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 33 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 31 2011 on january 26 2012 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2012 of 34 per common share a 3 increase over the prior quarter if the dividend is maintained at 34 per common share throughout 2012 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2012 of approximately 1560 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2011 or an increase in cash used of approximately 65 million we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors we did not repurchase any shares in 2011 2010 or 2009 we generally hold repurchased shares for reissuance in connection with our equity compensation and stock option plans under the provisions of the repurchase plan we were authorized to repurchase approximately 10000000 additional shares at december 31 2011 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources the common stock repurchases reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2011 2010 and 2009 include 41000 shares at a cost of 12 million 32000 shares at a cost of 08 million and 45000 shares at a cost of 10 million respectively that we repurchased from our employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years under these circumstances we withhold the proceeds from the repurchases and remit them to the taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 

  

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 739 million in 2011 367 million in 2010 and 83 million in 2009 prior to 2009 we issued stock options under four stock optionbased employee compensation plans the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of 10 per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant on may 10 2011 our stockholders approved the 2011 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip which replaced our previous stockholderapproved 2009 longterm incentive plan all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria stock options with respect to 61 million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip – 12 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose were available for grant under the ltip at december 31 2011 in addition we have an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in 2011 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 

shelf registration statement  on may 5 2010 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock as previously disclosed we have used this registration statement to register for resale shares of our common stock issued as acquisition consideration but we have not issued any shares under this registration statement the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we can make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any shares under this registration statement 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 6 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments excluding interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2011 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2011 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 58 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

note purchase agreements  on august 3 2007 we entered into a note purchase agreement as amended and restated on december 19 2007 with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 1000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 626 senior notes series a due august 3 2014 and 3000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 644 senior notes series b due august 3 2017 in a private placement 

on november 30 2009 we entered into another note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 1500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 585 senior notes series c due in three equal installments on each of november 30 2016 november 30 2018 and november 30 2019 in a private placement 

on february 10 2011 we entered into another note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 750 million in aggregate principal amount of our 518 senior notes series d due february 10 2021 and 500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 549 senior notes series e due february 10 2023 in a private placement 

  

see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements 

credit agreement  we have a 5000 million credit agreement which expires on july 14 2014 with a group of twelve financial institutions we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time at december 31 2011 159 million of letters of credit for which we have 81 million of liabilities recorded at december 31 2011 were outstanding under the credit agreement there were 100 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2011 accordingly at december 31 2011 4741 million remained available for potential borrowings of which 591 million may be in the form of additional letters of credit we are under no obligation to use the credit agreement in performing our normal business operations see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 

operating lease obligations  we generally operate in leased premises at our other locations certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 

we have leased certain office space to several nonaffiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements in the normal course of business we expect that the leases will not be renewed or replaced we adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 

outstanding purchase obligations  as a service company we typically do not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we have outstanding as of december 31 2011 these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and funding commitments as of december 31 2011 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 188 companies all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our 2011 2010 and 2009 acquisitions that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the aggregate amount of the maximum potential earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was 3012 million of which 1070 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2011 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date for acquisitions made prior to 2009 we did not include potential earnout obligations in the recorded purchase price for each applicable acquisition at its respective acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable we will generally record future payments made related to 2008 and prior acquisitions if any as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled the aggregate amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 related to earnout payables for acquisitions we made prior to january 1 2009 was 183 million there were no unrecorded earnout payables outstanding at december 31 2011 related to acquisitions we made prior to january 1 2009 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of control and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for using the equity method none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2011 and 2010 that was recourse to us 

  

at december 31 2011 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 102 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 81 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2011 we had posted 57 million of letters of credit to allow the rentacaptive facility to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december 31 2011 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and our cash equivalents investment portfolio as of december 31 2011 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2011 

we have other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions which can change rapidly in addition some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from us a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if we elect to withdraw financial or operational support 

as of december 31 2011 we had 6750 million of borrowings outstanding under our note purchase agreements the aggregate fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2011 was 7675 million due to the longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate an allin interest rate for discounting we obtained market quotes for notes with the same terms as ours which we have deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates we have not adjusted this rate for risk profile changes covenant issues or credit rating changes we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2011 and the resulting fair values would be 347 million higher than their carrying value or 7097 million 

as of december 31 2011 we had 100 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates market risk would be estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2011 and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying values 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from our uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incur expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of their revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian brazilian canadian indian and singaporean operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2011 a weakening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would decrease by approximately 61 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2011 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately 42 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars however it is management’s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to our consolidated operating results or financial position we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2011 2010 and 2009 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency disbursements through various future payment dates in addition during fourth quarter 2011 we had several monthly putcall 

  

options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates these hedging strategies are designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements but we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of our payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2011 2010 and 2009 see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in other comprehensive earnings in 2011 2010 and 2009

 see note 20 to our 2010 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information including earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets by operating segment for 2010 2009 and 2008 

  

our business particularly our brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations commission and fee revenues and the related brokerage and marketing expenses can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers on the other the hand salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year the timing of acquisitions and recognition of investment gains and losses also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results see note 19 to our 2010 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2010 and 2009 

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 72 of our revenue from continuing operations in 2010 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance carriers which are usually based upon both percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker by the insurer commission rates depend on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees paid to us by our clients depend on the extent and value of the services we provide in addition under certain circumstances we receive supplemental and contingent commissions for both retail and wholesale brokerage services a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid the insurance carrier determines the supplemental commission that is eligible to be paid annually based on historical performance criteria in advance of the contractual period a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 

we operate our brokerage operations through a network of more than 250 sales and service offices located throughout the united states and in 15 other countries most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel in addition we conduct business through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 110 countries around the world 

retail insurance brokerage operations 

our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 79 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2010 our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial propertycasualty and health and welfare insurance coverage significant lines of insurance coverage brokered are as follows 

 

 our retail brokerage operations are organized in 180 geographical profit centers located in the united states australia canada and uk and operate within certain key nichepractice groups which account for approximately 66 of our retail brokerage revenues these specialized teams target areas of business andor industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base significant nichepractice groups that we serve are as follows 

 

   

our specialized focus on these nichepractice groups allows for highlyfocused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of valueadded products and services specific to those industries or business segments we believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these nichepractice groups provide us with a competitive advantage 

we anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from 

 

  

  

  

 wholesale insurance brokerage operations 

our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 21 of our brokerage segment revenues in 2010 our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other nonaffiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hardtoplace insurance coverages through over 60 geographical profit centers located across the united states bermuda and through our approved lloyd’s of london brokerage operation in london in certain cases we act as a brokerage wholesaler and in other cases we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer’s business in a specific geographic territory activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing underwriting we do not assume risk the insurer does issuing policies collecting premiums appointing and supervising other agents paying claims and negotiating reinsurance 

over 75 of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers based on revenues our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as the largest domestic managing general agentunderwriting manager according to business insurance magazine’s october 11 2010 edition 

we anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of brokerclients developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs and through mergers and acquisitions 

risk management segment 

our risk management segment accounted for 25 of our revenues from continuing operations in 2010 our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to selfinsure some or all of their propertycasualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their propertycasualty claims departments approximately 69 of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers compensation related claims 27 are from general and commercial auto liability related claims and 4 are from property related claims in addition we generate revenues from integrated disability management employee absence management programs information services risk control consulting loss control services and appraisal services either individually or in combination with arising claims revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees that are generally negotiated in advance on a perclaim or perservice basis depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed 

risk management services are primarily marketed directly to fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies notforprofit organizations and public entities on an unbundled basis independent of our brokerage operations we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of approximately 110 offices located throughout the united states australia canada new zealand and the uk most of these offices are fully staffed with our claims adjusters and other service personnel our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients and customers 

while this segment complements our insurance brokerage offerings over 80 of our risk management segment’s revenues come from nonaffiliated brokerage customers such as insurance companies and clients of other insurance brokers based on revenues our risk management operation ranked as the world’s largest third party propertycasualty claims administrator according to business insurance magazine’s march 29 2010 edition 

we expect that the risk management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from fortune 1000 companies larger middlemarket companies captives program business and the outsourcing of insurance company claims departments in addition the risk management segment may grow in the future through mergers and acquisitions 

  

corporate segment 

the corporate segment includes the financial information related to our debt investments in cleanenergy ventures external acquisitionrelated costs and other corporate costs we have been winding down our legacy investments since 2003 at december 31 2010 significant investments managed by this segment include 

cleanenergy 

we have a 134 ownership interest in a wastetoenergy company enerdyne ltd llc which owns a biomass emissions pipeline that removes and sells gas emissions from landfills a 420 interest in a privatelyheld enterprise chemmod llc that has commercialized multipollutant reduction technologies that remove mercury sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions created by coalfired power plants and an 80 interest in a privatelyheld startup enterprise cquest technology llc which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels 

taxadvantaged investments 

prior to january 1 2008 we owned certain partnerships that were formed to develop energy that qualified for tax credits under the former irc section 29 these consisted of wastetoenergy partnerships and synthetic coal operations these investments helped to substantially reduce our effective income tax rate from 2002 through 2007 the law that permitted us to claim irc section 29 tax credits expired on december 31 2007 in 2009 we built eight commercial facilities to produce cleanburning coal using chemmod’s technologies we believe these operations will produce energy that will qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires on december 31 2019 for our related investments 

international operations 

our total revenues by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 were as follows in millions 

 

 see notes 7 18 and 20 to our 2010 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our foreign operations including goodwill allocation earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets by operating segment for 2010 2009 and 2008 

brokerage operations in australia bermuda canada and the uk 

the majority of our international brokerage operations are in australia bermuda canada and the uk 

we operate in australia and canada primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker in the uk we have a significant wholesale brokerage operation for us and international clients looking to access the lloyd’s of london and other international insurance markets a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to uk public entities and a retail commercial property casualty brokerage in bermuda we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies 

we also have ownership interests in two bermudabased insurance companies that operate segregated account “rentacaptive” facilities that enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership captive insurance companies are created for clients to insure their risks and capture underwriting profit and investment income which is then available for use by the insureds generally for reducing future costs of their insurance programs 

we also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 110 countries we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area 

risk management operations in australia canada new zealand and the uk 

our international risk management operations are principally in australia canada new zealand and the uk services are similar to those provided in the united states and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients 

markets and marketing 

we operate our brokerage operations through a network of more than 250 sales and service offices located throughout the united states and in 15 other countries we manage our thirdparty claims adjusting operations through a network of 110 offices located throughout the united states australia canada new zealand and the uk our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities no material part of our business depends upon a single 

  

customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations in 2010 our largest single customer accounted for approximately 1 of total revenues and our ten largest customers represented 6 of total revenues in the aggregate our revenues are geographically diversified with both domestic and international operations 

each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small marketshare position and as a result we believe has substantial organic growth potential in addition each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations have the ability to grow through the acquisition of small to mediumsized independent brokerages see “business combinations” below 

while historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically and we expect to continue to do so from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment 

we require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities including all of our executive officers to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control as defined in the agreements 

competition 

brokerage segment 

according to business insurance magazine’s july 19 2010 edition we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business 

our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with aon corporation marsh  mclennan companies inc and willis group holdings ltd each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us in addition various other competing firms such as wells fargo insurance services inc brown  brown inc hub international ltd lockton companies inc and usi holdings corporation operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients in addition for healthwelfare products and benefit consultant services we compete with larger firms such as aon hewitt mercer a subsidiary of marsh  mclennan companies inc towers watson  co and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms and we also compete with a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies 

our wholesale brokerage operations compete with large wholesalers such as crump group inc crc insurance services inc rt specialty amwins group inc swett  crawford group inc as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers 

we also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us 

risk management segment 

our risk management operation currently ranks as the world’s largest propertycasualty third party administrator based on revenues according to business insurance magazine’s march 29 2010 edition while many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space we compete directly with sedgwick claims management services inc broadspire services inc a subsidiary of crawford  company xchanging and esis a subsidiary of ace limited several large insurance companies such as aig insurance and zurich insurance also maintain their own claims administration units which can be strong competitors particularly during the softening insurance cycle in addition we compete with various smaller third party administrators on a regional level we believe that our competitive position is due to our strong reputation for outstanding service quality and ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most costefficient manner possible 

regulation 

we are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business in addition most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities be personally licensed these licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in most jurisdictions licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities 

business combinations 

we have completed and integrated 254 acquisitions from january 1 1985 through december 31 2010 almost exclusively within our brokerage segment the majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local propertycasualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas over the last decade we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas acquisition prices typically fall within the 1 million to 50 million purchase price range 

  

through acquisitions we seek to expand our talent pool enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities andor broaden and further diversify our business mix we also focus on identifying 

 

  

  

 see note 4 to our 2010 consolidated financial statements for a summary of our 2010 acquisitions the amount and nature of the consideration paid and the dates of acquisition 

effective on january 1 2011 we acquired substantially all of the net assets of the gleason agency inc and gleason financial ltd operations engaged in the retail insurance brokerage business in exchange for approximately 43 million in cash 342000 shares of our common stock and a contingent earnout obligation of 60 million of which any portion that is earned will be paid with cash or shares of our common stock at our option

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example for several years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market which in turn put downward pressure on our commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas beginning in late 2000 the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing because of the events of september 11 th  many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased in some cases dramatically beginning in late 2003 the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas while the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rateprice sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines the higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007 because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing which we cannot predict or control our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities 

  

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours in addition various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality may have in that region or locality an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office we believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business 

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

a continuation or worsening of the recent economic recession may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the general deterioration in the economy which began in fourth quarter 2008 could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact our 2011 commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our client overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and as a result reduce our revenues and profitability the failure of an insurer with whom we places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by our clients which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies we may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations 

in the past several years we have completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in us achieving slower growth moreover even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets we may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows us to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions our acquisitions pose the risk of postacquisition deterioration which could result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges additionally we may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with our acquisitions including for example liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act which we refer to as fcpa violations when we acquire businesses with international operations if any of these developments occur our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the united states including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk 

we conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the united states as a result we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries operating in these countries may present risks that are different from or greater than the risks we face doing comparable business in the united states these include among others risk relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

we also operate in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the united states and more stable countries adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries for example we use thirdparty service providers located in india for certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india however such factors could potentially affect our operations or ability to use thirdparty providers in the future should our access to these services be disrupted our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations 

our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

if any of these developments occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we are subject to regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable 

many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision including insurance industry regulation federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate including the financial services authority which we refer to as the fsa in the uk failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to litigation andor disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business for example although our inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois ended on october 1 2009 compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public state attorneys general and state insurance departments which could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice if this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

during march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act together the 2010 health care reform legislation were signed into law the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in our employee benefits consulting business will be negatively impacted in addition if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters which we believe to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 17 to our 2010 consolidated financial statements we are subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could expose us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources which could adversely affect our financial results 

contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations 

a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume andor growth thresholds andor insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control actual contingent commissions andor supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including our senior management brokers and other key personnel in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers brokers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability 

the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans substantially affects our profitability in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

we have developed production operations with the ability to produce refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 however there are significant uncertainties surrounding our investment in these operations and if we are not successful in claiming irc section 45 tax credits we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations 

irc section 45 provides a tax credit for the production and sale of refined coal from production operations that are placed into service on or before december 31 2011 we own 42 of chemmod llc which has developed technologies referred to as the chemmod™ solution that reduce harmful emissions from coalfired power plants we intend to use the chemmod™ solution to produce refined coal at eight production operations placed into service prior to december 31 2009 we believe that the production and sale of this refined coal qualifies for irc section 45 tax credits we incurred 314 million of capital expenditures in 2009 to complete the construction of these operations we sold portions of our ownership stake in six of these operations which reduced our net investment in the operations to 223 million 

there are significant uncertainties related to our irc section 45 investments that must be favorably resolved in order for us to recoup our investment and generate additional earnings from these operations these include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 our irc section 45 operations and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the operations andor the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals such laws and regulations also impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise involved in the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using the chemmod™ solution in a number of ways including air emissions waste water and byproducts such as fly ash one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chem mod™ solution at locations owned and operated by others we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod™ solution for example we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage it is also not uncommon for private claims by 

  

third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage diminution of property or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically benefited from section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29related partnerships in which we had an interest we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them however while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage our reputation 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change our business or make investments 

the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility including our ability to pay dividends we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all 

economic financial and industry conditions beyond our control may affect our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our debt the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under such agreements to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

  

if we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools our client relationships growth strategy and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships growth strategy and operating results 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment 

our corporate segment holds a variety of investments these investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation tax audits and disputes failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability 

in the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities should we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in our company 

volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders 

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report 

we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the united states and abroad we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients our brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks we are headquartered in itasca illinois have operations in 16 countries and do business in more than 110 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants we generate approximately 87 of our revenues domestically with the remaining 13 derived in australia bermuda canada new zealand and the uk we have three reportable operating segments brokerage risk management and corporate which contributed approximately 72 25 and 3 respectively to 2010 revenues our major sources of operating revenues are commissions fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income is generated from our investment portfolio which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds as well as cleanenergy investments and venture capital funds 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

2010 financial highlights 

the economic downturn continued to provide significant headwinds for our business in 2010 as a result organic revenue declined in both our brokerage and risk management segments for our brokerage segment organic commissions fees and supplemental commissions defined below declined 17 and for our risk management segment organic fees declined 27 despite the difficult operating environment we grew brokerage segment revenues by 50 and risk management segment revenues by 20 earnings from continuing operations were up 95 for our brokerage segment and 20 for our risk management segment while adjusted ebitdac margin defined below held steady at 219 for our brokerage segment and 156 for our risk management segment 

we achieved these results by demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control while continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy during 2010 we closed 18 acquisitions in our brokerage segment representing 951 million in annualized acquired revenues we also completed a meaningful acquisition in our risk management segment representing 500 million in annualized acquired revenues in 2010 we continued to grow our international operations through acquisitions by the end of 2010 13 of our revenues were generated internationally compared with 11 in 2009 we expect this trend to continue in 2011 

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by propertycasualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced propertycasualty premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing propertycasualty premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 

as markets harden certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms now account for 50 of the total us commercial propertycasualty market our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

  

inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations historically has had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on our revenues than inflationary pressures 

beginning in 2004 and continuing throughout 2010 the propertycasualty insurance market has been operating in a relatively soft market in most lines and in most geographic areas for example surveys by the council of insurance agents  brokers which we refer to as the ciab indicated that commercial propertycasualty rates fell during first second and third quarters of 2010 the average premium decline for all commercial accounts regardless of size was 53 for first quarter 64 for second quarter and 52 for third quarter a similar survey by the ciab indicated that commercial propertycasualty rates fell again during fourth quarter 2010 by an average of 54 for all commercial accounts regardless of size strong competition for new business among propertycasualty insurance carriers attempting to increase market share in a weak economy continued the downward pressure on rates in addition insureds also added to the downward pressure on rates in the quarter as they negotiated to get the best terms and rates from the propertycasualty insurance carriers the ciab does not expect to see pricing turn upward until demand picks up and capacity in the market place diminishes the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 80 of the commercial propertycasualty premiums in the united states 

recent events 

the deterioration in the economy that began in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted us in 2010 and could continue to do so in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in among other things their headcount payroll properties and the market value of their assets such reductions could also adversely impact our commission revenues in future years when the propertycasualty insurance carriers perform exposure audits and if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy 

during march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to together as the 2010 health care reform legislation were signed into law the 2010 health care reform legislation among other things increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and therefore are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation as a result the potential exists for our employee benefits consultants to win new clients and generate additional revenue from existing clients by assisting them in navigating the increasingly complex regulations surrounding their benefits plans in 2010 our employee benefits consulting operation generated approximately one quarter of the brokerage segment’s revenues although we believe that the 2010 health care reform legislation could be beneficial to our brokerage segment’s fee revenues given the legislation’s broad scope and the uncertainties that exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of many of the legislation’s complex provisions at this time the potential impact of the legislation on us beneficial or otherwise is uncertain 

we own positions in eight commercial cleancoal operations we own approximately 25 of six of these operations during most of the first nine months of 2010 these six operations produced refined coal under temporary regulatory operating permits as planned these operations curtailed most production in fourth quarter 2010 to perform testing routines in connection with applying for permanent regulatory operating permits in january 2011 one of the six operations received its permanent regulatory operating permit we cannot predict when the permanent operating permits will be issued for the remaining five operations if these six operations receive permanent permits and operate at historical levels they could generate up to 40 to 60 million of quarterly net earnings through 2019 

in addition we own 90 of the other two operations which as planned did not produce refined coal in fourth quarter while we were seeking operating sites and potential coinvestors for these operations we are currently in negotiations for these two operations although we expect to have them in production by third or fourth quarter of 2011 we cannot predict with certainty when the negotiations will be complete when sites will be secured or when permanent operating permits will be issued if these two operations are running at planned levels they could generate up to 30 to 50 million of quarterly net earnings through 2019 

however our ability to recoup these cleancoal investments and generate net earnings on them is subject to significant risks and uncertainties relating to among other things our utility partners’ ability to obtain permanent permits the facilities’ compliance with irc section 45 possible future changes in regulations utilities’ use of coal to produce electricity the operations of the facilities our coinvestors and operational partners and the defense of their intellectual property please see the risk factor regarding our irc section 45 facilities under item 1a “risk factors” for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition  we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts typically we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of propertycasualty transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit operations under these direct bill arrangements the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services which we provide over a period of time typically one year we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 

income taxes  our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we evaluate our tax positions using a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position if a tax position does not meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may decrease within the next twelve months 

tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

  

we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assetsearnout obligations  intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses we classify our intangible assets as either goodwill expiration lists or noncompete agreements expiration lists and noncompete agreements are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for noncompete agreements while goodwill is not subject to amortization allocation of intangible assets between goodwill expiration lists and noncompete agreements and the determination of estimated useful lives are based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods different estimates or assumptions could produce different results we carry intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 

we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2010 and 2008 we wrote off 23 million and 27 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets related to brokerage segment acquisitions no such indicators were noted in 2009 the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted on a prospective basis revised guidance to account for our acquisitions which includes the estimation and recognition of the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions from 2009 and into the future whose purchase agreements contain such provisions subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred potential earnout obligations are typically based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired businesses for acquisitions made prior to january 1 2009 we did not include such obligations in the purchase price recorded for each applicable acquisition at the acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable we generally record future payments made under these 2008 and prior arrangements if any as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled which will have no impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated statement of earnings see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2010 business combinations 

historically we have not incurred a material amount of external transaction costs related to our acquisitions however when we have incurred such costs we have capitalized these costs as part of our purchase accounting effective january 1 2009 we expense all external transaction costs related to our acquisitions as incurred 

business combinations and dispositions 

see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2010 business combinations we did not have any material dispositions in 2010 or 2009 

historically we have used acquisitions to grow our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries we expect that our brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions we intend to continue to consider from time to time additional acquisitions for our brokerage and risk management segments on terms that we deem advantageous at any particular time we generally will be engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates however we can make no assurances that any additional acquisitions will be consummated or if consummated that they will be advantageous to us 

  

results of operations 

information regarding nongaap measures 

in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations we provide information regarding ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and organic change in commission fee and supplemental commission revenues these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition our industry peers provide similar supplemental nongaap information although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments the nongaap information we provide should be used in addition to but not as a substitute for the gaap information provided certain reclassifications have been made to the prioryear amounts reported in the annual report in order to conform them to the currentyear presentation 

earnings measures   we believe that the presentation of ebitdac ebitdac margin adjusted ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac margin provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis adjusted ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac margin are meant to reflect the true operating performance of our business consequently they exclude items that could be considered “nonoperating” or “noncore” in nature 

 

  

  

  

 organic revenues   organic change in commission fee and supplemental commission revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission fee and supplemental commission revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the revenue growth that is associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year in addition organic growth excludes the impact of contingent commission revenues and the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency translation the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying 2010 foreign exchange rates to the same periods in 2009 

these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that will be continuing in 2010 and beyond management has historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments management also believes that using this measure allows financial statement users to measure analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 

reconciliation of nongaap information presented to gaap measure  this annual report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for each of ebitdac adjusted ebitdac adjusted ebitdac margin and organic change in commission fee and supplemental commission revenues 

other information 

allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue headcount and other information we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were computing income tax provisions on a separate company basis as a result the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated in 2010 because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provides for irc section 45 credits expires on december 31 2019 for our related investments we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 390 to 410 in both our brokerage segment and our risk management segment for the foreseeable future reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results pretax profit margin compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings from continuing operations divided by total revenues the compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues the operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues 

  

brokerage segment 

the brokerage segment accounted for 72 of our revenue from continuing operations in 2010 our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place propertycasualty employerprovided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions principally for middlemarket commercial industrial public entity religious and notforprofit entities many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as selfinsurance pools risk retention groups or captive insurance companies our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized unique and hardtoplace insurance programs 

our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based on a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients for wholesale brokerage services we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer commission rates depend on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees depend on the extent and value of the services we provide in addition under certain circumstances both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period

the following provides nongaap information that management believes is helpful when comparing certain components of 2010 organic revenues with 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 commissions and fees  the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2010 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2010 579 million commissions and fees in 2010 included new business production of 1413 million which was offset by renewal decreases and lost business of 1620 million the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2009 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2009 1428 million commissions and fees in 2009 included new business production of 1394 million which was offset by renewal decreases and lost business of 1780 million the organic decline in commission fee and supplemental commission revenues was 2 in 2010 and 2009 and 0 in 2008 commission revenues increased 5 and fee revenues decreased 3 in 2010 compared to 2009 commission revenues increased 7 and fee revenues increased 13 in 2009 compared to 2008 

  

supplemental and contingent commissions  reported supplemental and contingent commission revenues recognized in 2010 2009 and 2008 by quarter are shown in the table below as we have previously disclosed many insurance carriers now provide sufficient information for us to recognize supplemental commission revenues on a quarterly basis for a majority of our 2010 supplemental commission arrangements however in 2009 and prior years most carriers only provided this information on an annual basis after the end of the contract period accordingly the 2010 amounts reported in the table below include both a full year of 2009 supplemental commission revenues and 2010 supplemental commission revenues that were recognized by us on a quarterly basis this situation is not expected to occur again in 2011 and later years as we anticipate that most of the carriers will continue to provide information on a quarterly basis sufficient to allow us to recognize revenues in a similar manner in future quarters we expect to recognize a total of approximately 90 million to 110 million of supplemental commission revenues in each quarter of 2011 assuming that the current market conditions continue in those future quarters 

to assist in comparing 2010 to 2009 the supplemental commission timing line in the organic revenue tables above adjusts the 2009 revenue as if we had been receiving the information from the carriers and recognizing the quarterly supplemental commissions in 2009 on the same basis as in 2010 in order to estimate the quarterly information for 2009 and 2008 as if it would have been reported by the carriers we allocated the annual amounts received from the carriers after the contract period to each quarter in the annual period on a straightline pro rata basis the adjusted supplemental commission amounts for 2009 and 2008 would change if different allocation methods were used 

an analysis of supplemental and contingent commission revenues recognized in 2010 2009 and 2008 by quarter is as follows in millions 

 

 investment income  investment income primarily represents interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and restricted funds the decreases in investment income in 2010 and 2009 compared to 2008 were due to lower market yield and a shift to safer investment vehicles 

  

gains on books of business and other  we recognized a 27 million gain related to our acquisition of the remaining 60 equity interest in specialised broking associates pty ltd which we refer to as sba in july 2010 we previously had a 40 equity interest in sba with the option to increase our ownership to 100 the gain represents the increase in fair value of our original 40 equity interest in sba based on the purchase price paid for the remaining 60 equity interest the decrease in onetime gains related to sales of books of business and other in 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 was due to the unusually high level of disposition activity that occurred in 2009 and 2008 onetime gains related to sales of books of business in 2010 2009 and 2008 were 59 million 116 million and 238 million respectively 

compensation expense  the increase in compensation expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 343 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 39 million and severance related costs 10 million 

these increases were partially offset by decreases in temporarystaffing expense 06 million and stock compensation expense 02 million the increase in employee headcount in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2010 and new production hires 

the increase in compensation expense in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees salary increases onetime compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results 552 million in the aggregate increases in employee benefits expense 189 million and severance related costs 12 million 

these increases were partially offset by decreases in temporarystaffing expense 25 million and stock compensation expense 15 million the increase in employee headcount in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2009 

operating expense  the increase in operating expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to increases in professional fees 28 million travel and entertainment expense 28 million licenses and fees 19 million unfavorable foreign currency translation 17 million litigation settlement expense 13 million net rent and utilities 12 million sales development expenses 03 million and office expense 02 million 

these increases were partially offset by decreases in business insurance 34 million other expense 24 million and lease termination charges 08 million also contributing to the increase in operating expenses in 2010 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2010 

the decrease in operating expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to decreases in professional fees 110 million sales development expenses 59 million travel and entertainment expense 57 million favorable foreign currency translation 26 million licenses and fees 20 million and bad debt expense 19 million 

these decreases were partially offset by an increase in office expense 06 million also partially offsetting the decreases in operating expenses in 2009 were expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2009 

depreciation  the increases in depreciation expense in 2010 compared to 2009 and in 2009 compared to 2008 were due primarily to the purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2010 2009 and 2008 were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years 

amortization  the increases in amortization in 2010 compared to 2009 and in 2009 compared to 2008 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years expiration lists and noncompete agreements are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for noncompete agreements based on the results of impairment reviews in 2010 and 2008 we wrote off 23 million and 27 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions no such indicators were noted in 2009 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  the change in estimated acquisition earnout payable expense as reported in 2010 compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the adoption of revised accounting guidance for business combinations which was effective january 1 2009 for acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2010 during 2010 and 2009 we recognized 62 million and 41 million respectively of expense in our consolidated statement of earnings related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations related to our 2009 and 2010 acquisitions in addition during 2010 we recognized 88 million of income related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance for 11 acquisitions 

provision for income taxes  the brokerage segment’s effective tax rate in 2010 2009 and 2008 was 393 389 and 390 respectively we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 390 to 410 in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future

 effective october 1 2010 we acquired substantially all of the thirdparty administrator assets and managed care service operations of gab robins north america inc for cash of 160 million notes payable of 40 million and the assumption of certain claims handling runoff liabilities we expect this transaction to generate approximately 500 million in revenues annually 

fees  the increase in fees for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to revenues associated with the acquisition and new business of 390 million which were partially offset lost business and the impact of decreased claim counts of 306 million in 2010 organic fee revenues for 2010 declined 3 compared to 2009 the decrease in fees for 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to lost business and the impact of decreased claim counts of 422 million in 2009 which were partially offset by new business of 328 million organic fee revenues for 2009 declined 1 compared to 2008

revenues  revenues in the corporate segment consist of the following 

 

  

  

  

 cost of revenues  cost of revenues from consolidated cleancoal production facilities includes the costs incurred by the eight cleancoal production operations to generate the revenues discussed above these operations were insignificant in 2009 and did not run in 2008 

compensation expense  compensation expense for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively includes salary and benefit expenses of 56 million 40 million and 60 million and incentive compensation of 68 million 37 million and 27 million respectively the increase in salary and benefit expenses for 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to additional headcount and increases in employee benefits expense the decrease in salary and benefit expenses for 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to reduced headcount and compensation the increases in incentive compensation for 2010 and 2009 are primarily related to the sales and operations of the facilities that qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 

operating expense  operating expense for 2010 includes professional fees of 12 million primarily related to cleancoal activities expense and minority interest totaling 19 million related to royalty income other corporate operating expenses of 49 million and external professional fees and other external due diligence costs of 29 million related to 2010 acquisitions an 81 million donation to the arthur j gallagher charitable foundation and 27 million of costs incurred for a companywide award and sales meeting in fourth quarter 2010 we donated all of our holdings in a privateequity fund valued at 56 million on the donation date plus 25 million in cash to the foundation in fourth quarter 2010 we incurred 27 million of costs related to a companywide award and sales meeting for its production staff and field management which we view as a onetime event operating expense for 2009 includes professional fees of 17 million primarily related to cleancoal activities expense of 19 million related to royalty income and other corporate operating expenses of 34 million operating expense for 2008 includes professional fees of 14 million primarily related to cleancoal activities a 75 million provision related to a state sales tax matter a 15 million decrease for the irc section 29related estimated expenses and other corporate operating expenses of 13 million the increase in operating expense for 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to increased corporate costs 15 million professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2010 acquisitions 29 million the 81 million donation and 27 million for the companywide award and sales meeting the increase in operating expense for 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to 19 million of costs related to cleancoal activities 21 million of increased corporate costs and the 15 million irc section 29related expense adjustment from 2008 that did not recur in 2009 

the 36 million credit in 2009 related to the prioryear state tax matters is a reversal of the remaining provision after the final resolution of these matters the 75 million provision in 2008 was the estimated cost to resolve these prioryear state tax matters 

  

interest expense  the increase in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to interest on the 1500 million note purchase agreement entered into on november 30 2009 80 million partially offset by a substantial reduction in the amount of borrowing under the prior credit agreement plus a reduction in the interest rate of those borrowings 20 million the interest expense was relatively unchanged in 2009 compared to 2008 because the higher level of borrowings on our line of credit in 2009 was offset by substantially reduced interest borrowing rates in 2009 compared to 2008 

depreciation  the increase in depreciation expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to corporaterelated office buildouts and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems depreciation expense was relatively unchanged in 2009 compared to 2008 

benefit for income taxes  our consolidated effective tax rate was 195 369 and 319 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the rates for 2010 2009 and 2008 reflect the impact of the resolution andor the expiration of various statutes of limitations related to certain income tax matters in those years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions which resulted in a net decrease in our tax provision of 307 million 36 million and 149 million respectively in fourth quarter 2010 the irs completed its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years and we recognized 293 million of net earnings related to income tax positions taken in prior years 

the following provides nongaap information that we believe is helpful when comparing 2010 operating results for the corporate segment with 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 interest and banking primarily includes the interest costs related to our debt cleanenergy ventures include the operating results related to our ownership interests in the eight commercial cleancoal operations and chemmod acquisition costs include professional fees and other due diligence costs incurred related to our acquisitions corporate consists of banking and debt fees overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and in 2010 costs related to a companywide award crossselling and motivational meeting for its production staff and field management legacy investments include the operating results related to the winddown of our legacy investment portfolio 

reconciliation of ebitdac  the following provides a reconciliation of ebitdac to the most directly comparable gaap measure for 2010 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 cleanenergy operations  we own positions in eight commercial cleancoal operations we own approximately 25 of six of these operations during most of the first nine months of 2010 these six operations produced refined coal under temporary regulatory operating permits as planned these operations curtailed most production in fourth quarter 2010 to perform testing routines in connection with applying for permanent regulatory operating permits in january 2011 one of the six operations received its permanent regulatory operating permit we cannot predict when the permanent operating permits will be issued for the remaining five operations if these six operations receive permanent permits and operate at historical levels they could generate up to 40 to 60 million of quarterly net earnings through 2019 

  

in addition we own 90 of the other two operations which as planned did not produce refined coal in fourth quarter while we were seeking operating sites and potential coinvestors for these operations we are currently in negotiations for these two operations although we expect to have them in production by third or fourth quarter of 2011 we cannot predict with certainty when the negotiations will be complete when sites will be secured or when permanent operating permits will be issued if these two operations are running at planned levels they could generate up to 30 to 50 million of quarterly net earnings through 2019 

chemmod is in the early stages of commercializing and marketing its chemmod™ solution technologies to their principal customers coalfired power plants owned by utility companies including those utilities that are operating with the cleancoal production facilities that we built 

our ability to recoup cleancoal related investments and generate earnings is subject to significant risk and uncertainties relating to among other things our utility partners’ ability to obtain longterm permits the facilities’ compliance with irc section 45 possible future changes in regulations the utilities’ use of coal to produce electricity the operations of the facilities our coinvestors and operation partners and the defense of their intellectual property also while we believe that refined coal production at the cleancoal production operations using the chemmod™solution will qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 we can make no assurances that the production will continue to meet the requirements of irc section 45 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

discontinued operations 

in fourth quarter 2007 we made a determination to exit our global reinsurance operations and our irish wholesale brokerage operations in first quarter 2008 we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business under the agreements we received proceeds of 331 million and potential additional proceeds of up to 146 million 

in first quarter 2009 we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations under the agreement we transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer 

we recorded 35 million in lease termination and other real estate costs in 2009 while winding down the remaining leased facilities of the reinsurance brokerage operations in addition we wrote off 45 million in receivables in 2009 related to the potential additional contingent proceeds from the initial sale transactions that were recognized in 2008 

as part of integrating the operations of a londonbased insurance brokerage firm acquired by us on april 1 2010 and other real estate consolidation initiatives we restored into service certain leased real estate space that was abandoned in 2008 as part of the winddown of certain of our discontinued operations we recognized 32 million of pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily related to the reversal of a portion of the lease abandonment charges incurred in 2008 due to the irs completing its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years in fourth quarter 2010 we also recognized 85 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in our 2010 provision for income taxes related to discontinued operations 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock repurchases of our common stock funding of our investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet our cash requirements we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future however to fund acquisitions made during 2009 we relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings which were repaid before the end of fourth quarter under a previous credit agreement 

cash provided by operating activities was 2318 million 2115 million and 1606 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to timing differences between periods related to cash collections of premiums and fees receivable and cash disbursements of premiums payable and improved operating results in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation payments and income tax payments our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and our noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization changes in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses 

  

when assessing our overall liquidity we believe that the focus should be on earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items in our consolidated statement of earnings and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that these items are indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective the focus should not be on premiums and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from us in addition funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held as fiduciary funds are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 

our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc the employee retirement security act of 1974 as amended which we refer to as erisa currently imposes a minimum funding requirement for our plan which is 03 million for 2011 the minimum funding requirement under the irc was 03 million for 2010 the plan’s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2010 we made discretionary contributions of 65 million to the plan we are considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2011 and may be required to make minimum contributions to the plan in future periods 

we recognize in our consolidated balance sheet an asset for our defined benefit postretirement plans’ overfunded status or a liability for our plans’ underfunded status we recognize changes in the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans in comprehensive earnings in the year in which the changes occur see notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss” net of tax in our consolidated balance sheet we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings as appropriate in the year in which they occur numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates in 2008 the funded status of the plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2008 reflecting an increase in credit costs on high quality corporate debt obligations and negative investment returns the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a reduction in noncurrent assets of 148 million and an increase in noncurrent liabilities of 561 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 287 million and a reduction of our stockholders’ equity of 422 million in 2008 in 2009 the funded status of the plans significantly improved primarily due to favorable investment returns the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities of 305 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 124 million and an increase of our stockholders’ equity of 181 million in 2009 in 2010 the funded status of the plans improved primarily due to favorable investment returns partially offset by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2010 the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities of 100 million while the change in funded status of the plans had no impact on our cash flows from operations in 2010 2009 or 2008 changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 254 million 235 million and 320 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in 2011 we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 300 million primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment the increase in net capital expenditures in 2010 from 2009 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2010 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 789 million 446 million and 2742 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decreased use of cash for acquisitions made in 2010 and 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to the decrease in the number of acquisitions made and the increased use of our common stock to complete acquisitions we completed 19 15 and 37 acquisitions in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively annualized revenues of entities acquired in 2010 2009 and 2008 totaled approximately 1451 million 985 million and 1656 million respectively 

  

during 2010 we issued 12 million shares of our common stock paid 59 million in cash and accrued 40 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 25 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 267 million during 2009 we issued 14 million shares of our common stock paid 60 million in cash and accrued 119 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 25 acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 419 million during 2009 we also issued 11 million shares of our common stock related to an acquisition made in december 2008 and recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2008 during 2008 we issued 18000 shares of our common stock paid 201 million in cash and accrued 52 million in liabilities related to earnout obligations of 13 acquisitions made prior to 2008 and recorded additional goodwill of 235 million 

dispositions  during 2008 we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business under the agreements we received initial proceeds of 331 million and potential additional proceeds of up to 146 million in first quarter 2009 we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations under the agreement we transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 we sold several books of business and recognized onetime gains of 59 million 116 million and 238 million respectively which approximated the cash proceeds we received related to these transactions 

outlook  we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and longterm cash flow needs except for 2008 and 2005 our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have increased year over year since 1991 in 2008 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations severance litigation impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation in 2005 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations we expect the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to continue in the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions additionally we anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under the credit agreement and our common stock to fund acquisitions in addition we may from time to time consider other alternatives for longerterm funding sources such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings equity markets or restructuring our operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business 

cash flows from financing activities 

on july 15 2010 we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement which expires on july 14 2014 with a group of twelve financial institutions the credit agreement replaced a 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on october 4 2010 which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement all indebtedness liabilities and obligations outstanding under the prior facility were fully paid and satisfied except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 

the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to 5000 million of which up to 750 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to 500 million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement we may from time to time request subject to certain conditions an increase in the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of 6000 million 

in third quarter 2007 and fourth quarter 2009 we entered into separate note purchase agreements with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors 4000 million and 1500 million in aggregate debt respectively we are currently in the process of securing another 1250 million of longterm debt to fund acquisitions which we expect to close and fund in midfebruary 2011 at december 31 2010 we had 5500 million of corporaterelated borrowings outstanding under the two note purchase agreements and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 2498 million we also use our credit agreement from time to time to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2010 due to outstanding letters of credit 4839 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2010 

during 2010 we borrowed and repaid 480 million under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2010 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes during 2009 we borrowed and repaid 1540 million and 2860 million respectively under a previous credit agreement principal uses of the 2009 borrowings under a previous credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in 2009 earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2009 and general corporate purposes during 2008 we borrowed and repaid 2320 million and 1000 million respectively under a previous credit agreement principal uses of the 2008 borrowings under a previous credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in 2008 and earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2008 

the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2010 

  

dividends  our board of directors determines our dividend policy our board of directors declares dividends on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2010 we declared 1361 million in cash dividends on our common stock or 128 per common share on january 14 2011 we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 32 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 31 2010 on january 27 2011 we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2011 of 33 per common share a 3 increase over the prior quarter if the dividend is maintained at 33 per common share throughout 2011 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2011 of approximately 1430 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2010 or an increase in cash used of approximately 119 million we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 

common stock repurchases  we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors we did not repurchase any shares in 2010 2009 or 2008 we generally hold repurchased shares for reissuance in connection with our equity compensation and stock option plans under the provisions of the repurchase plan we were authorized to repurchase approximately 10000000 additional shares at december 31 2010 the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at our discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources the common stock repurchases reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2010 2009 and 2008 include 32000 shares at a cost of 08 million 45000 shares at a cost of 10 million and 55000 shares at a cost of 13 million respectively that we repurchased from our employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years under these circumstances we withhold the proceeds from the repurchases and remit them to the taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 

common stock issuances  another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were 367 million in 2010 83 million in 2009 and 226 million in 2008 prior to 2009 we issued stock options under four stock optionbased employee compensation plans in may 2008 all of these plans expired the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of 10 per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant on may 12 2009 our stockholders approved the 2009 longterm incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip all of our officers employees and nonemployee directors and persons expected to become officers employees or nonemployee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria as of december 31 2010 365000 shares of our common stock were available for awards granted under the ltip in addition we have an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95 of its fair market value prior to january 1 2009 eligible employees were allowed to purchase our common stock at 85 of its market value for all periods prior to january 1 2009 we recognized compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan effective january 1 2009 we no longer recognize any compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 

shelf registration statement  on may 5 2010 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock as previously disclosed we have used this registration statement to register for resale shares of our common stock issued as acquisition consideration but we have not issued any shares under this registration statement the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand market conditions and other factors we can make no assurances regarding when or if we will issue any shares under this registration statement 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with our investing and operating activities we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 3 8 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments our future minimum cash payments excluding interest associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31 2010 are as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2010 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 79 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

note purchase agreements  on august 3 2007 we entered into a note purchase agreement as amended and restated on december 19 2007 with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 1000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 626 senior notes series a due august 3 2014 and 3000 million in aggregate principal amount of our 644 senior notes series b due august 3 2017 in a private placement 

on november 30 2009 we entered into another note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold 1500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 585 senior notes series c due in three equal installments on each of november 30 2016 november 30 2018 and november 30 2019 in a private placement 

see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements 

credit agreement  we have a 5000 million credit agreement which expires on july 14 2014 with a group of twelve financial institutions we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time at december 31 2010 161 million of letters of credit for which we have 82 million of liabilities recorded at december 31 2010 were outstanding under the credit agreement no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2010 accordingly at december 31 2010 4839 million remained available for potential borrowings of which 589 million may be in the form of additional letters of credit we are under no obligation to use the credit agreement in performing our normal business operations see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 

operating lease obligations  we generally operate in leased premises certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 

we have leased certain office space to several nonaffiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements in the normal course of business we expect that the leases will not be renewed or replaced we adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 

outstanding purchase obligations  we typically do not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we have outstanding as of december 31 2010 these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and funding commitments as of december 31 2010 are as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit all of our letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 we have acquired 156 companies all of which were accounted for using the purchase accounting method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of our acquisitions from 2009 and into the future that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the maximum earnout obligations related to the 2010 acquisitions are disclosed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements which represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the purchase agreements related to the applicable acquisitions the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired businesses over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date for acquisitions made prior to 2009 we did not include potential earnout obligations in the recorded purchase price for each applicable acquisition at its respective acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable we will generally record future payments made related to 2008 and prior acquisitions if any as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled the aggregate amount of maximum unrecorded earnout payables outstanding at december 31 2010 was 1694 million and related to acquisitions we made from 2006 to 2008 

offbalance sheet debt  our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation these investments are accounted for using the equity method based on the legal form of our ownership interest and the applicable percentage of the entity owned none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2010 and 2009 that was recourse to us 

at december 31 2010 we had posted two letters of credit totaling 104 million in the aggregate related to our selfinsurance deductibles for which we have recorded a liability of 82 million we have an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2010 we had posted 57 million of letters of credit to allow the rentacaptive facility to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks in our daytoday operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments we held as of december 31 2010 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates in the ordinary course of business we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

  

our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and our cash equivalents investment portfolio as of december 31 2010 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december 31 2010 

we have other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions which can change rapidly in addition some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from us a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if we elect to withdraw financial or operational support 

as of december 31 2010 we had 5500 million of borrowings outstanding under our note purchase agreements the aggregate fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2010 was 6106 million due to their longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations no active or observable market exists for our private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate an allin interest rate for discounting we obtained market quotes for notes with the same terms as ours which we have deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates we have not adjusted this rate for risk profile changes covenant issues or credit rating changes we estimated market risk as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december 31 2010 and the resulting fair values would be 288 million higher than their carrying value 

as of december 31 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement however in the event that we do have borrowings outstanding the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates market risk would be estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in our weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2010 and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying values 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from our uk based subsidiaries that incur expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of their revenues in us dollars in addition we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian and canadian operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as transactions occur assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2010 a weakening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would decrease by approximately 23 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2010 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately 25 million we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars however it is management’s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to our consolidated operating results or financial position we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations historically we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk during 2010 and 2009 we had several monthly putcall options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency disbursements through various future payment dates this hedging strategy is designed to protect us against significant uk currency exchange rate movements but we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of our payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged the impact of this hedging strategy was not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2010 2009 and 2008

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine gallagher’s profitability 

gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for its brokerage services gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example for several years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market which in turn put downward pressure on gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas beginning in late 2000 the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing because of the events of september 11 th  many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased in some cases dramatically beginning in late 2003 the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas while the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rateprice sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines the higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007 because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing which gallagher cannot predict or control its brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as gallagher those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect gallagher’s profitability because gallagher does not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes gallagher cannot accurately forecast its commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result gallagher’s budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of its operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from its traditional brokerage activities 

gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in one or more areas of its business gallagher competes with four firms that are as large as or significantly larger than gallagher in terms of revenues in the global risk management and brokerage markets in addition there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office that is as large as or larger than in terms of revenues the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect gallagher’s business 

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect gallagher these developments include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for gallagher’s products and services to change which could in turn adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

the current disruption in the global credit markets and instability of financial systems and a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession may adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

the current disruption in the global credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets these conditions have resulted in the failure of a number of financial institutions and unprecedented action by governmental authorities and central banks around the world including investing in or lending money to financial institutions and insurance companies that are perceived to need additional capital it is difficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which gallagher’s markets products and business will be adversely affected 

these unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets and the resulting impact on a number of financial institutions have limited access to capital and credit for many companies although gallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility which expires in october 2010 and is not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of its lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend gallagher credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect its ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact gallagher’s ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings renewals or refinancings 

the disruptions in the credit and financial markets also led to a general deterioration in the economy in fourth quarter 2008 and throughout 2009 which could adversely impact gallagher in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that its clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties and the market values of assets among other factors such reductions could also adversely impact gallagher’s 2010 and 2011 commission revenues when exposure audits by the carriers are performed and if subsequent downward premium adjustments are determined the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of gallagher’s clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy which would have an adverse effect on gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition gallagher also has a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties gallagher could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to gallagher which could have a significant adverse impact on gallagher’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that gallagher offers its clients overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected which could reduce gallagher’s placement of certain lines and types of insurance and as a result reduce its revenues and profitability the failure of an insurer with whom gallagher places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by gallagher’s clients which could adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

gallagher has historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions 

in the past several years gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in gallagher achieving slower growth moreover even if gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions additionally gallagher may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with its acquisitions if any of these developments occur gallagher’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

the agreements and instruments governing gallagher’s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact gallagher’s ability to operate its business 

the agreements governing gallagher’s debt contain covenants that among other things restrict gallagher’s ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change gallagher’s business or make investments 

the restrictions in the agreements governing gallagher’s debt may prevent it from taking actions that it believes would be in the best interest of gallagher’s business and its stockholders and may make it difficult for gallagher to execute its business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted gallagher may also incur future debt obligations that might subject it to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect gallagher’s financial and operational flexibility gallagher cannot make any assurances that it will be able to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to gallagher or at all 

gallagher’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing gallagher’s debt may be affected by economic financial and industry conditions beyond gallagher’s control the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest which could have a material adverse effect on gallagher’s financial condition and results of operations 

gallagher could incur substantial losses if one of the commercial banks and financial institutions gallagher uses in its operations should happen to fail 

gallagher maintains cash balances including restricted cash held in premium trust and claim accounts at various depository institutions although gallagher has moved a substantial portion of its us funds into accounts or funds insured or guaranteed by the us government there are client claim funds which gallagher administers that are in individual accounts with balances well in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits gallagher also maintains cash balances in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs if one or more of the depository institutions in which gallagher maintains significant cash balances were to fail gallagher’s ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and gallagher could face a significant liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses 

gallagher has nonus operations which expose it to certain additional risks including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk 

gallagher has operations that conduct business outside the us accordingly gallagher is subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries operating in these countries may present risks that are different from or greater than the risks to gallagher of doing comparable business in the us these include among others risk relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

some of gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although gallagher has used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations 

gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations for example gallagher uses thirdparty service providers located in india for certain backoffice services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected gallagher’s operations in india however such factors could potentially affect gallagher’s operations or ability to utilize thirdparty providers in the future should gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

gallagher faces a variety of risks in its risk management operations that are distinct from those it faces in its brokerage operations 

gallagher’s risk management business faces a variety of risks distinct from those faced by its brokerage business including 

 

  

  

  

  

 if any of these developments occur gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide if gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects gallagher’s operations gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable 

many of gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary actions that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of gallagher’s authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from timetotime require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder gallagher’s ability to operate its business for example although gallagher’s inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois ended on october 1 2009 compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public state attorneys general and state insurance departments which could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice if this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

changes in gallagher’s accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect its financial position and operating results 

gallagher prepares its financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these accounting principles require gallagher to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its consolidated financial statements gallagher is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period gallagher periodically evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of intangible assets 

  

investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies gallagher bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that gallagher believes to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on gallagher’s future financial position results of operations and cash flows 

gallagher is subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to gallagher would adversely affect its financial results 

gallagher is subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that its employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that gallagher holds for its clients on a fiduciary basis gallagher has established provisions against these potential matters which it believes to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice and gallagher adjusts such provisions from timetotime based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to gallagher it could materially adversely affect its future financial results in addition gallagher’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future gallagher’s insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which it selfinsures gallagher has purchased errors and omissions eo insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from timetotime as current developments warrant 

as more fully described in note 17 to gallagher’s 2009 consolidated financial statements gallagher is subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on gallagher’s business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on gallagher by exposing it to negative publicity reputational damage harm to gallagher’s client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources 

contingent commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions and any decrease in the amount of contingent commissions received by gallagher could adversely affect its results of operations 

gallagher derives a portion of its revenues from contingent commissions paid by insurance companies contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year if due to the current economic environment or for any other reason gallagher is unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability volume andor growth thresholds andor insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves over which gallagher has no control actual contingent commissions received by gallagher could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations additionally because of these uncertainties it is difficult for gallagher to make profitsharing calculations and accurately estimate the amount of contingent commissions it will receive during a given year 

gallagher’s future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

gallagher believes that its future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including its senior management brokers and other key personnel the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of any of its senior managers brokers or other key personnel or its inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition 

sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce gallagher’s profitability 

gallagher’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under its legacy defined benefit plans in recent years gallagher has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond gallagher’s control including increases in health care costs declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate 

  

pension and related liabilities a significant decrease in the value of gallagher’s defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years although gallagher has actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance gallagher will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce gallagher’s profitability 

gallagher has historically benefited from section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting gallagher to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to gallagher’s synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 in 2009 2008 and 2007 gallagher’s annual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was 369 319 and 227 respectively gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate for 2007 reflects the tax credits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operated alternative energy projects under irc section 29 the rates for 2009 2008 and 2007 reflect the impact of the resolution of a number of income tax matters related to prior years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions which resulted in a net decrease in gallagher’s tax provision of 36 million 149 million and 59 million respectively 

gallagher believes its claim for irc section 29related related tax credits is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings plrs previously obtained by irc section 29related partnerships in which it had an interest gallagher understands these plrs are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and has received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them 

while gallagher’s synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause gallagher to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29related tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

gallagher has developed production facilities with the ability to produce refined coal that it believes qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45 however there are significant uncertainties surrounding gallagher’s investment in these facilities and if gallagher is not successful in claiming irc section 45 tax credits gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities 

irc section 45 provides a tax credit for the production and sale of refined coal from production facilities that were placed into service on or before december 31 2009 gallagher owns 42 of chemmod llc which has developed technologies the chemmod ™ solution that reduce harmful emissions from coalfired power plants gallagher intends to use the chemmod ™ solution to produce refined coal at eight production facilities placed into service prior to december 31 2009 gallagher believes that the production and sale of this refined coal qualifies for irc section 45 tax credits gallagher has funded 297 million of capital expenditures to date and has committed to make additional capital expenditures of 17 million in 2010 to complete the construction contract obligations of these facilities once gallagher has finalized arrangements with various partners expected to purchase equity stakes in one or more of the facilities gallagher’s net investment in the facilities is expected to be approximately 160 million 

there are significant uncertainties related to gallagher’s irc section 45 investments that must be favorably resolved in order for gallagher to recoup its investment and generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities these include but are not limited to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 operations at the irc section 45 production facilities and the byproducts from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs 

the construction and operation of the irc section 45 production facilities are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations generally require the facilities andor the utilities at which the facilities are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals such laws and 

  

regulations also impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to or are otherwise involved in the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using the chemmod ™ solution in a number of ways including air emissions waste water and byproducts such as fly ash one party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties by using the chem mod ™ solution at facilities owned and operated by others gallagher and its partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage they may have had little if any involvement in creating such risk remains even after operations cease at a facility to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chemmod ™ solution for example gallagher and its partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chemmod ™ solution no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury property damage diminution of property or similar claims furthermore many environmental health and safety laws authorize citizen suits permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance gallagher’s insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm gallagher’s reputation 

one of gallagher’s significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of its clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants gallagher maintains policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless gallagher cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm gallagher’s reputation and subject it to liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which gallagher provides services gallagher’s failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to gallagher’s reputation in the marketplace 

gallagher is exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by its financial services business 

gallagher’s financial services business holds a variety of investments these investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation tax audits and disputes failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of gallagher’s invested assets and adversely affect its net worth and profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with gallagher’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that are included elsewhere herein 

gallagher is engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty pc claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad gallagher believes that one of its major strengths is its ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to its clients gallagher’s brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and gallagher does not assume underwriting risks gallagher is headquartered in itasca illinois has operations in fifteen countries and does business in more than 100 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants gallagher generates approximately 89 of its revenues domestically with the remaining 11 derived in australia bermuda canada new zealand and the uk gallagher operates three business segments brokerage risk management and financial services and corporate which contributed approximately 74 26 and less than 1 respectively to 2009 revenues the two major sources of operating revenues for gallagher are commissions and fees from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income and other revenue is generated from gallagher’s investment portfolio which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds as well as alternative energy cleanenergytaxadvantaged investments and venture capital funds 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 please see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i of this annual report for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by pc insurance carriers carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced pc premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as heavier than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing pc premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 

as markets harden there historically has been resistance among certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance gallagher’s brokerage clients to pay increased premiums and the higher commissions generated by these premiums such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate gallagher for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms account for almost 50 of the total us commercial pc market gallagher’s brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to gallagher such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

  

inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures thereby resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations historically has had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on gallagher’s revenues than inflationary pressures 

beginning in 2004 and continuing throughout 2009 the pc insurance market has been operating in a relatively soft market in most lines and in most geographic areas for example surveys by the council of insurance agents  brokers ciab indicated that commercial pc rates fell during first second and third quarters of 2009 the average premium decline for all commercial accounts regardless of size was 51 for first quarter 49 for second quarter and 58 for third quarter a similar survey by the ciab indicated that commercial pc rates fell again during fourth quarter 2009 by an average of 56 for all commercial accounts regardless of size according to the most recent survey the rates for small medium and large business accounts declined slightly less than rates in the third quarter strong competition for new business by carriers looking to increase market share in a still weak economy continued the downward pressure on rates in addition insureds also added to the downward pressure on rates in the quarter as they negotiated to get the best terms and rates from the carriers the ciab does not expect to see pricing turn upward until demand picks up and capacity in the market place diminishes the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 80 of the commercial pc premiums in the us 

historically gallagher has utilized acquisitions to grow its brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues acquisitions allow gallagher to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend its presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries gallagher expects that its brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions gallagher is considering and intends to continue to consider from timetotime additional acquisitions on terms that it deems advantageous at any particular time gallagher generally will be engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates however no assurances can be given that any additional acquisitions will be consummated or if consummated that they will be advantageous to gallagher 

the disruption in the global credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets in 2008 and 2009 particularly in the us and europe have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions including participants in the insurance industry continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets and a recessionary environment may reduce gallagher’s customers’ demand for its brokerage and risk management services and could negatively affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition additionally the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance coverages that gallagher offers to its brokerage customers could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which in turn could have the effect of reduced placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduced revenues and profitability for gallagher in addition the deterioration in the economy that occurred in fourth quarter 2008 and throughout 2009 could adversely impact gallagher in 2010 and future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that its clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties market values of assets etc such reductions could also adversely impact gallagher’s 2010 and future years’ commission revenues when exposure audits by the carriers are performed and if subsequent downward premium adjustments are determined the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known and as a result any improvement in gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy in addition some of gallagher’s clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that gallagher offers its clients overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected which could reduce gallagher’s placement of certain lines and types of insurance and as a result reduce its revenues and profitability the failure of an insurer with whom gallagher places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by gallagher’s clients which could adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

as discussed in more detail in the financial services and corporate section gallagher has made capital expenditures and commitments totaling 314 million as of december 31 2009 to build eight commercial cleanenergy facilities in january 2010 gallagher has sold a portion of three of the facilities recouping 95 million of its 314 million capital investment and is in the process of finding partners for the remaining five facilities throughout 2010 gallagher and its current and future partners will seek to optimize the operations of the facilities and finalize necessary regulatory operating requirements once fully operational gallagher could generate up to 40 million of aggregate annual aftertax income through a combination of pretax income and tax credits under irc section 45 through 2019 however gallagher’s ability to recoup these investments and generate earnings on them is subject to significant risk and uncertainties relating to among other things its utility partners’ ability to obtain longterm permits the facilities’ compliance with irc section 45 possible future changes in regulations utilities’ use of coal to produce electricity the operations of the facilities gallagher’s coinvestors and operational partners and intellectual property please see the risk factor regarding gallagher’s irc section 45 facilities under item 1a “risk factors” for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties 

during fourth quarter 2009 gallagher recorded pretax charges totaling approximately 118 million as a result of the completion of a previously announced plan to reduce and the reorganization of its middle and back office workforce by approximately 400 positions and from the termination of certain office leases gallagher currently estimates the future annual pretax cost savings associated with these actions to be approximately 340 million anticipated to partially offset these future savings will be increased employee medical costs salary increases and increased incentive compensation costs totaling 120 million to 140 million related to the remaining workforce 

  

contingent commission matters 

the insurance industry has in recent years been subject to scrutiny by various regulatory bodies with respect to contingent compensation arrangements during the period from january 2006 through september 2009 gallagher’s retail brokerage operations were prohibited from accepting retail contingent commissions under the terms of a settlement agreement with the illinois attorney general and illinois department of insurance this agreement was amended in july 2009 and pursuant to the amendment as of october 1 2009 gallagher is no longer prohibited from accepting retail contingent commissions as a result of this amendment gallagher anticipates that it could generate additional retail contingent commission revenues of up to 100 million on an annualized basis by 2011 

critical accounting policies 

gallagher’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes gallagher believes the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations commission revenues related to installment premiums are recognized as the installments are billed contingent commissions supplemental commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers are recognized as revenue when the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts have been obtained by gallagher typically these types of commission revenues cannot be reasonably determined until the cash or the related policy detail is received by gallagher from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commissions paid is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of pc transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by gallagher’s employee benefit operations under these direct bill arrangements the billing and policy issuance process is controlled entirely by the insurance carrier the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known 

fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services which are provided over a period of time typically one year these fee revenues are recognized ratably as the services are rendered the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in the consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts the allowance for estimated policy cancellations is established through a charge to revenues while the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience gallagher periodically reviews the adequacy of these allowances and makes adjustments as necessary the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

income taxes 

gallagher’s tax rate reflects its earnings statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions gallagher reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as required by gaap gallagher evaluates its tax positions using a twostep process the first step involves recognition gallagher determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue gallagher recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

  

tax law requires items be included in gallagher’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 

valuation allowances are established or adjusted for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets gallagher considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly gallagher evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of its analysis negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidences includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions gallagher uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account gallagher’s recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 

intangible assets 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses gallagher classifies its intangible assets as either goodwill expiration lists or noncompete agreements expiration lists and noncompete agreements are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for noncompete agreements while goodwill is not subject to amortization allocation of intangible assets between goodwill expiration lists and noncompete agreements and the determination of estimated useful lives are based on valuations gallagher receives from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization in the consolidated balance sheet 

gallagher reviews all of its intangible assets for impairment periodically at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such impairment reviews are performed at the division level ie reporting unit with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2008 and 2007 gallagher wroteoff 27 million and 88 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions the 2007 intangible asset writeoff was reported in discontinued operations in the 2007 consolidated statement of earnings no such indicators were noted in 2009 the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised accounting guidance for business combinations the primary requirements of the revised guidance are as follows 

 

  

  

 effective january 1 2009 gallagher adopted the revised guidance on a prospective basis to account for its acquisitions which includes the estimation and recognition of the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of its 2009 acquisitions whose purchase agreements contain such provisions subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations will be recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings when incurred potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired entities for acquisitions made prior to january 1 2009 such obligations were not included in the purchase price recorded for each applicable acquisition at its acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable future payments made under these 2008 and prior arrangements if any will be generally recorded as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled and will have no impact on the amounts reported in gallagher’s consolidated statement of earnings see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the 2009 business combinations 

  

historically gallagher has not incurred a material amount of external transaction costs related to its acquisitions however when it has incurred such costs gallagher has capitalized these costs as part of its purchase accounting effective january 1 2009 gallagher expenses all external transaction costs related to its acquisitions as incurred

for investments that do not have quoted market prices gallagher utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value and proactively looks for indicators of impairment factors that may indicate that an impairment could exist include among others defaults on interest andor principal payments reductions or changes to dividend payments sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance recent refinancings or recapitalizations unfavorable press reports untimely filing of financial information significant customer or revenue loss litigation tax audits losses by other companies in a similar industry overall economic conditions management and expert advisor changes and significant changes in strategy in addition in cases where the ultimate value of an investment is directly dependent on gallagher for future financial support gallagher assesses its willingness and intent to provide future funding 

if an indicator of impairment exists gallagher compares the investment’s carrying value to an estimate of its fair value to estimate the fair value of its equity investments gallagher compares values established in recent recapitalizations or appraisals conducted by third parties in some cases no such recapitalizations or appraisals exist and gallagher must perform its own valuations this also requires gallagher to exercise significant judgment even if impairment indicators exist no writedown may be required if the estimated fair value is not less than the current carrying value or the decline in value is determined to be temporary and gallagher has no intent to sell the investment and it is more likely than not that gallagher will not be required to sell the investment prior to a recovery in value when gallagher determines the decline in fair value is otherthantemporary and therefore that a writedown is required it is recorded as a realized loss against current period earnings 

both the process to review for indicators of impairment and if such indicators exist the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporate quantitative data and qualitative criteria including the receipt of new information that can significantly change the decision about the valuation of an investment in a short period of time the determination of whether a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment the timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings could vary if management’s conclusions were different 

due to the inherent risk of investments gallagher cannot give assurance that there will not be impairments in the future should economic and other conditions change

results of operations 

in the discussion that follows regarding gallagher’s results of operations gallagher provides organic growth percentages with respect to its commission and fee revenues this information may be considered a “nongaap financial measure” because it is derived from gallagher’s consolidated financial information but is not required to be presented in financial statements that are prepared in conformity with gaap rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec require supplemental explanations and reconciliations of all “nongaap financial measures” when gallagher refers to organic growth percentages with respect to its commission and fee revenues in its discussion of results of operations gallagher excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from the acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the revenue growth that is associated with the operations that were part of gallagher in both the current and prior year in addition organic growth excludes contingent commission revenues and foreign currency translation these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that will be continuing in 2009 and beyond management has historically utilized organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of its brokerage and risk management segments management also believes that the use of this measure allows financial statement users to measure analyze and compare the growth from its brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner a reconciliation of organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the brokerage and risk management segments is presented in the paragraphs immediately following each table in which such percentages are presented 

allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue headcount and other information gallagher allocates the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were preparing income tax provisions on a separate company basis as a result the provision for income taxes for the financial services and corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to gallagher of the irc section 29related credits in 2007 because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provided for irc section 29related credits expired on december 31 2007 gallagher anticipates reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 390 to 410 in both its brokerage segment and its risk management segment for the foreseeable future reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

  

in the discussion that follows regarding gallagher’s results of operations gallagher also provides the following ratios with respect to its operating results pretax profit margin compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings from continuing operations divided by total revenues the compensation expense ratio is derived by dividing compensation expense by total revenues the operating expense ratio is derived by dividing operating expense by total revenues

gallagher is an investor in three cleanenergy ventures 

chemmod a multipollutant reduction venture possesses rights information and technologies for the reduction of unwanted emissions created during the combustion of coal chemmod has developed and is the exclusive licensee of proprietary emissions technologies it refers to as the chemmod ™ solution which uses a dual injection sorbent system to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions at coalfired power plants although chemmod is in the early stages of commercializing the technologies the principal potential market for the chemmod ™ solution is coalfired power plants owned by utility companies effective august 18 2008 gallagher has a 42 direct and indirect ownership interest in chemmod and is required to consolidate its operations into gallagher’s consolidated financial statements prior to august 18 2008 these ownership interests in chemmod were accounted for using equity method accounting in addition gallagher through a whollyowned subsidiary owns a 20 direct equity interest in chemmod international llc the exclusive licensee of the chemmod ™ solution on a global basis excluding the us and canada chemmod continues to market its technologies in an effort to secure more commercial licenses while gallagher currently believes that its chemmod interests may prove to have substantial value there can be no assurance given as to timing or amount if any with respect to any realization on this investment 

gallagher believes that the application of the chemmod ™ solution will qualify for refined coal tax credits under irc section 45 gallagher has made and committed to capital expenditures of 314 million as of december 31 2009 to build eight refined coal facilities that will be used in the operations of utilities two utilities have signed definitive agreements to operate six of the eight facilities in january 2010 gallagher sold portions of three facilities to a major institutional partner recouping 95 million as a down payment thereby reducing gallagher’s net investment to 219 million gallagher is currently seeking 

  

other utilities for the operation of the two remaining facilities and additional partners to invest in the facilities these facilities were placed in service by december 31 2009 and must meet certain other requirements in order to qualify for tax credits under irc section 45 the irs issued guidance in december 2009 which further clarified the requirements of irc section 45 gallagher believes the guidance was favorable to the facilities being able to comply with the operating and testing requirements thereby further validating gallagher’s belief that these operations will generate anticipated irc section 45 tax credits while gallagher believes that the refined coal production at these facilities will qualify for tax credits there can be no assurance that gallagher will be able to meet the requirements of irc section 45 or that gallagher’s investments will produce value 

cquest possesses rights information and technology for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels gallagher through a whollyowned subsidiary currently owns a 5 direct equity interest in cquest and has an option to acquire an additional 22 direct interest in cquest in addition gallagher through a whollyowned subsidiary currently owns a 5 direct equity interest in cquest international and has an option to acquire an additional 22 direct interest in cquest international which possesses rights to use information and technology of cquest on a global basis excluding the us and canada gallagher’s options to acquire the additional 22 direct interest in cquest and cquest international are exercisable at any time on or prior to april 18 2010 at an exercise price of 55 million for each option 110 million total while gallagher currently believes that its cquest interests may prove to have substantial value there can be no assurance given as to timing or amount if any with respect to any realization on this investment 

gallagher owns 134 of a biomass company and related partnerships which own the rights to biogas from landfills and the wells infrastructure and a pipeline to capture distribute and sell biogas 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically gallagher’s capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on its common stock repurchases of its common stock funding of its investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically gallagher has depended on its ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet its cash requirements however to fund acquisitions made during 2008 gallagher relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings under its credit agreement management believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit agreement will provide gallagher with adequate resources to meet its liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities was 2115 million 1606 million and 2523 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation payments and income tax payments the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to interest paid on the 4000 million of notes issued under the note purchase agreement an increase in incentive compensation payments an increase in errors and omissions claim payments and a decrease in operating earnings generated from the brokerage and risk management operations gallagher’s cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from its earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and its noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased and other noncash compensation expenses 

when assessing the overall liquidity of gallagher the focus should be on earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items in the consolidated statement of earnings and cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable net cash flows provided by operations may vary substantially from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear related to these items in order to consider these items in assessing trends in liquidity for gallagher they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from gallagher in addition funds legally restricted as to gallagher’s use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held as fiduciary funds are presented in gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining gallagher’s overall liquidity 

gallagher’s policy for funding its defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the plan in 2009 or 2010 contribution rates are determined by the plan’s actuaries based on funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of gallagher’s cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases during 2009 gallagher made discretionary contributions of 40 million to the plan gallagher is considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2010 and may be required to make contributions to the plan in future periods 

  

gallagher recognizes in its consolidated balance sheet an asset for its defined benefit postretirement plans’ overfunded status or a liability for its plans’ underfunded status gallagher recognizes changes in the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in comprehensive earnings in the year in which the changes occur see notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed related to its defined benefit postretirement plans gaap requires that gallagher recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for its underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans the plans the offsetting adjustment to the amount of liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” net of tax in gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate the change in funded status of the plans is impacted by numerous items including actual results compared with prior estimates and assumptions and changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates in 2008 the funded status of gallagher’s plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2008 reflecting an increase in credit costs on high quality corporate debt obligations and negative asset returns the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a reduction in noncurrent assets of 148 million and an increase in noncurrent liabilities of 561 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 287 million and a reduction of gallagher’s stockholders’ equity of 422 million in 2008 in 2009 the funded status of gallagher’s plans significantly improved primarily due to favorable asset returns the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities of 305 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 124 million and an increase of gallagher’s stockholders’ equity of 181 million in 2009 while the change in funded status of the plans had no impact on gallagher’s cash flows from operations in 2009 or 2008 changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in its pension plan have an effect on gallagher’s capital position and could require gallagher to make significant contributions to its defined benefit pension plan and increase its pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from financing activities 

at december 31 2009 gallagher had 5500 million of corporate related borrowings outstanding under two note purchase agreements entered into in 2009 and 2007 and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 2059 million gallagher also has a 4500 million credit agreement it uses from timetotime to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2009 due to outstanding letters of credit 4360 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2009 

in third quarter 2007 and fourth quarter 2009 gallagher entered into separate note purchase agreements with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which gallagher issued and sold to the investors 4000 million and 1500 million in aggregate debt respectively see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements during 2009 gallagher borrowed and repaid 1540 million and 2860 million respectively under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2009 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in 2009 earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2009 and general corporate purposes during 2008 gallagher borrowed and repaid 2320 million and 1000 million respectively under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2008 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in 2008 and earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2008 during 2007 gallagher borrowed and repaid 2839 million under the credit agreement principal uses of the borrowings under the credit agreement in 2007 were to fund acquisitions and earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2007 and to fund stock repurchases borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement in 2007 were fully repaid in third quarter 2007 using proceeds from the note purchase agreement the remaining net proceeds from the note purchase agreement were principally used for acquisitions and stock repurchases the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various covenants that require gallagher to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios gallagher was in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2009 

unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets particularly in the us and europe have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies these disruptions could make it more difficult for gallagher to obtain financing for its operations or investments or increase its cost of obtaining financing 

although gallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility and is not aware of any issues currently impacting the ability or willingness of the lenders under its revolving credit facility to honor their commitment to extend credit the us and global credit crisis could adversely affect its ability to borrow on its revolving credit facility in the future the credit agreement expires on october 4 2010 gallagher believes that it will not encounter any significant issues with the ability or willingness of the lenders to renew the credit facility 

gallagher also has a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties gallagher could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to gallagher which could have a significant adverse impact on gallagher’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

for a further discussion of risks associated with gallagher’s financing activity see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

dividends  gallagher’s dividend policy is determined by the board of directors dividends are declared on a quarterly basis by the board of directors after consideration of gallagher’s available cash from earnings its anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2009 gallagher declared 1304 million in cash dividends on its common stock or 128 per common share on january 15 2010 gallagher paid a fourth quarter dividend of 32 per common share to shareholders of record at december 31 2009 on january 28 2010 gallagher announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter of 2010 of 32 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 32 per common share throughout 2010 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2010 of approximately 1312 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2009 or an increase in cash used of approximately 10 million 

common stock repurchases  gallagher has a common stock repurchase plan that has been approved by the board of directors gallagher did not repurchase any shares in 2009 or 2008 and repurchased 92 million shares at a cost of 2608 million 2007 repurchased shares are generally held for reissuance in connection with gallagher’s equity compensation and stock option plans under the provisions of the repurchase plan at december 31 2009 gallagher was authorized to repurchase approximately 100 million additional shares the plan authorizes the repurchase of gallagher’s common stock at such times and prices as gallagher may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions gallagher is under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at gallagher’s discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under gallagher’s credit agreement or other sources the common stock repurchases reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2009 2008 and 2007 include 45000 shares at a cost of 10 million 55000 shares at a cost of 13 million and 37000 shares at a cost of 10 million respectively that were repurchased by gallagher from its employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years under these circumstances gallagher withholds the proceeds from the repurchases and remits them to the taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 

another source of liquidity to gallagher is the issuance of its common stock pursuant to its stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from issuance of common stock under these plans were 83 million in 2009 226 million in 2008 and 222 million in 2007 prior to 2009 gallagher issued stock options under four stock optionbased employee compensation plans in may 2008 all of these plans expired the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of 10 per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant on may 12 2009 the stockholders of gallagher approved the 2009 longterm incentive plan ltip all officers employees and nonemployee directors of gallagher and persons expected to become officers employees or nonemployee directors of gallagher are eligible to receive awards under the ltip awards which may be granted under the ltip include nonqualified and incentive stock options stocksettled stock appreciation rights restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria as of december 31 2009 580000 shares of gallagher’s common stock were available for awards granted under the ltip in addition gallagher has an employee stock purchase plan espp which allows gallagher’s employees to purchase its common stock at 95 of its fair market value prior to january 1 2009 eligible employees were allowed to purchase its common stock at 85 of its market value for all periods prior to january 1 2009 gallagher recognized compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the espp effective january 1 2009 gallagher no longer recognize any compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the espp proceeds from the issuance of its common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities and gallagher believes this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future but at reduced levels from what occurred historically 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 235 million 320 million and 407 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2010 gallagher expects total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 300 million primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment the decrease in net capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2008 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 446 million 2742 million and 2150 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 was due to the increase in the number of acquisitions made in each respective year gallagher completed fifteen thirtyseven and twentyone acquisitions in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

during 2009 gallagher issued 14 million shares of its common stock paid 60 million in cash and accrued 119 million in current liabilities related to earnout obligations of twentyfive acquisitions made prior to 2009 and recorded additional goodwill of 419 million during 2009 gallagher also issued 11 million shares of its common stock related to an acquisition made in december 2008 and recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2008 during 2008 gallagher issued 18000 shares of its common stock paid 201 million in cash and accrued 52 million in current liabilities related to earnout obligations of thirteen acquisitions made prior to 2008 and recorded additional goodwill of 235 million during 2007 gallagher issued 322000 shares of its common stock paid 217 million in cash and accrued 17 million in current liabilities related to earnout obligations of fourteen acquisitions made prior to 2007 and recorded additional goodwill of 264 million 

  

gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth in revenues and earnings in its brokerage segment while gallagher intends to continue to seek to complete acquisitions its ability to do so using cash may be inhibited in light of current conditions in the economy and financial markets and there can be no assurance that gallagher’s level of acquisition activity and growth from acquisitions will be consistent with past levels 

for a further discussion of risks associated with gallagher’s acquisition activity see item 1a “risk factors” 

dispositions  during 2008 gallagher signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of its reinsurance brokerage business under the agreements gallagher received initial proceeds of 331 million and potential additional proceeds of up to 146 million that are based on revenues relating to risks attaching on reinsurance agreements placed in the twelvemonth period after the closing dates of the respective agreements with the express intention that gallagher be credited with eighteen months of revenues in respect of any risk attaching in such twelvemonth period these contingent proceeds can be adjusted for any changes ie premium audits made to the underlying revenues during the thirtymonth periods subsequent to the anniversary dates of the respective agreements in january 2009 gallagher signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of its us reinsurance brokerage business under the agreement gallagher transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 gallagher sold several small books of business and recognized onetime gains of 116 million 238 million and 71 million respectively which approximated the cash proceeds received related to these transactions 

outlook  gallagher believes it has sufficient capital to meet its short and longterm cash flow needs except for 2008 and 2005 gallagher’s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have increased year over year since 1991 in 2008 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations severance litigation impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation in 2005 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations gallagher expects the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to continue in the foreseeable future because it intends to continue to expand its business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions additionally gallagher anticipates that it will continue to use cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under the credit agreement and its common stock to fund acquisitions in addition gallagher may from timetotime consider other alternatives for longerterm funding sources such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt markets equity markets or restructuring its operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with its investing and operating activities gallagher has entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 8 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments gallagher’s future minimum cash payments excluding interest associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its note purchase agreements and credit agreement operating leases and purchase commitments at december 31 2009 were as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect gallagher’s actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with gallagher’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2009 gallagher is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 450 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

note purchase agreements  on august 3 2007 gallagher entered into a note purchase agreement as amended and restated on december 31 2007 with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which gallagher issued and sold 1000 million in aggregate principal amount of gallagher’s 626 senior notes series a due august 3 2014 and 3000 million in aggregate principal amount of gallagher’s 644 senior notes series b due august 3 2017 in a private placement 

  

on november 30 2009 gallagher entered into a note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which gallagher issued and sold 1500 million in aggregate principal amount of gallagher’s 585 senior notes series c due in three equal installments on each of november 30 2016 november 30 2018 and november 30 2019 in a private placement 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements 

credit agreement  gallagher has a 4500 million credit agreement which expires on october 4 2010 that it uses to post locs and that it can use from timetotime to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows at december 31 2009 140 million of locs for which gallagher has 80 million of liabilities recorded at december 31 2009 were outstanding under the credit agreement there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2009 accordingly at december 31 2009 4360 million remained available for potential borrowings of which 1110 million may be in the form of additional locs gallagher is under no obligation to utilize the credit agreement in performing its normal business operations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 

operating lease obligations  gallagher generally operates in leased premises at its other locations certain office space leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 

gallagher has leased certain office space to several nongallagher tenants under operating sublease arrangements in the normal course of business gallagher expects that the leases will not be renewed or replaced charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance are adjusted annually based on actual expenses and the related revenues are recognized in the year in which the expenses are incurred these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 

outstanding purchase obligations  gallagher is a service company and thus typically does not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that gallagher has outstanding at december 31 2009 these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  gallagher’s total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and funding commitments at december 31 2009 were as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of gallagher’s funding commitments related to its financial services and corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other locs all of the locs represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 gallagher acquired 137 companies all of which were accounted for using the purchase accounting method for recording business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations for all of its 2009 acquisitions that contain potential earnout obligations such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition the maximum earnout obligations related to the 2009 acquisitions are disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements which represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the purchase agreements related to the applicable acquisitions these amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to threeyear period subsequent to the acquisition date for acquisitions made prior to 2009 potential earnout obligations were not included in the purchase price that was recorded for each applicable acquisition at its respective acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable future payments made under these arrangements if any will generally be recorded as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled the aggregate amount of unrecorded earnout payables outstanding at december 31 2009 was 2394 million and related to acquisitions made by gallagher in the period from 2006 to 2008 

  

offbalance sheet debt  gallagher’s unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where gallagher’s ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that gallagher’s level of economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation substantially all of these investments are accounted for using the equity method based on the legal form of gallagher’s ownership interest and the applicable percentage of the entity owned none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2009 and 2008 that was recourse to gallagher 

at december 31 2009 gallagher had posted two locs totaling 83 million in the aggregate related to gallagher’s selfinsurance deductibles for which it had a recorded liability of 80 million gallagher has an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility which gallagher uses as a placement facility for certain of its insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2009 gallagher had posted 57 million of locs to allow the rentacaptive facility to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity these locs have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

gallagher is exposed to various market risks in its daytoday operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by gallagher at december 31 2009 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects gallagher’s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from gallagher’s estimates in the ordinary course of business gallagher also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

gallagher’s invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of gallagher’s cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio at december 31 2009 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from the carrying values at december 31 2009 

gallagher has other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions which can change rapidly in addition some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from gallagher a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if gallagher elects to withdraw financial or operational support 

at december 31 2009 gallagher had 5500 million of borrowings outstanding under its note purchase agreements the aggregate fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2009 was 5660 million due to their longterm duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations there is no active or observable market for gallagher’s private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate an allin interest rate for discounting market quotes were obtained for notes with the same terms as gallagher’s there is no rate adjustment for the risk profile changes covenant issues or credit rating changes at gallagher and therefore the market quotes are deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates market risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in gallagher’s weighted average borrowing rate at december 31 2009 and the resulting fair values would be 326 million higher than their carrying value 

at december 31 2009 gallagher had no borrowings outstanding under its credit agreement however in the event that gallagher does have borrowings outstanding the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates market risk would be estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in gallagher’s weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2009 and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying value 

gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from its uk based subsidiaries that incur expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of their revenues in us dollars in addition gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from its australian and canadian operations due to transacting business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as they are incurred assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2009 a weakening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would decrease by approximately 16 million assuming a hypothetical favorable change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2009 a strengthening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately 29 million gallagher is also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated 

  

with the translation of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars however it is management’s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to gallagher’s consolidated operating results or financial position gallagher manages the balance sheets of its foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets thereby maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations historically gallagher has rarely entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for hedging trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk gallagher has periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize its exposure to this risk the impact of this hedging strategy was not material to gallagher’s consolidated financial statements for 2009 2008 and 2007

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine gallagher’s profitability 

gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for its brokerage services gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example for several years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market which in turn put downward pressure on gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas 

  

beginning in late 2000 the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing because of the events of september 11 th  many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased in some cases dramatically beginning in late 2003 the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas while the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rateprice sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines the higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007 because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing which gallagher cannot predict or control its brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as gallagher those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect gallagher’s profitability because gallagher does not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes gallagher cannot accurately forecast its commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result gallagher’s budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of its operations 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from its traditional brokerage activities 

gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in one or more areas of its business gallagher competes with three firms that are as large as or significantly larger than gallagher in terms of revenues in the global risk management and brokerage markets in addition there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office that is as large as or larger than in terms of revenues the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect gallagher’s business 

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect gallagher these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for gallagher’s products and services to change which could in turn adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

gallagher’s businesses and therefore its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the current disruption in the global credit markets and instability of financial systems 

gallagher’s business and therefore its results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected by the current disruption in the us based credit markets and instability of financial systems 

the current disruption in the us based credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets in recent months such volatility has reached unprecedented levels and credit markets have been illiquid these conditions have resulted in the failure of a number of financial institutions and unprecedented action by governmental authorities and central banks around the world including investing in or lending money to financial institutions and insurance companies that are perceived to need additional capital it is difficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which gallagher’s markets products and business will be adversely affected 

these unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies although gallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility which expires in 2010 and is not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of its lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend gallagher credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect its ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact gallagher’s ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 

gallagher also has a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties gallagher could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to gallagher which could have a significant adverse impact on gallagher’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the agreements and instruments governing gallagher’s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact gallagher’s ability to operate its business 

the agreements governing gallagher’s debt contain covenants that among other things restrict gallagher’s ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change gallagher’s business or make investments 

the restrictions in the agreements governing gallagher’s debt may prevent it from taking actions that it believes would be in the best interest of gallagher’s business and its stockholders and may make it difficult for gallagher to execute its business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted gallagher may also incur future debt obligations that might subject it to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect gallagher’s financial and operational flexibility gallagher cannot make any assurances that it will be able to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to gallagher or at all 

gallagher’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing gallagher’s debt may be affected by economic financial and industry conditions beyond gallagher’s control the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest 

gallagher could incur substantial losses if one of the commercial banks and financial institutions gallagher uses in its operations would happen to fail 

gallagher maintains cash balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts and in some cases in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits at various depository institutions gallagher also maintains cash balances in foreign banks and institutions although gallagher has moved substantially all of its us funds into accounts insured or guaranteed by government programs there are foreign operations where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs as the worldwide fallout from the credit crisis persists the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue if one or more of the depository institutions in which gallagher maintains significant cash balances were to fail gallagher’s ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and gallagher could face a significant liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses 

  

gallagher has historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions 

in the past several years gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in gallagher achieving slower growth various factors may affect gallagher’s ability to attract acquisition targets including gallagher’s inability to continue certain contingent commission compensation structures particularly in light of the fact that most other companies in the insurance brokerage industry are not limited in this manner moreover even if gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions thereby negatively affecting gallagher’s results of operations or leading to unanticipated contingent liabilities and losses 

gallagher faces a variety of risks in its risk management operations that are distinct from those it faces in its brokerage operations 

gallagher’s risk management business has somewhat less exposure to the hard and soft market cycles described above to which gallagher’s brokerage business is exposed however it faces a variety of other risks which are unique to its operations including 

 

  

  

  

 gallagher has significant nonus operations which expose it to certain additional risks including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk 

a significant portion of gallagher’s operations is conducted outside the us accordingly gallagher is subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries operating in these countries may present risks that are different from or greater than the risks to gallagher of doing comparable business in the us gallagher’s international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

some of gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although gallagher has used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations 

gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations for example gallagher uses thirdparty service providers located in india for certain back office services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected gallagher’s operations in india however such factors could potentially affect gallagher’s operations or ability to utilize thirdparty providers in the future should gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

changes in gallagher’s accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect its financial position and operating results 

gallagher prepares its financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these accounting principles require gallagher to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its consolidated financial statements gallagher is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period gallagher periodically evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those relating to the valuation of intangible assets investments income taxes stockbased compensation claims handling obligations retirement plans litigation and contingencies gallagher bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that gallagher believes to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates additionally changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on gallagher’s future financial position results of operations and cash flows 

gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide if gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects gallagher’s operations gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable 

many of gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary actions that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of gallagher’s authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from timetotime require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder gallagher’s ability to operate its business 

government sponsored insurance programs may seriously undermine gallagher’s profitability 

it is possible that federal and state governments will create pc or health related insurance programs that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers development of these governmentsponsored insurance programs could adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

gallagher is subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to gallagher would adversely affect its financial results 

gallagher is subject to numerous claims tax assessments lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that its employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that gallagher holds for its clients on a fiduciary basis gallagher has established provisions against these potential matters which it believes to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice and gallagher adjusts such provisions from timetotime based on current material developments the damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial including in many instances claims for punitive treble or extraordinary damages it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to gallagher it could materially adversely affect its future financial results in addition gallagher’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future gallagher’s insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which it selfinsures gallagher has purchased errors and omissions eo insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters accruals for these items net of insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from timetotime as current developments warrant 

  

as more fully described in note 17 to gallagher’s 2008 consolidated financial statements gallagher is subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on gallagher’s business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on gallagher by exposing it to negative publicity reputational damage harm to gallagher’s client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources 

gallagher is subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent broker compensation practices further proceedings could adversely affect gallagher’s financial strength and results of operations 

since late 2004 the insurance industry in general and gallagher individually have been subject to significant scrutiny by various state attorneys general state insurance departments and private litigants with respect to broker compensation practices generally known as contingent commission arrangements or placement service agreements between insurance brokers and insurance carriers 

on may 18 2005 gallagher resolved with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois an investigation into broker compensation practices gallagher believes that this settlement was intended to be on behalf of all state attorneys general and all state insurance departments however there can be no assurance that other states will honor this agreement 

on december 29 2006 gallagher reached an agreement to resolve all claims in the mdl on september 4 2007 the court granted final approval of the mdl settlement the mdl settlement provides for gallagher to distribute 280 million to current and former clients and others that purchased retail insurance through gallagher or other brokers named as defendants in the mdl during the period beginning on august 26 1994 and ending on december 31 2005 gallagher also agreed to pay up to 89 million in attorney fees of which gallagher paid 86 million in november 2007 a notice of appeal has been filed challenging the final approval of the mdl settlement a hearing on the appeal is scheduled for april 20 2009 in the event that the final approval by the court is not upheld gallagher may incur significant additional legal costs and face potential liability in connection with the litigation 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained future litigation and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on gallagher gallagher’s future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition even if gallagher does not experience significant monetary costs there has been and may continue to be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to gallagher or to the insurance brokerage industry in general that may adversely affect gallagher’s business 

for a more detailed discussion of these matters refer to note 17 to gallagher’s 2008 consolidated financial statements 

gallagher’s results may be adversely affected relative to its competitors that can accept contingent commissions 

pursuant to various agreements with insurance regulators gallagher marsh willis and aon are prohibited from accepting volumebased or profitbased contingent commissions as a retail broker there are no other brokers that are known to be similarly prohibited from accepting these types of contingent commissions when gallagher acquires a retail broker that broker may continue to accept contingent commissions for a three year period after the acquisition date gallagher’s restrictions on accepting contingent commissions may significantly undermine gallagher’s operating results profitability liquidity and its ability to reinvest in its business relative to its competitors that can accept contingent commissions 

gallagher’s future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

gallagher believes that its future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including its senior management brokers and other key personnel the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of any of its senior managers brokers or other key personnel or its inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition 

  

gallagher has historically benefited from section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting gallagher to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to gallagher’s synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 in 2008 2007 and 2006 gallagher’s annual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was 319 227 and 169 respectively gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate for 2007 and 2006 reflects the tax credits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operated alternative energy projects irc section 29 the rates for 2008 and 2007 reflect the impact of the resolution of a number of income tax matters related to prior years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions which resulted in a net decrease in gallagher’s tax provision of 163 million and 59 million respectively accordingly gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate in 2009 and future years will likely adjust upward to be in the range of approximately 390 to 410 

gallagher believes its claim for irc section 29related related tax credits is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings plrs previously obtained by irc section 29related partnerships in which it had an interest gallagher understands these plrs are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and has received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them 

while gallagher’s synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause gallagher to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29related tax credits for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

gallagher is exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by its financial services business 

gallagher’s financial services business holds a variety of investments these investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation tax audits and disputes failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of gallagher’s invested assets and adversely affect its net worth and profitability

gallagher’s executive offices of the financial services and corporate segment and certain subsidiary and branch facilities of the brokerage and risk management segments are located at two pierce place itasca illinois where gallagher leases approximately 306000 square feet of space or approximately 60 of the building the lease commitment on this property expires on february 28 2018 

elsewhere gallagher generally operates in leased premises related to its facilities of the brokerage and risk management operations gallagher prefers to lease office space rather than own real estate certain of gallagher’s office space leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses generally related to increases in an inflation index see note 17 to gallagher’s 2008 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to gallagher’s lease commitments at december 31 2008

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with arthur j gallagher  co’s gallagher consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that are included elsewhere herein 

gallagher is engaged in providing insurance brokerage and thirdparty propertycasualty pc claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad gallagher believes that one of its major strengths is its ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to its clients gallagher’s brokers agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and gallagher does not assume underwriting risks gallagher is headquartered in itasca illinois has operations in fifteen countries and does business in more than 100 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants it generates approximately 87 of revenues domestically with the remaining 13 derived primarily in canada the united kingdom uk australia and bermuda gallagher operates three business segments brokerage risk management and financial services and corporate which contributed approximately 72 28 and less than 1 respectively to 2008 revenues the two major sources of operating revenues for gallagher are commissions and fees from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations investment income and other revenue is generated from gallagher’s investment portfolio which includes invested cash fiduciary funds tax advantaged and other investments 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 see “cautionary language regarding forwardlooking statements” on the last page of the 2008 annual report 

insurance market overview 

fluctuations in premiums charged by pc insurance carriers carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions various factors including competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations can result in flat or reduced pc premium rates a “soft” market a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues various countervailing factors such as heavier than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages can result in increasing pc premium rates a “hard” market a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues hard and soft markets may be broadbased or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 

as markets harden there historically has been resistance among certain insureds who are the buyers of insurance gallagher’s brokerage clients to pay increased premiums and the higher commissions generated by these premiums such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles andor reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase as the market softens or costs decrease these trends have historically reversed during a hard market buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate gallagher for placing their risks or may consider the alternative insurance market which includes selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk according to industry estimates these mechanisms account for almost 50 of the total us commercial pc market gallagher’s brokerage units are very active in these markets as well while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to gallagher such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management claims management captive insurance and selfinsurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

  

inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures thereby resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions however the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations historically has had a greater impact on changes in premium rates and therefore on gallagher’s revenues than inflationary pressures 

beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2008 the pc insurance market has been relatively soft in most lines and in most geographic areas notwithstanding an abnormally high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters for example surveys by the council of insurance agents  brokers ciab indicated that commercial pc rates fell sharply during first second and third quarters of 2008 the average premium decline for all commercial accounts regardless of size was 135 for first quarter 129 for second quarter and 110 for third quarter a similar survey by the ciab indicated that commercial pc rates fell again during fourth quarter 2008 by an average of 64 for all commercial accounts regardless of size however according to the most recent survey commercial pc market premiums showed signs of leveling off in fourth quarter 2008 across small medium and large accounts and for most major lines of commercial business noting that premium rate drops eased as insurers tried to hold the line on pricing the ciab believes it is still a soft market environment but the fourth quarter activity may signal the bottom of the soft market following six years of steady decline the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers who write approximately 80 of the commercial pc premiums in the us 

historically gallagher has utilized acquisitions to grow its brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues acquisitions allow gallagher to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend its presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries gallagher expects that its brokerage segment’s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions gallagher is considering and intends to continue to consider from timetotime additional acquisitions on terms that it deems advantageous at any particular time gallagher generally will be engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates however no assurances can be given that any additional acquisitions will be consummated or if consummated that they will be advantageous to gallagher 

the recent disruption in the global credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets generally particularly in the us and europe have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions including participants in the insurance industry continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets and a recessionary environment may reduce gallagher’s customers’ demand for its brokerage and risk management services and could negatively affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition additionally the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance coverages gallagher offers its brokerage customers could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which in turn could have the effect of reduced placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduced revenues and profitability for gallagher in addition the deterioration in the economy that occurred in fourth quarter 2008 could adversely impact gallagher in 2009 and future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that its clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount payroll properties market values of assets etc such reductions could also adversely impact gallagher’s 2009 commission revenues when exposure audits by the carriers are performed and subsequent downward premium adjustments are determined and become known the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known in addition some of gallagher’s clients may cease operations completely due to a prolonged deterioration in the economy 

contingent commissions and other industry developments 

the insurance industry continues to be subject to scrutiny by various regulatory bodies including state attorneys general and the departments of insurance for various states with respect to contingent compensation arrangements generally known as contingent commission or placement service arrangements and other matters the attorney general of the state of new york the new york ag issued subpoenas to various insurance brokerage firms and carriers beginning in april 2004 the investigation by the new york ag among other things led to its filing a complaint against marsh  mclennan companies inc and its subsidiary marsh inc collectively marsh stating claims for among other things fraud and violations of new york state antitrust and securities laws following these allegations marsh announced that it would permanently eliminate the practice of receiving any form of contingent compensation from carriers and shortly thereafter two other large insurance brokerage firms willis group and aon corporation made similar announcements regarding the discontinuation and unwinding of contingent commissions agreements 

on may 18 2005 gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates except for gallagher bassett services inc entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance the avc with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois collectively the il state agencies to resolve all of the issues related to certain investigations conducted by the il state agencies involving contingent commission arrangements a copy of the avc was previously disclosed as an exhibit to gallagher’s current report on form 8k dated may 18 2005 

  

as has been described in detail in gallagher’s previous filings the avc required gallagher to pay 269 million into a fund the fund to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients these payments are in full satisfaction of gallagher’s obligations under the avc and the il state agencies have agreed not to impose any other financial obligation or liability on gallagher in connection with their investigations no portion of the payments by gallagher is considered a fine or penalty at december 31 2008 86 million remained in the fund which is available to satisfy existing and future avc related claims and other potential settlement obligations as allowed by the avc gallagher intends to use all of the remaining avc funds to satisfy part of its multidistrict litigation settlement obligation see discussion below 

on or before december 31 2005 gallagher undertook certain changes to its business practices  including an agreement not to accept any contingent compensation from an insurer in connection with any retail insurance policy covering us clients or risks except as provided in the avc in addition the avc provides that gallagher may not take or receive any material compensation or consideration from an insurer except as provided in the avc as permitted under the avc gallagher has continued to accept contingent compensation in connection with its international operations and certain nonretail business including business generated by wholesalers managing general agents and managing general underwriters in addition the avc allows gallagher to collect retail contingent compensation related to contracts in place at entities acquired by gallagher for up to three years from the date of each such acquisition 

on october 19 2004 gallagher along with other major insurance brokerage firms was named as a defendant in various lawsuits brought by private litigants which relate to contingent commission arrangements certain of these lawsuits have been included in a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the us district court for the district of new jersey on december 29 2006 gallagher reached an agreement to resolve all claims in the mdl the mdl settlement on september 4 2007 the court granted final approval of the mdl settlement the mdl settlement provides for gallagher to distribute 280 million to current and former clients and others that purchased retail insurance through gallagher or other brokers named as defendants in the mdl during the period beginning on august 26 1994 and ending on december 31 2005 as part of the mdl settlement gallagher also agreed to pay up to 89 million in attorney fees of which gallagher paid 86 million in november 2007 a notice of appeal has been filed challenging the final approval of the mdl settlement a hearing on the appeal is scheduled for april 20 2009 

gallagher and its subsidiaries continue to be the subject of a number of state investigations concerning various historical business practices in the insurance industry and is fully cooperating with these investigations see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion relating to these matters 

critical accounting policies 

gallagher’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes gallagher believes the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized at the latter of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations commission revenues related to installment premiums are recognized as the installments are billed contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers are recognized as revenue when the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts have been obtained by gallagher typically these types of commission revenues cannot be reasonably determined until the cash or the related policy detail is received by gallagher from the insurance carrier a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is based on the overall profit andor volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of pc transactions each with small premiums and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by gallagher’s employee benefit operations under these direct bill arrangements the billing and policy issuance process is controlled entirely by the insurance carrier the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known 

fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized in the same manner as commission revenues fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration loss control and other risk management consulting services which are provided over a period of time typically one year these fee revenues are recognized ratably as the services are rendered the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known 

premiums and fees receivable in the consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts the allowance for estimated policy cancellations is established through a charge to revenues while the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to other operating expenses both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience gallagher periodically reviews the adequacy of these allowances and makes adjustments as necessary the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

  

income taxes 

gallagher’s tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions gallagher reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin 48 is a twostep process the first step involves recognition gallagher determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue gallagher recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

tax law requires items be included in gallagher’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for an amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly gallagher evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years positive evidences includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years the underlying assumptions gallagher uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account gallagher’s recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

intangible assets 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses gallagher classifies its intangible assets as either goodwill expiration lists or noncompete agreements expiration lists and noncompete agreements are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives five to fifteen years for expiration lists and five to six years for noncompete agreements while goodwill is not subject to amortization allocation of intangible assets between goodwill expiration lists and noncompete agreements and the determination of estimated useful lives are based on valuations gallagher receives from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization in the consolidated balance sheet 

while goodwill is not amortized it is subject to periodic reviews for impairment gallagher reviews all of its intangible assets for impairment periodically at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such impairment reviews are performed at the division level ie reporting unit with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets in reviewing intangible assets if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings based on the results of impairment reviews in 2008 2007 and 2006 gallagher wroteoff 27 million 88 million and 10 million respectively of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions the 2007 intangible asset writeoff was reported in discontinued operations in the 2007 consolidated statement of earnings the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 sfas 141r “business combinations” which is a revision of sfas 141 “business combinations” the primary requirements of sfas 141r are as follows 

 

  

  

 sfas 141 r is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2008 adoption is prospective and early adoption is not permitted effective january 1 2009 gallagher will be required on a prospective basis to estimate and record liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all future acquisitions whose purchase agreements contain such provisions subsequent changes in the estimated earnout obligations will be recorded in the statement of earnings when incurred in light of gallagher’s historical acquisition activity subsequent changes in the estimated earnout obligations could have a significant effect on gallagher’s future results of operations potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired entities and are not currently included in the purchase price that is recorded for each applicable acquisition at its acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable future payments made under these arrangements if any are generally recorded as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled and have no impact on gallagher’s statement of earnings historically gallagher has not incurred a material amount of external transaction costs related to its acquisitions however when it has incurred such costs gallagher has capitalized these costs as part of its purchase accounting effective january 1 2009 gallagher will expense all external transaction costs related to its acquisitions as incurred 

fair value of investments 

for investments that do not have quoted market prices gallagher utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value and proactively looks for indicators of impairment factors that may indicate that an impairment could exist include defaults on interest andor principal payments reductions or changes to dividend payments sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance recent refinancings or recapitalizations unfavorable press reports untimely filing of financial information significant customer or revenue loss litigation tax audits losses by other companies in a similar industry overall economic conditions management and expert advisor changes and significant changes in strategy in addition in cases where the ultimate value of an investment is directly dependent on gallagher for future financial support gallagher assesses its willingness and intent to provide future funding 

if an indicator of impairment exists gallagher compares the investment’s carrying value to an estimate of its fair value to estimate the fair value of its equity investments gallagher compares values established in recent recapitalizations or appraisals conducted by third parties in some cases no such recapitalizations or appraisals exist and gallagher must perform its own valuations this also requires gallagher to exercise significant judgment even if impairment indicators exist no writedown may be required if the estimated fair value is not less than the current carrying value or the decline in value is determined to be temporary and gallagher has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for the value to recover when gallagher determines the decline in fair value is otherthantemporary and therefore that a writedown is required it is recorded as a realized loss against current period earnings 

both the process to review for indicators of impairment and if such indicators exist the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporate quantitative data and qualitative criteria including the receipt of new information that can significantly change the decision about the valuation of an investment in a short period of time the determination of whether a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment the timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings could vary if management’s conclusions were different 

due to the inherent risk of investments gallagher cannot give assurance that there will not be impairments in the future should economic and other conditions change 

  

business combinations and dispositions 

see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of 2008 business combinations and 2008 and 2007 dispositions respectively in addition see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on dispositions of certain gallagher consolidated investments in 2008 2007 and 2006 as applicable 

results of operations 

in the discussion that follows regarding gallagher’s results of operations gallagher provides organic growth percentages with respect to its commission and fee revenues this information may be considered a “nongaap financial measure” because it is derived from gallagher’s consolidated financial information but is not required to be presented in financial statements that are prepared in conformity with gaap rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec require supplemental explanations and reconciliations of all “nongaap financial measures” when gallagher refers to organic growth percentages with respect to its commission and fee revenues in its discussion of results of operations gallagher excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from the acquisitions and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the revenue growth that is associated with the operations that were part of gallagher in both the current and prior year in addition organic growth excludes contingent commission revenues these commission revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that will be continuing in 2008 and beyond in addition organic revenue growth excludes the impact of contingent commission revenues and foreign currency translation management has historically utilized organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of its brokerage and risk management segments management also believes that the use of this measure allows financial statement users to measure analyze and compare the growth from its brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner a reconciliation of organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the brokerage and risk management segments is presented in the paragraphs immediately following each table in which such percentages are presented 

allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue headcount and other information gallagher allocates the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were preparing income tax provisions on a separate company basis as a result the provision for income taxes for the financial services and corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to gallagher of the irc section 29related credits in 2007 and 2006 because that is the segment which produced the credits the law that provided for irc section 29related credits expired on december 31 2007 gallagher anticipates reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 390 to 410 in both its brokerage segment and its risk management segment for the foreseeable future reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

in the discussion that follows regarding gallagher’s results of operations gallagher provides the following ratios with respect to its operating results pretax profit margin before the impact of pretax retail contingent commission related matters and medical and pension plan changes compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio pretax profit margin before the impact of pretax retail contingent commission related matters and medical and pension plan changes represents pretax earnings from continuing operations before the impact of pretax retail contingent commission related matters in 2006 and the medical plan change in 2006 divided by total revenues excluding retail contingent commissions the compensation expense ratio is derived by dividing compensation expense after excluding the impact of medical and pension plan changes in 2006 by total revenues excluding retail contingent commissions the operating expense ratio is derived by dividing operating expense after excluding retail contingent commission related matters in 2006 by total revenues excluding retail contingent commissions

the primary source of gallagher’s compensation for its retail brokerage services is commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based both upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by its clients for wholesale brokerage services gallagher generally receives a share of the commission paid to the retail broker by the insurer commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether gallagher acts as a retail or wholesale broker advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services provided under certain circumstances gallagher may also receive contingent commissions which are based on the estimated profit the underwriting insurance company earns andor the overall volume of business placed by gallagher in a given period of time

the law that provided for irc section 29 tax credits expired on december 31 2007 gallagher’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 and future years will likely be approximately 390 to 410 gallagher also anticipates reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 390 to 410 in both its brokerage segment and its risk management segment for the foreseeable future the overall effective income tax rate for gallagher in 2007 and 2006 reflects the impact of tax credits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operated alternative energy projects irc section 29 which are partially offset by state and foreign taxes gallagher’s annual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was 319 227 and 169 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the rates for 2007 and 2006 reflect the impact of 67 and 33 phaseouts of irc section 29related tax credits respectively the rates for 2008 and 2007 reflect the impact of the resolution of a number of income tax matters related to prior years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions which resulted in a net decrease in gallagher’s tax provision of 163 million and 59 million respectively 

gallagher is an investor in two privatelyowned clean energy ventures 

chemmod a multipollutant reduction venture possesses rights information and technology for the reduction of unwanted emissions created during the combustion of coal chemmod has developed and is the exclusive licensee of a new proprietary emissions technology it refers to as the chemmod™ solution which uses a dual injection sorbent system to reduce mercury sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions at coalfired power plants although chemmod is in the early stages of commercializing the technology the principal potential market for the chemmod™ solution is coalfired power plants owned by utility companies on october 17 2007 chemmod signed its first commercial license agreement with a utility company for use of the chemmod™ solution gallagher through a whollyowned subsidiary initially owned a 10 direct equity interest in chemmod and had an option to acquire an additional 32 indirect equity interest in chemmod on december 28 2007 gallagher exercised onehalf of its option for 55 million to acquire an additional indirect ownership interest of 16 from existing owners of chemmod on may 23 2008 gallagher exercised a portion of its option for 250000 to acquire an additional indirect ownership interest of 07 from existing owners of chemmod on august 18 2008 gallagher exercised the remaining portion of its option for 53 million to acquire an additional indirect ownership interest of 153 from existing owners of chemmod effective august 18 2008 gallagher now has a 42 direct and indirect ownership interest in chemmod and is required to consolidate its operations into gallagher’s consolidated financial statements prior to august 18 2008 these ownership interests in chemmod were accounted for using equity method accounting in addition gallagher through a whollyowned subsidiary owns a 20 direct equity interest in chemmod international llc the exclusive licensee of the chemmod™ solution on a global basis excluding the us and canada gallagher’s interests in chemmod and chemmod international llc are collectively referred to herein as chemmod interests gallagher first began providing funding to chemmod in june 2004 chemmod continues to test and market its technology in an effort to secure more commercial licenses while gallagher currently believes that its chemmod interests may prove to have substantial value there can be no assurance given as to timing or amount if any with respect to any realization on this investment 

  

on april 19 2006 gallagher funded 47 million related to another clean energy venture formed by the founders of chemmod cquest cquest possesses rights information and technology for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels gallagher through a whollyowned subsidiary currently owns a 5 direct equity interest in cquest and has an option to acquire an additional 22 direct interest in cquest in addition gallagher through a whollyowned subsidiary currently owns a 5 direct equity interest in cquest international and has an option to acquire an additional 22 direct interest in cquest international which possesses rights to use information and technology of cquest on a global basis excluding the us and canada the equity interest and option rights in cquest and cquest international are collectively referred to herein as cquest interests currently gallagher’s carrying value with respect to its cquest interests is 01 million gallagher’s options to acquire the additional 22 direct interest in cquest and cquest international are exercisable at any time on or prior to april 18 2010 at an exercise price of 55 million for each option 110 million total while gallagher currently believes that its cquest interests may prove to have substantial value there can be no assurance given as to timing or amount if any with respect to any realization on this investment 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive historically gallagher’s capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on its common stock repurchases of its common stock funding of its investments acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities 

historically gallagher has depended on its ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet its cash requirements however to fund acquisitions made during 2008 gallagher relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings under its credit agreement management believes that gallagher will have adequate resources to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities was 1606 million 2523 million and 1047 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to interest paid on the 4000 million of notes issued under the note purchase agreement an increase in incentive compensation payments an increase in errors and omissions claim payments and a decrease in operating earnings generated from the brokerage and risk management operations the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the 921 million of payments made in first quarter 2006 related to a 2005 litigation settlement and to the 269 million gallagher paid into a fund in first quarter 2006 to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients under the avc gallagher’s cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from its earnings from operations as adjusted for realized gains and losses and its noncash expenses which include depreciation amortization deferred compensation restricted stock and stockbased compensation expenses 

when assessing the overall liquidity of gallagher the focus should be on earnings from operations adjusted for noncash items in the statement of earnings and cash provided by operating activities in the statement of cash flows as indicators of trends in liquidity from a balance sheet perspective the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable net cash flows provided by operations may vary substantially from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear related to these items in order to consider these items in assessing trends in liquidity for gallagher they should be looked at in a combined manner because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments both to and from gallagher in addition funds legally restricted as to gallagher’s use relating to premiums and clients’ claim funds held as fiduciary funds are presented in gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet as “restricted cash” and have not been included in determining gallagher’s overall liquidity 

gallagher’s policy for funding its defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the plan in 2008 or in 2009 contribution rates are determined by the plan’s actuaries based on funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of gallagher’s cash flows including dividends acquisitions and common stock repurchases 

gallagher recognizes in its consolidated balance sheet an asset for its defined benefit postretirement plans’ overfunded status or a liability for its plans’ underfunded status gallagher recognizes changes in the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in comprehensive earnings in the year in which the changes occur see notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed related to its defined benefit postretirement plans gaap requires that gallagher recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of its underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans the plans as an accrued benefit plan liability the offsetting adjustment to the amount of liabilities required to be recognized is recorded 

  

in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss net of tax in gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate the change in funded status of the plans is impacted by numerous items including actual results compared with prior estimates and assumptions and changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates in 2008 the funded status of gallagher’s plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2008 reflecting a general widening of credit spreads on high quality corporate debt obligations and negative asset returns the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a reduction in noncurrent assets of 148 million and an increase in noncurrent liabilities of 561 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 287 million and a reduction of gallagher’s stockholders’ equity of 422 million in 2008 while the change in funded status of the plans had no impact on gallagher’s cash flows from operations in 2008 or 2007 changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in its pension plan have an effect on gallagher’s capital position and could require gallagher to make significant contributions to its defined benefit pension plan and increase its pension expense in future periods 

cash flows from financing activities 

at december 31 2008 gallagher had 4000 million of corporate related borrowings outstanding under its note purchase agreement and a cash and cash equivalent balance of 1944 million gallagher also has a 4500 million credit agreement it uses from timetotime to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement there were 1320 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2008 due to outstanding letters of credit and borrowings 3049 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2008 

in third quarter 2007 gallagher entered into a note purchase agreement as amended with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which gallagher issued and sold to the investors 4000 million in aggregate debt see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreement during 2008 gallagher borrowed and repaid 2320 million and 1000 million respectively under the credit agreement principal uses of the 2008 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in 2008 and earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2008 during 2007 and 2006 gallagher borrowed and repaid 2839 million and 370 million respectively under the credit agreement principal uses of the borrowings under the credit agreement in 2007 were to fund acquisitions and earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to 2007 and to fund stock repurchases borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement in 2007 were fully repaid in third quarter 2007 using proceeds from the note purchase agreement the remaining net proceeds from the note purchase agreement were principally used for acquisitions and stock repurchases principal uses of the borrowings under the credit agreement in 2006 were used to fund gallagher’s shortterm cash flow needs and were fully repaid in third quarter 2006 using cash flows from operations 

the note purchase agreement and the credit agreement contain various covenants that require gallagher to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios gallagher was in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2008 

unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets particularly in the us and europe have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies these disruptions could make it more difficult for gallagher to obtain financing for its operations or investments or increase its cost of obtaining financing 

although gallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility and is not aware of any issues currently impacting the ability or willingness of the lenders under its revolving credit facility to honor their commitment to extend credit the us and global credit crisis could adversely affect its ability to borrow on its revolving credit facility in the future 

gallagher also has a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties gallagher could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to gallagher which could have a significant adverse impact on gallagher’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

for a further discussion of risks associated with gallagher’s financing activity see item 1a “risk factors” 

dividends  gallagher’s dividend policy is determined by the board of directors dividends are declared on a quarterly basis by the board of directors after consideration of gallagher’s available cash from earnings its anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 

in 2008 gallagher declared 1212 million in cash dividends on its common stock or 128 per common share on january 15 2009 gallagher paid a fourth quarter dividend of 32 per common share to shareholders of record at december 31 2008 a 33 increase over the fourth quarter dividend per share in 2007 on january 29 2009 gallagher announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter of 2009 of 32 per common share if the dividend is maintained at 32 per common share throughout 2009 this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2009 of approximately 1234 million based on the outstanding shares as of december 31 2008 or an increase in cash used of approximately 49 million 

  

common stock repurchases  gallagher has a common stock repurchase plan that has been approved by the board of directors under the plan gallagher did not repurchase any shares in 2008 and repurchased 92 million shares at a cost of 2608 million and 11 million shares at a cost of 313 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively repurchased shares are generally held for reissuance in connection with gallagher’s equity compensation and stock option plans under the provisions of the repurchase plan at december 31 2008 gallagher was authorized to repurchase approximately 100 million additional shares the plan authorizes the repurchase of gallagher’s common stock at such times and prices as gallagher may deem advantageous in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions gallagher is under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at gallagher’s discretion funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources including cash from operations shortterm or longterm borrowings under gallagher’s credit agreement or other sources the common stock repurchases reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2008 include 55000 shares at a cost of 13 million that were repurchased by gallagher from its employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with 2008 restricted stock distributions under these circumstances gallagher will withhold the proceeds from the repurchases and remit them to the taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations the common stock repurchases reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2007 also include 37000 shares at a cost of 10 million that were repurchased by gallagher from its employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with 2007 restricted stock distributions the common stock repurchases reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2006 also include 23000 shares at a cost of 07 million that were repurchased by gallagher to settle escrow obligations in connection with two acquisitions made prior to 2006 and 47000 shares at a cost of 13 million that were repurchased from its employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with 2006 restricted stock distributions 

another source of liquidity to gallagher is the issuance of its common stock pursuant to its stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from issuance of common stock under these plans were 226 million in 2008 222 million in 2007 and 241 million in 2006 gallagher has four stock option plans for officers and key employees of gallagher and its subsidiaries in may 2008 all of these stock option plans expired and thus gallagher can no longer grant any new stock options under these plans all remaining shares that were available for grant under these plans at the date of expiration 37 million shares have expired the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of 10 per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant in addition gallagher has an employee stock purchase plan espp which allowed gallagher’s employees to purchase its common stock at 85 of its fair market value effective january 1 2009 the espp was amended such that eligible employees will be allowed to purchase its common stock at 95 of its fair market value for all periods prior to january 1 2009 gallagher recognized compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the espp effective january 1 2009 gallagher will no longer recognize any compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the espp proceeds from the issuance of its common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities and gallagher believes this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future but at reduced levels from what occurred historically 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures  net capital expenditures were 320 million 407 million and 330 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2009 gallagher expects total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately 400 million primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment the decrease in net capital expenditures in 2008 from 2007 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2007 

acquisitions  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 2742 million 2150 million and 808 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 was due to the increase in the number of acquisitions made in each respective year gallagher completed thirtyseven twentyone and eleven acquisitions in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

during 2008 gallagher issued 18000 shares of its common stock paid 201 million in cash and accrued 52 million in current liabilities related to earnout obligations of thirteen acquisitions made prior to 2008 and recorded additional goodwill of 235 million during 2007 gallagher issued 322000 shares of its common stock paid 217 million in cash and accrued 17 million in current liabilities related to earnout obligations of fourteen acquisitions made prior to 2007 and recorded additional goodwill of 264 million during 2006 gallagher issued 136000 shares of its common stock paid 89 million in cash and accrued 70 million in current liabilities related to earnout obligations of fifteen acquisitions made prior to 2006 and recorded additional goodwill of 170 million 

gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth in revenues and earnings in its brokerage segment while gallagher intends to continue to seek to complete acquisitions its ability to do so using cash may be inhibited in light of current conditions in the economy and financial markets and there can be no assurance that gallagher’s level of acquisition activity and growth from acquisitions will be consistent with past levels 

for a further discussion of risks associated with gallagher’s acquisition activity see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

dispositions  during 2008 gallagher signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of its reinsurance brokerage business under the agreements gallagher received initial proceeds of 318 million in cash and a 13 million note receivable to be paid by december 31 2008 which was collected in full prior to december 31 2008 and potential proceeds of 146 million that are based on revenues generated in the twelve months subsequent to march 2008 in january 2009 gallagher signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining runoff obligations of the us reinsurance brokerage business under the agreement gallagher transferred restricted cash of 107 million receivables of 1287 million and liabilities of 1394 million to the buyer 

prior to january 25 2007 gallagher owned 90 of an airplane leasing company that leases two cargo airplanes to the french postal service on december 22 2006 gallagher agreed to sell its 90 interest in the airplane leasing company and recognized a 27 million pretax loss in the financial services and corporate segment in its 2006 consolidated financial statements on january 25 2007 the transaction closed and gallagher received cash of 07 million and extinguished related debt of 279 million on december 7 2006 the real estate partnership that owned gallagher’s home office land and building in which gallagher has a 60 ownership interest sold gallagher’s home office land and building as a result of the sale gallagher received cash proceeds of 79 million extinguished related debt of 752 million and recognized a 42 million pretax loss in the financial services and corporate segment 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 gallagher sold several small books of business and recognized onetime gains of 238 million 71 million and 45 million respectively which approximated the cash proceeds received related to these transactions 

gallagher believes it has sufficient capital to meet its short and longterm cash flow needs except for 2008 and 2005 gallagher’s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have increased year over year since 1991 in 2008 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations severance litigation impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation in 2005 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations gallagher expects the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to continue in the foreseeable future because it intends to continue to expand its business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions additionally gallagher anticipates that it will continue to use cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under the credit agreement to fund acquisitions and stock repurchases in addition gallagher may from timetotime consider other alternatives for longerterm funding sources such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt markets equity markets or restructuring its operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business 

contractual obligations and commitments 

in connection with its investing and operating activities gallagher has entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments see notes 8 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments gallagher’s future minimum cash payments excluding interest associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its note purchase agreement credit agreement investment related borrowings operating leases and purchase commitments at december 31 2008 were as follows in millions 

 

 the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect gallagher’s actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation in addition due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with gallagher’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 gallagher is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements will be made with the respective taxing authorities therefore 497 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

note purchase agreement  on august 3 2007 gallagher entered into a note purchase agreement as amended and restated on december 31 2007 with certain accredited institutional investors the purchasers pursuant to which gallagher issued and sold to the purchasers 1000 million in aggregate principal amount of gallagher’s 626 senior notes series a due august 3 2014 and 3000 million in aggregate principal amount of gallagher’s 644 senior notes series b due august 3 2017 in a private placement see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreement 

  

credit agreement  gallagher has a 4500 million credit agreement which expires on october 4 2010 that it uses to post locs and that it can use from timetotime to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows at december 31 2008 131 million of locs for which gallagher has 50 million of liabilities recorded at december 31 2008 were outstanding under the credit agreement there were 1320 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2008 accordingly at december 31 2008 3049 million remained available for potential borrowings of which 1119 million may be in the form of additional locs gallagher is under no obligation to utilize the credit agreement in performing its normal business operations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 

operating lease obligations  gallagher generally operates in leased premises at its other locations certain office space leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods in addition to minimum fixed rentals a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 

gallagher has leased certain office space to several nongallagher tenants under operating sublease arrangements in the normal course of business gallagher expects that the leases will not be renewed or replaced charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance are adjusted annually based on actual expenses and the related revenues are recognized in the year in which the expenses are incurred these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 

outstanding purchase obligations  gallagher is a service company and thus typically does not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that gallagher has outstanding at december 31 2008 these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet commitments  gallagher’s total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and funding commitments at december 31 2008 were as follows in millions 

 

 since commitments may expire unused the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of gallagher’s funding commitments related to its financial services and corporate segment and the offbalance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other locs all of the locs represent multiple year commitments that have annual automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 

since january 1 2002 gallagher acquired onehundred twentytwo companies all of which were accounted for as business combinations substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain earnout obligations the earnout obligations related to the 2008 acquisitions are disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements which represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the purchase agreements related to the applicable acquisitions these potential earnout obligations represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the purchase agreements related to the applicable acquisitions these potential earnout obligations are primarily based upon future earnings of the acquired entities and were not included in the purchase price that was recorded for these acquisitions at their respective acquisition dates future payments made under these arrangements will generally be recorded as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled the aggregate amount of unrecorded earnout payables outstanding at december 31 2008 was 2915 million and related to acquisitions made by gallagher in the period from 2005 to 2008 

offbalance sheet debt  gallagher’s unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where gallagher’s ownership interest is between 1 and 50 in which management has determined that gallagher’s level of economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation as a result these investments are accounted for using either the lower of amortized costcost or fair value or the equity method as appropriate depending on the legal form of gallagher’s ownership interest and the applicable percentage of the entity owned none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31 2008 and 2007 that was recourse to gallagher 

  

at december 31 2008 gallagher had posted two locs totaling 74 million in the aggregate related to gallagher’s selfinsurance deductibles for which it had a recorded liability of 50 million gallagher has an equity investment in a rentacaptive facility formed in 1997 which gallagher uses as a placement facility for certain of its insurance brokerage operations at december 31 2008 gallagher had posted 57 million of locs to allow the rentacaptive facility to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity these locs have never been drawn upon 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

gallagher is exposed to various market risks in its daytoday operations market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by gallagher at december 31 2008 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects gallagher’s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period this discussion of market risks related to gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from gallagher’s estimates in the ordinary course of business gallagher also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable including credit risk and legal risk these risks are not included in the following analyses 

gallagher’s invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk the fair value of gallagher’s cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio at december 31 2008 approximated its carrying value due to its shortterm duration market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio the resulting fair values were not materially different from the carrying values at december 31 2008 

gallagher has other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions which can change rapidly in addition some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from gallagher a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if gallagher elects to withdraw financial or operational support 

at december 31 2008 gallagher had 4000 million of borrowings outstanding under its note purchase agreement the fair value of these borrowings at december 31 2008 was 3577 million due to their longterm duration and fixed interest rates there is no active or observable market for gallagher’s private placement longterm debt therefore the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate an allin interest rate for discounting a broker quote was obtained for notes with the same terms as gallagher’s there is no rate adjustment for the risk profile changes covenant issues or credit rating changes at gallagher therefore the broker quote is deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates market risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in gallagher’s weighted average borrowing rate at december 31 2008 and the resulting fair values would be 249 million higher than their carrying value 

at december 31 2008 gallagher had 1320 million of borrowings outstanding under its credit agreement the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their shortterm duration and variable interest rates market risk would be estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical onepercentage point decrease in gallagher’s weighted average shortterm borrowing rate at december 31 2008 and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying value 

gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from its uk based subsidiaries that incur expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of their revenues in us dollars in addition gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from its canadian and australian operations due to transacting business in their local denominated currencies foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as they are incurred assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for 2008 a weakening of the us dollar earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately 06 million gallagher is also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars however it is management’s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to gallagher’s consolidated operating results or financial position gallagher manages the balance sheets of its foreign subsidiaries where practical such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets thereby maintaining a “balanced book” which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations historically gallagher has rarely entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for hedging trading or speculative purposes however with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk gallagher has periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize its exposure to this risk the impact of this hedging strategy was not material to gallagher’s consolidated financial statements for 2008 2007 and 2006

gallagher’s risk management operations generally have not been subject to the investigations affecting the brokerage business however gallagher has received subpoenas regarding its risk management operations from the offices of the attorney general of the states of new york connecticut and illinois the subpoenas request information in connection with separate investigations being conducted by each state and none of the subpoenas relate to gallagher’s brokerage operations gallagher continues to fully cooperate with these investigations 

  

business combinations 

gallagher has completed and integrated 183 acquisitions in the period from 1985 through december 31 2007 almost exclusively within its brokerage segment the majority of the acquisitions over this twentythree year period have been smaller regional or local pc retail or wholesale operations possessing a strong middlemarket client focus or significant expertise in one of gallagher’s focus market areas over the last decade gallagher has also increased its acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas acquisition prices typically fall within the 2 million to 30 million range

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine gallagher’s profitability 

gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for its brokerage services gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example for an extended period of years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market which in turn put downward pressure on gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas 

beginning in late 2000 the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing because of the events of september 11 th  many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased in some cases dramatically beginning in late 2003 the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas while the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rateprice sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing which gallagher cannot predict or control its brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time 

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from its traditional brokerage activities 

government sponsored insurance programs may seriously undermine gallagher’s profitability 

it is possible that federal and state governments will create pc or health related insurance programs that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers development of these government sponsored insurance programs could in turn adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

gallagher’s results may be adversely affected relative to its competitors that can accept contingent commissions 

pursuant to various agreements with insurance regulators gallagher marsh willis and aon are prohibited from accepting volumebased or profitbased contingent commissions as a retail broker there are no other brokers that are known to be similarly prohibited from accepting these types of contingent commissions when gallagher acquires a broker that broker may continue to accept contingent commissions for a three year period after the acquisition date gallagher’s restrictions on accepting contingent commissions may significantly undermine gallagher’s operating results profitability liquidity and its ability to reinvest in its business relative to its competitors that can accept contingent commissions 

  

gallagher is subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent broker compensation practices further proceedings could adversely affect gallagher’s financial strength and results of operations 

since late 2004 the insurance industry in general and gallagher individually have been subject to significant scrutiny by various state attorneys general state insurance departments and private litigants with respect to broker compensation practices generally known as contingent commission arrangements or placement service agreements between insurance brokers and insurance carriers 

on may 18 2005 gallagher resolved with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois an investigation into broker compensation practices gallagher believes that this settlement was intended to be on behalf of all state attorneys general and all state insurance departments however there can be no assurance that other states will honor this agreement 

on december 29 2006 gallagher reached an agreement to resolve all claims in the mdl on september 4 2007 the court granted final approval of the mdl settlement the mdl settlement provides for gallagher to distribute 280 million to current and former clients and others that purchased retail insurance through gallagher or other brokers named as defendants in the mdl during the period beginning on august 26 1994 and ending on december 31 2005 a notice of appeal has been filed challenging the final approval of the mdl settlement gallagher also agreed to pay up to 89 million in attorney fees of which gallagher paid 86 million in november 2007 in the event that the final approval by the court is not upheld gallagher may incur significant additional legal costs and face potential liability in connection with the litigation 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained future litigation and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on gallagher gallagher’s future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition even if gallagher does not experience significant monetary costs there has been and may continue to be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to gallagher or to the insurance brokerage industry in general that may adversely affect gallagher’s business 

for a more detailed discussion of these matters refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2007 financial statements 

gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses 

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in one or more areas of its business gallagher competes with three firms that are as large or significantly larger than gallagher in global risk management and brokerage markets in addition there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office that is as large or larger than the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect gallagher’s business 

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect gallagher these developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for gallagher’s products and services to change which could in turn adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

gallagher faces a variety of risks in its risk management operations that are distinct from those it faces in its brokerage operations 

gallagher’s risk management business has somewhat less exposure to the hard and soft market cycles described above to which gallagher’s brokerage business is exposed however it faces a variety of other risks which are unique to its operations including 

 

  

  

  

 the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 

the agreements governing gallagher’s debt contain covenants that among other things restrict gallagher’s ability to dispose of assets incur additional debt prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments pay dividends engage in certain asset sales mergers acquisitions or similar transactions create liens on assets engage in certain transactions with affiliates change gallagher’s business or make investments 

the restrictions in the agreements governing gallagher’s debt may prevent it from taking actions that it believes would be in the best interest of gallagher’s business and its stockholders and may make it difficult for gallagher to execute its business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted gallagher may also incur future debt obligations that might subject it to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect gallagher’s financial and operational flexibility gallagher cannot make any assurances that it will be able to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to gallagher or at all 

gallagher’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing gallagher’s debt may be affected by economic financial and industry conditions beyond gallagher’s control the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest 

gallagher’s business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

gallagher may be subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance or settling claims in the ordinary course of business because gallagher often assists clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against gallagher may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs 

  

gallagher purchases insurance to provide protection from errors and omissions claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business subject to selfinsured deductibles and limits as of december 31 2007 gallagher’s deductible was 50 million per claim and the overall coverage limit was 1650 million gallagher’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future its insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is a general increase in the number or amounts of claims to which gallagher is exposed gallagher’s future ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles and limits it desires may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or gallagher’s own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm gallagher’s reputation or divert management resources away from operating its business 

gallagher has historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions 

in the past several years gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in gallagher achieving slower growth various factors may affect gallagher’s ability to attract acquisition targets including gallagher’s inability to continue certain contingent commission compensation structures particularly in light of the fact that most other companies in the insurance brokerage industry are not limited in this manner moreover even if gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions thereby negatively affecting gallagher’s results of operations or leading to unanticipated contingent liabilities and losses 

gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide if gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects gallagher’s operations gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable 

many of gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary actions that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of gallagher’s authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from timetotime require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder gallagher’s ability to operate its business 

gallagher’s future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

gallagher believes that its future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including its senior management brokers and other key personnel the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of any of its senior managers brokers or other key personnel or its inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition 

gallagher has significant nonus operations which expose it to certain additional risks including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk 

a significant portion of gallagher’s operations is conducted outside the us accordingly gallagher is subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries operating in these countries may present risks that are different from or greater than the risks to gallagher of doing comparable business in the us 

some of gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although gallagher has used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations 

  

gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more stable countries gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations for example gallagher uses thirdparty service providers located in india for certain back office services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected gallagher’s operations in india however such factors could potentially affect gallagher’s operations or ability to utilize thirdparty providers in the future should gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

gallagher is exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by its financial services business 

gallagher’s financial services business holds a variety of investments these investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation tax audits and disputes failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of gallagher’s invested assets and adversely affect its net worth and profitability 

gallagher has historically benefited from section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31 2007 the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss 

the law permitting gallagher to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to gallagher’s synthetic coal operations expired on december 31 2007 in 2007 and 2006 gallagher’s annual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was 227 and 169 respectively gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate for 2007 and 2006 reflects the tax credits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operate alternative energy projects irc section 29 accordingly gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate in 2008 and future years will likely adjust upward to be in the range of approximately 390 to 410 

gallagher believes its claim for irc section 29related related tax credits is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings plrs previously obtained by irc section 29related partnerships in which it has an interest gallagher understands these plrs are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and has received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them 

however the irs is continuing to audit taxpayers claiming irc section 29related tax credits with respect to a variety of issues the partnerships in which gallagher has an interest may be audited in the future furthermore irc section 29related tax credits have been controversial both politically and administratively and no assurance can be given that the irs will not issue administrative guidance adverse to gallagher’s interests or support the enactment of legislation to curtail or repeal irc section 29 any of these potential events could adversely affect gallagher’s ability to claim irc section 29related tax credits or cause it to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29related tax credits 

while gallagher’s synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is included in gallagher’s 2007 financial statements under the caption entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and is incorporated herein by reference

the primary source of gallagher’s compensation for its brokerage segment is commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the capacity in which gallagher acts in some cases gallagher is compensated for brokerage or advisory services directly by fees from clients historically gallagher also has received contingent commissions which are based on the estimated profit the underwriting insurance company earns andor the overall volume of business placed by gallagher in a given period of time occasionally gallagher shares commissions with other brokers who have participated with gallagher in placing insurance or servicing insureds gbs receives a fee for acting in the capacity of advisor and administrator with respect to employee benefit programs and receives commissions in connection with the placement of insurance under such programs as previously reported on may 18 2005 gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates except for gallagher bassett services inc entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance the avc with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois collectively the il state agencies to resolve all of the issues related to certain investigations conducted by the il state agencies involving contingent commission arrangements as stipulated in the avc on january 12 2006 gallagher paid 269 million into a fund the fund to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients as of december 31 2006 86 million remained in the fund which is available to satisfy existing and future avc related claims and other potential settlement obligations as allowed by the avc in addition under the avc gallagher agreed to implement to the extent not previously undertaken certain business changes including agreeing not to accept usdomiciled retail contingent compensation as defined in the avc on october 26 2004 gallagher announced that it would not enter into any new volumebased or profitbased contingent commissions agreements as a retail broker effective january 1 2005 however as allowed under the avc gallagher has continued to accept contingent compensation from nonretail business including business generated by wholesalers managing general agents and managing general underwriters in addition the avc allows gallagher to collect retail contingent compensation related to contracts in place at entities acquired up to three years from the acquisition date see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2006 financial statements for a discussion of the material terms of the avc in 2005 gallagher began to experience reduced contingent commission revenue and it is expected that future contingent commission revenues will continue to be substantially reduced the reduction in retail contingent commissions as discussed above has continued to have a substantial negative impact on gallagher’s pretax earnings in 2006 and is expected to continue to have such effect on future earnings 

  

risk management 

  

the risk management segment consists of gallagher’s whollyowned subsidiary gallagher bassett services inc gb 

  

gb provides a full range of risk management services including claims management risk control consulting services information management and property appraisals on a totally integrated or select standalone basis gb provides these services for gallagher’s clients through a network of service offices located throughout the us canada england scotland and australia

in connection with its risk management services gb provides claims administration services related to “selfinsurance” programs for large institutions risk sharing pools and associations and large commercial and industrial customers selfinsurance as administered by gb is a program in which the client assumes a manageable portion of its insurance risks usually although not always placing the less predictable and larger loss exposures with an insurance carrier that specializes in these less predictable exposures

competition 

  

according to business insurance magazine july 17 2006 edition gallagher is the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in every area of its business gallagher competes with three firms that are as large or significantly larger than gallagher in global risk management and brokerage markets in addition there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office that is as large or larger than the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients 

  

gallagher is also in competition with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and hence indirectly compete with the business of gallagher 

  

regulation 

  

in every state and foreign jurisdiction in which gallagher does business gallagher andor an employee is required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in order for gallagher to conduct business in addition to licensing requirements applicable to gallagher most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance service activities be personally licensed 

  

gallagher’s insurance brokerage and risk management operations depend on its continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which it operates licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in all jurisdictions the applicable licensing laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad and general discretion as to the granting renewing and revoking of licenses and approvals 

  

as previously discussed on may 18 2005 gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates except for gallagher bassett services inc entered into the avc with the il state agencies to resolve all of the issues related to investigations conducted by the il state agencies under the avc gallagher agreed to implement to the extent not previously undertaken certain business changes including agreeing not to accept usdomiciled retail contingent compensation as defined in the avc see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2006 financial statements for a discussion of the material terms of the avc 

  

business combinations 

  

in 2006 gallagher acquired substantially all the net assets or common stock of ten insurance brokerage firms and a premium finance company ten asset purchases and one stock purchase in exchange for its common stock andor cash and accounted for them as business combinations see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2006 financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference for a summary of the 2006 acquisitions the amount and nature of the consideration paid and the dates of acquisition 

  

since december 31 2006 gallagher has completed two acquisitions which are as follows 

  

on january 5 2007 gallagher acquired substantially all of the net assets of financial profiles inc a corporation engaged in the benefits insurance business in exchange for 305000 shares of gallagher’s common stock cash of 90 million and a contingent earnout obligation of 95 million that if any is earned will be paid in cash or stock at gallagher’s election 

  

on january 25 2007 gallagher acquired substantially all of the net assets of international insurance group ltd a corporation engaged in the insurance brokerage business in exchange for shares of gallagher’s common stock with an aggregate fair value of 15 million plus the assumption of approximately 12 million of debt

gallagher believes that the net effect of these acquisitions has been and will be to expand the volume of general services rendered by gallagher and the geographical areas in which gallagher renders such services and not to change substantially the nature of the services performed by gallagher 

  

gallagher is considering and intends to consider from timetotime additional acquisitions and divestitures on terms that it deems advantageous gallagher at this time is engaged in preliminary discussions with a number of candidates for possible future acquisitions no assurances can be given that any additional acquisitions or divestitures will be consummated or if consummated will be advantageous to gallagher

 item 1a risk factors 

  

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine gallagher’s profitability 

  

gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for brokerage and risk management services gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example for an extended period of years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market which in turn put downward pressure on gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas after this period of time the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing this trend was accentuated by the events of september 11 th  following which insurance coverage in many lines became less available and premium rates increased in some cases dramatically more recently during the period from 2004 to 2006 the market softened again in many lines and in many geographic areas however the abnormally high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in those years has hardened the market in certain geographic areas and business lines because of these market fluctuations for insurance products which gallagher cannot predict or control its brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile 

  

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from its traditional brokerage activities 

  

gallagher’s results may be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully implement a new business compensation model 

  

in october 2004 gallagher announced that effective january 1 2005 it would not enter into any new volumebased or profitbased contingent commissions agreements as a retail broker in connection with the elimination of contingent commissions gallagher established a new business compensation model and commission structure that it implemented in 2005 and continues to refine there can be no assurance that it will generate incremental commission revenues equivalent to those previously received from contingent commissions the inability to generate adequate revenues from gallagher’s new business compensation model and commission structure may significantly undermine gallagher’s operating results and profitability 

  

gallagher is subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent compensation other industry practices and certain conduct which if determined unfavorably to gallagher could adversely affect its financial strength and results of operations 

  

private parties have filed civil litigation against gallagher under a variety of legal theories relating among other things to broker compensation practices gallagher is named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit pending in the circuit court of cook county illinois which challenges the propriety of alleged “undisclosed contingent commissions” paid pursuant to certain compensation arrangements between gallagher and various insurance carriers additionally gallagher is one of a number of insurance brokerage and insurance company defendants in a federal multidistrict class action litigation mdl pending before the us district court for the district of new jersey against commercial insurers and brokers relating to industrywide contingent commission matters and is party to various other litigation matters on december 29 2006 gallagher reached an agreement to resolve all claims in the mdl gallagher admitted no wrongdoing but chose to conclude its involvement rather than prolong what would have been a costly and burdensome lawsuit the mdl settlement which is subject to court approval provides for gallagher to distribute 280 million to current and former clients and others that used a broker to purchase retail insurance from 1994 to 2005 gallagher will also pay 89 million in plaintiffs’ attorney fees in the event the mdl settlement is not approved by the court gallagher may incur significant additional legal costs and face potential liability in connection with the mdl 

  

additionally the insurance industry in general and gallagher individually continue to be the subjects of a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies including state attorneys general and the departments of insurance for various states with respect to contingent commission arrangements on may 18 2005 gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates except for gallagher bassett services inc entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance the avc with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois collectively the il state agencies to resolve all of the issues related to investigations conducted by the il state agencies pursuant to which it paid 269 million into a fund to be distributed to eligible retail customers by march 31 2006 and agreed to undertake certain business changes as stipulated in the avc on january 12 2006 gallagher paid 269 million into a fund to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients as of december 31 2006 86 million remained in the fund which is available to satisfy existing and future avc related claims and other potential settlement obligations as allowed by the avc for a more detailed discussion of these matters refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2006 financial statements 

  

the ultimate outcome of the matters referred to above and similar matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on gallagher gallagher’s future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition even if gallagher does not experience significant monetary costs there has been and may continue to be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to gallagher or to the insurance brokerage industry in general that may adversely affect gallagher’s business 

  

gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses 

  

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in one or more areas of its business gallagher competes with three firms that are as large or significantly larger than gallagher in global risk management and brokerage markets in addition there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office that is as large or larger than the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect gallagher’s business 

  

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect gallagher these developments include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for gallagher’s products and services to change which could in turn adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

gallagher faces a variety of risks in its gallagher bassett services operations which are distinct from those it faces in its brokerage operations 

  

gallagher’s risk management segment which accounted for approximately 26 of gallagher’s total 2006 revenues operates primarily through its subsidiary gallagher bassett services inc gb gb is a third party administrator and risk consultant that provides a range of risk management services including claims management risk control consulting services information management and property appraisals while gb’s business has less exposure to the hard and soft market cycles described above to which gallagher’s brokerage business is exposed gb faces a variety of other risks which are unique to its operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

gallagher’s business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

  

gallagher may be subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because gallagher often assists clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against gallagher may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs 

  

gallagher purchases insurance to provide protection from errors and omissions claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business subject to selfinsured deductibles and limits as of december 31 2006 the amounts of gallagher’s deductible and limit for claims were 50 million and 1650 million respectively gallagher’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future its insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is a general increase in the number or amounts of claims to which gallagher is exposed gallagher’s future ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles and limits it desires may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or gallagher’s own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm gallagher’s reputation or divert management resources away from operating its business 

  

gallagher historically has engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions 

  

in the past several years gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in gallagher achieving slower growth various factors may affect gallagher’s ability to attract acquisition targets including gallagher’s inability to continue certain contingent commission compensation structures particularly in light of the fact that certain other companies in the insurance brokerage industry are not limited in this manner moreover even if gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner which allows gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions thereby negatively affecting gallagher’s results of operations or leading to unanticipated contingent liabilities and losses 

  

gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide if gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects gallagher’s operations gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable 

  

many of gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary action that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of gallagher’s authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from timetotime require operational changes which could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder gallagher’s ability to operate its business 

  

gallagher’s future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

  

gallagher believes that its future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including its senior management brokers and other key personnel the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of any of its senior managers brokers or other key personnel or its inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition 

  

gallagher has significant nonus operations which expose it to certain additional risks including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk 

  

a significant portion of gallagher’s operations is conducted outside the us accordingly gallagher is subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries operating in these countries may present risks that are different from or greater than risks to gallagher of doing comparable business in the us 

  

some of gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although gallagher had a foreign currency hedging strategy in 2006 such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations 

  

gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more established countries gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations for example gallagher uses thirdparty service providers located in india for certain back office services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected gallagher’s infrastructure in india however such factors could potentially affect gallagher’s infrastructure or ability to utilize thirdparty providers in the future should gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

gallagher is exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by its financial services business 

  

gallagher’s financial services business holds a variety of investments including i an interest in a holding company that holds interests in private investment management firms ii earlystage loans and partnership interests relating to low income housing developments iii investments in partnerships formed to develop energy that qualifies for tax credits under internal revenue code irc section 29 and iv certain other real estate and other investments these investments are subject to risk of impairment due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk potential litigation failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of gallagher’s invested assets and adversely affect its net worth and profitability 

  

gallagher has historically benefited from section 29 tax credits the disallowance or termination of section 29 tax credits or the loss of all or part of its section 29 tax credits due to phase out of such credits would decrease gallagher’s revenues increase its costs increase its effective tax rate and decrease its income 

  

under current law irc section 29 tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel sold after december 31 2007 and if the law is not extended gallagher’s effective federal income tax rate in 2008 will likely adjust upward to fall within a range of approximately 400 to 420 in addition there have been initiatives from timetotime to consider the early repeal or modification of irc section 29 and the irs is continuing to audit taxpayers claiming irc section 29tax credits related to synthetic fuel facilities with respect to a variety of issues in addition through december 31 2007 irc section 29 has a phaseout provision that is triggered when domestic crude oil reaches certain “phaseout prices” as determined by the irs it is not possible for gallagher to calculate exactly what oil prices will average as determined by the irs for all of calendar year 2006 nor forecast what they will be in 2007 accordingly for purposes of recognizing revenues and expenses related to irc section 29related investments for 2006 gallagher assumed an average 2006 calendar year new york mercantile exchange nymex price of 6612 this average produces an irc section 29 phaseout of approximately 36 and was determined by using actual daily closing prices from january 1 to december 29 2006 for calendar year 2007 gallagher estimates that the commonly reported crude oil price nymex price would need to average approximately 6200 per barrel for calendar 2007 for any phaseout to begin and average approximately 7800 per barrel for calendar 2007 for a complete phaseout the average daily nymex price for 2007 through january 25 was 5423 per barrel 

  

to partially mitigate the financial risk of a phaseout which reduces the value of the tax credits earned and reduces the installment sale gains from gallagher’s irc section 29syncoal investments gallagher entered into arrangements in both 2006 and 2007 with unaffiliated third parties which constitute call spreads on oil futures to create financial hedges that were designed to generate gains to gallagher in the event of certain levels of increased oil prices these hedges are not intended to be “perfect hedges” for accounting purposes but are intended to mitigate a substantial portion of the negative impact to gallagher of increased oil prices any oil price derivative gains are designed to offset a portion of the expenses associated with operating gallagher’s irc section 29syncoal facilities in the event of a phaseout of irc section 29 tax credits which phaseouts are based on oil prices averaging certain levels for calendar years 2006 and 2007 

  

there can be no assurance that future oil prices will be below future phaseout levels should gallagher or its partners anticipate that oil prices may cause a significant phaseout of the irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 some or all of gallagher’s irc section 29 operations could be curtailed resulting in gallagher earning fewer tax credits realizing a higher effective tax rate for federal income tax purposes and triggering indemnification payment obligations under various agreements which gallagher has with its investment partners for further information about the negative effects these contingencies could have on gallagher’s results of operations see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is included in gallagher’s 2006 financial statements under the caption entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and is incorporated herein by reference

the primary source of gallagher’s compensation for its brokerage segment is commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the capacity in which gallagher acts in some cases gallagher is compensated for brokerage or advisory services directly by fees from clients historically gallagher also has received contingent commissions which are based on the estimated profit the underwriting insurance company earns andor the overall volume of business placed by gallagher in a given period of time occasionally gallagher shares commissions with other brokers who have participated with gallagher in placing insurance or servicing insureds gbs receives a fee for acting in the capacity of advisor and administrator with respect to employee benefit programs and receives commissions in connection with the placement of insurance under such programs as previously reported on may 18 2005 gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates except for gallagher bassett services inc entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance the avc with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois collectively the il state agencies to resolve all of the issues related to certain investigations conducted by the il state agencies involving contingent commission arrangements as stipulated in the avc on january 12 2006 gallagher paid 269 million into a fund to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients in addition under the avc gallagher agreed to implement to the extent not previously undertaken certain business changes including agreeing not to accept usdomiciled retail contingent compensation as defined in the avc on october 26 2004 gallagher announced that it would not enter into any new volumebased or profitbased contingent commissions agreements as a retail broker effective january 1 2005 however as allowed under the avc gallagher has continued to accept contingent compensation from nonretail business including business generated by wholesalers managing general agents and managing general underwriters in addition the avc allows gallagher to collect retail contingent compensation related to contracts in place at entities acquired up to one year from the acquisition date see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the material terms of the avc accordingly gallagher has begun to experience reduced contingent commission revenue and it is expected that future contingent commission revenues will continue to be substantially reduced the reduction in retail contingent commissions as discussed above could continue to have a substantial negative impact on gallagher’s pretax earnings beginning in 2006

markets and marketing 

  

a large portion of the commission and fee business of gallagher is derived from all types of business institutions notforprofit organizations associations and municipal and other governmental entities gallagher’s clients include us and multinational corporations engaged in a broad range of commercial and industrial businesses gallagher also places insurance for individuals gallagher services its clients through its network of more than 250 sales and service offices in the us and six countries abroad no material part of gallagher’s business is dependent upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a materially adverse effect on gallagher in 2005 the largest single customer represented less than 1 of total revenues and the ten largest customers represented no more than 6 of total revenues 

  

gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured risk management and brokerage services including the placement of insurance and reinsurance is one of its major strengths gallagher also believes that its risk management business enhances and attracts insurance brokerage business due to the nature and strength of business relationships that it forms with clients when providing a variety of risk management services on an ongoing basis 

  

gallagher requires its employees serving in a sales or marketing capacity including all executive officers of gallagher to enter into agreements with gallagher restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of clients and prospects of gallagher upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control of gallagher as defined therein 

  

competition 

  

according to business insurance magazine july 18 2005 edition gallagher is the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide third largest in the us in terms of total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in every area of its business gallagher competes with three firms that are as large or significantly larger than gallagher in global risk management and brokerage markets in addition there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office that is as large or larger than the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients 

  

gallagher is also in competition with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and hence indirectly compete with the business of gallagher 

  

regulation 

  

in every state and foreign jurisdiction in which gallagher does business gallagher andor an employee is required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in order for gallagher to conduct business in addition to licensing requirements applicable to gallagher most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance service activities be personally licensed 

  

gallagher’s insurance brokerage and risk management operations depend on its continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which it operates licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in all jurisdictions the applicable licensing laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad and general discretion as to the granting renewing and revoking of licenses and approvals 

  

as previously discussed on may 18 2005 gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates except for gallagher bassett services inc entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance the avc with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois collectively the il state agencies to resolve all of the issues related to investigations conducted by the il state agencies under the avc gallagher agreed to implement to the extent not previously undertaken certain business changes including agreeing not to accept usdomiciled retail contingent compensation as defined in the avc see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2005 financial statements for a discussion of the material terms of the avc 

  

business combinations 

  

in 2005 gallagher acquired the net assets of ten insurance brokerage firms nine asset purchases and one stock purchase in exchange for its common stock andor cash and accounted for them as business combinations see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2005 financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference for a summary of the 2005 acquisitions the amount and nature of the consideration paid and the dates of acquisition 

  

since december 31 2005 gallagher has completed one acquisition which is as follows 

  

effective on january 1 2006 gallagher acquired substantially all of the net assets of benefit management group inc a corporation engaged in the benefits insurance business in exchange for 132000 shares of gallagher’s common stock cash of 60 million and a contingent earnout obligation of 85 million that if any is earned will be paid in cash or stock at gallagher’s election 

  

gallagher believes that the net effect of these acquisitions has been and will be to expand the volume of general services rendered by gallagher and the geographical areas in which gallagher renders such services and not to change substantially the nature of the services performed by gallagher 

  

gallagher is considering and intends to consider from timetotime additional acquisitions and divestitures on terms that it deems advantageous gallagher at this time is engaged in preliminary discussions with a number of candidates for possible future acquisitions no assurances can be given that any additional acquisitions or divestitures will be consummated or if consummated will be advantageous to gallagher

 item 1a risk factors 

  

volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine gallagher’s profitability 

  

gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for brokerage and risk management services gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based moreover insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for example for an extended period of years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market which in turn put downward pressure on gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas after this period of time the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing this trend was accentuated by the events of september 11 th  following which insurance coverage in many lines became less available and premium rates increased in some cases dramatically more recently during 2004 and 2005 the market softened again in many lines and in many geographic areas however the abnormally high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in those years has hardened the market in certain geographic areas and business lines because of these market fluctuations for insurance products which gallagher cannot predict or control its brokerage revenues and profitability may be volatile 

  

in addition there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including among other things greater levels of selfinsurance captives rentacaptives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance while gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain fee revenue for such services there can be no assurance that gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as what is realized from its traditional brokerage activities 

  

gallagher’s results may be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully implement a new business compensation model 

  

in october 2004 gallagher announced that effective january 1 2005 it would not enter into any new volumebased or profitbased contingent commissions agreements as a retail broker in connection with the elimination of contingent commissions gallagher established a new business compensation model and commission structure this business compensation model and commission structure remains in its early stages and there can be no assurance that it will generate incremental commission revenues equivalent to those previously received from contingent commissions the inability to generate adequate revenues from gallagher’s new business compensation model and commission structure may significantly undermine gallagher’s operating results and profitability 

  

gallagher is subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent compensation other industry practices and certain conduct which if determined unfavorably to gallagher could adversely affect its financial strength and results of operations 

  

private parties have filed civil litigation against gallagher under a variety of legal theories relating among other things to broker compensation practices gallagher is named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit pending in the circuit court of cook county illinois which challenges the propriety of alleged “undisclosed contingent commissions” paid pursuant to certain compensation arrangements between gallagher and various insurance carriers additionally gallagher is one of a number of insurance brokerage and insurance company defendants in a multidistrict litigation proceeding before the us district court for the district of new jersey and is party to various other litigation matters additionally the insurance industry in general and gallagher individually continue to be the subjects of a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies including state attorneys general and the departments of insurance for various states with respect to contingent commission arrangements on may 18 2005 gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates except for gallagher bassett services inc entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance the avc with the attorney general of the state of illinois and the director of insurance of the state of illinois collectively the il state agencies to resolve all of the issues related to investigations conducted by the il state agencies pursuant to which it paid 269 million into a fund to be distributed to eligible retail customers by march 31 2006 and agreed to undertake certain business changes for a more detailed discussion of these matters refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2005 financial statements 

  

the ultimate outcome of the matters referred to above and similar matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on gallagher gallagher’s future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition even if gallagher does not experience significant monetary costs there has been and may continue to be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to gallagher or to the insurance brokerage industry in general that may adversely affect gallagher’s business 

  

gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses 

  

the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in one or more areas of its business gallagher competes with three firms that are as large or significantly larger than gallagher in global risk management and brokerage markets in addition there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have in that region or locality an office that is as large or larger than the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect gallagher’s business 

  

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect gallagher these developments include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for gallagher’s products and services to change which could in turn could adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

gallagher faces a variety of risks from its gallagher bassett services operations which are distinct from those it faces in its brokerage operations 

  

gallagher’s risk management segment which accounted for approximately 25 of gallagher’s total 2005 revenues operates primarily through its subsidiary gallagher bassett services gb gb is a third party administrator and risk consultant that provides a range of risk management services including claims management risk control consulting services information management and property appraisals while gb’s business has little exposure to the hard and soft market cycles described above to which gallagher’s brokerage business is exposed gb faces a variety of other risks which are unique to its operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

gallagher’s business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

  

gallagher may be subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because gallagher often assists clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against gallagher may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs 

  

gallagher purchases insurance to provide protection from errors and omissions claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business subject to selfinsured deductibles and limits as of december 31 2005 the amount of gallagher’s deductible and limit for claims were 50 million and 1550 million respectively gallagher’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future its insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is a general increase in the number or amounts of claims to which gallagher is exposed gallagher’s future ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles and limits it desires may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or gallagher’s own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm gallagher’s reputation or divert management resources away from operating its business 

  

gallagher historically has engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions 

  

in the past several years gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in gallagher achieving slower growth various factors may affect gallagher’s ability to attract acquisition targets including gallagher’s inability to continue certain contingent commission compensation structures particularly in light of the fact that certain other companies in the insurance brokerage industry are not limited in this manner moreover even if gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner which allows gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions thereby negatively affecting gallagher’s results of operations or leading to unanticipated contingent liabilities and losses 

  

gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide if gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects gallagher’s operations gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable 

  

many of gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary action that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of gallagher’s authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from timetotime require operational changes which could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder gallagher’s ability to operate its business 

  

gallagher’s future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

  

gallagher believes that its future success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including its senior management brokers and other key personnel the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers and gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past the loss of any of its senior managers brokers or other key personnel or its inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition 

  

gallagher has significant nonus operations which expose it to certain additional risks including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk 

  

a significant portion of gallagher’s operations is conducted outside the us accordingly gallagher is subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries operating in these countries may present risks that are different from or greater than risks to gallagher of doing comparable business in the us 

  

some of gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although gallagher implemented a foreign currency hedging strategy in 2005 such risks cannot be eliminated entirely and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect gallagher’s results of operations 

  

gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the us and more established countries gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations for example gallagher uses a thirdparty service provider located in india for certain back office services to date the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected gallagher’s infrastructure in india however such factors could potentially affect gallagher’s infrastructure or ability to utilize thirdparty providers in the future should gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted gallagher’s business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

gallagher is exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by its financial services business 

  

gallagher’s financial services business holds a variety of investments including i an interest in a holding company that holds interests in private investment management firms ii earlystage loans partnership interests relating to low income housing developments and an ownership interest in a low income housing developer and syndicator iii investments in partnerships formed to develop energy that qualifies for tax credits under internal revenue code irc section 29 and iv certain other real estate and other investments these investments are subject to risk of impairment due to a variety of causes including general overall economic conditions the effects of changes in interest rates various regulatory issues credit risk failure to monetize in an effective andor costefficient manner and poor operating results any of these consequences may diminish the value of gallagher’s invested assets and adversely affect its net worth and profitability 

  

gallagher has historically benefited from section 29 tax credits the disallowance or termination of section 29 tax credits or the loss of all or part of its section 29 tax credits due to phase out of such credits would decrease gallagher’s revenues increase its costs increase its effective tax rate and decrease its income 

  

under current law irc section 29 tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel sold after december 31 2007 and if the law is not extended gallagher’s effective federal income tax rate in 2008 will likely adjust upward to fall within a range of approximately 350 to 420 in addition there have been initiatives from timetotime to consider the early repeal or modification of irc section 29 and the irs is continuing to audit taxpayers claiming syncoal credits with respect to a variety of issues in addition through december 31 2007 irc section 29 has a phaseout provision that is triggered when domestic crude oil reaches certain “phaseout prices” as determined by the irs for calendar year 2006 gallagher estimates that the commonly reported crude oil price nymex price would need to average approximately 6000 per barrel for calendar 2006 for any phaseout to begin and average approximately 7400 per barrel for calendar 2006 for a complete phaseout the average daily nymex price for 2006 through january 30 was 6541 per barrel 

  

there can be no assurance that future oil prices will be below future phaseout levels should gallagher or its partners anticipate that oil prices may reach the range of phaseout prices in 2006 or in 2007 some or all of gallagher’s irc section 29 operations could be curtailed resulting in gallagher losing tax credits realizing a higher effective tax rate for federal income tax purposes and triggering indemnification payment obligations under various agreements which gallagher has with its investment partners for further information about the negative effects these contingencies could have on gallagher’s results of operations see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is included in gallagher’s 2005 financial statements under the caption entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and is incorporated herein by reference

in connection with its risk management services gb provides “selfinsurance” programs for large institutions risk sharing pools and associations and large commercial and industrial customers selfinsurance as administered by gb is a program in which the client assumes a manageable portion of its insurance risks usually although not always placing the less predictable and larger loss exposures with an insurance carrier that specializes in these less predictable exposures

investments were determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired resulting in a 257 million pretax charge in first quarter 2003 in addition effective july 1 2003 gallagher early adopted fasb interpretation no 46 fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which required gallagher to consolidate one partiallyowned entity that was determined to be a variable interest entity vie and previously not consolidated because it was not controlled by gallagher through a majority voting interest the adoption of fin 46 did not result in any additional debt on gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet nor did it have any impact on its 2003 consolidated net earnings or december 31 2003 stockholders’ equity during third quarter 2004 gallagher sold a portion of its interest in this investment which eliminated the requirement to consolidate the investment under the fin 46 rules this investment is now accounted for using equity method accounting see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2004 financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference for a summary of gallagher’s investments

gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured risk management and brokerage services including the placement of insurance and reinsurance is one of its major strengths gallagher also believes that its risk management business enhances and attracts insurance brokerage business due to the nature and strength of business relationships that it forms with clients when providing a variety of risk management services on an ongoing basis

competition 

  

according to business insurance magazine july 19 2004 edition gallagher is the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide third largest in the united states in terms of total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in every area of its business three competing firms are significantly larger two of which have several times the commission andor fee revenues of gallagher there are firms in a particular region or locality that are as large or larger than the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients 

  

gallagher is also in competition with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and hence indirectly compete with the business of gallagher to date such direct writing and government benefits have had in the opinion of gallagher relatively little effect on its business and operations but gallagher can make no prediction as to their effect in the future

in connection with its risk management services gb provides “selfinsurance” programs for large institutions risk sharing pools and associations and large commercial and industrial customers selfinsurance as administered by gb is a program in which the client assumes a manageable portion of its insurance risks usually although not always placing the less predictable and larger loss exposures with an insurance carrier that specializes in these less predictable exposures

note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2003 financial statements on pages 26 to 32 which are incorporated herein by reference for a summary of gallagher’s investments 

  

gallagher’s overall nonfiduciary investment strategy going forward will be primarily focused on tax advantaged investments and real estate gallagher uses the limited partnership or limited liability company forms of legal ownership to fund many of its investments in order to obtain favorable tax treatment with respect to gains losses and distributions while limiting its liability based on the ownership structure of these investments management believes that gallagher’s exposure to losses related to these investments is limited to the combination of its net carrying value letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments in the event that certain of these limited partnerships or limited liability companies were to default on their debt obligations and gallagher’s net carrying value became impaired the amount to be writtenoff could have a material effect on gallagher’s consolidated financial position or operating results in some cases gallagher may be at risk for tax credits taken in previous years which may also be material to its operations see note 3 pages 26 to 32 and note 16 pages 43 to 47 to the consolidated financial statements of gallagher’s 2003 financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference for a summary of outstanding letters of credit financial guarantees and funding commitments and note 7 on page 36 for a summary of outstanding debt and contingent commitments in addition see note 3 pages 26 to 32 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of gallagher’s tax credit exposure

markets and marketing 

  

a large portion of the commission and fee business of gallagher is derived from all types of business institutions notforprofit organizations associations and municipal and other governmental entities gallagher’s clients include united states and multinational corporations engaged in a broad range of commercial and industrial businesses gallagher also places insurance for individuals gallagher services its clients through its network of more than 250 sales and service offices in the united states and eight countries abroad no material part of gallagher’s business is dependent upon a single customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a materially adverse effect on gallagher in 2003 the largest single customer represented less than 2 of total revenues 

  

gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured risk management and brokerage services including the placement of insurance and reinsurance is one of its major strengths gallagher also believes that its risk management business enhances and attracts insurance brokerage business due to the nature and strength of business relationships that it forms with clients when providing a variety of risk management services on an ongoing basis 

  

gallagher requires its employees serving in a sales or marketing capacity including all executive officers of gallagher to enter into agreements with gallagher restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of clients and prospects of gallagher upon their termination of employment the confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control of gallagher as defined therein 

  

competition 

  

according to business insurance magazine gallagher is the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide third largest in the united states in terms of total revenues the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with gallagher in every area of its business three competing firms are significantly larger and have several times the commission andor fee revenues of gallagher there are firms in a particular region or locality that are as large or larger than the particular local office of gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients 

  

gallagher is also in competition with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and hence indirectly compete with the business of gallagher to date such direct writing and government benefits have had in the opinion of gallagher relatively little effect on its business and operations but gallagher can make no prediction as to their effect in the future 

  

regulation 

  

in every state and foreign jurisdiction in which gallagher does business gallagher or an employee is required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in order for gallagher to conduct business in addition to licensing requirements applicable to gallagher most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance service activities be personally licensed 

  

gallagher’s insurance brokerage and risk management operations depend on its continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which it operates licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in all jurisdictions the applicable licensing laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad and general discretion as to the granting renewing and revoking of licenses and approvals

gallagher believes that the net effect of these acquisitions has been and will be to expand the volume of general services rendered by gallagher and the geographical areas in which gallagher renders such services and not to change substantially the nature of the services performed by gallagher 

  

gallagher is considering and intends to consider from time to time additional acquisitions and divestitures on terms that it deems advantageous gallagher at this time is engaged in preliminary discussions with a number of candidates for possible future acquisitions and has received signed nonbinding letters of intent from six acquisition candidates no assurances can be given that any additional acquisitions or divestitures will be consummated or if consummated will be advantageous to gallagher

     during 2002 and 2001 gallaghers total revenues and expenses increased
sequentially from quartertoquarter within the calendar years except for the
second quarter of 2001 and the third quarter of 2002 the latter of which was
negatively impacted by 289 million of investment writedowns however
commission and fee revenues and the related expenses can vary from
quartertoquarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates that
traditionally are heaviest in the third and fourth quarters on the other hand
salaries and employee benefits rent depreciation and amortization expenses
tend to be more uniform throughout the year in addition the timing of
acquisitions accounted for as purchases will also impact the trends in
gallaghers quarterly operating results see note 17 to the consolidated

information related to gallaghers foreign operations including earnings before

markets and marketing

     a large portion of the commission and fee business of gallagher is derived
from all types of business institutions notforprofit organizations
associations and municipal and other governmental entities gallaghers clients
include united states and multinational corporations engaged in a broad range
of commercial and industrial businesses gallagher also places insurance for
individuals although this portion of the business is not material to
gallaghers operations gallagher services its clients through its network of
more than 250 sales and service offices in the united states and six countries
abroad no material part of gallaghers business is dependent upon a single
customer or on a few customers the loss of any one customer would not have a

represented less than 2 of total revenues


                                       6

page

     gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured
risk management and brokerage services including the placement of insurance and
reinsurance is one of its major strengths gallagher also believes that its
risk management business enhances and attracts insurance brokerage business due
to the nature and strength of business relationships that it forms with clients
when providing a variety of risk management services on an ongoing basis


     gallagher requires its employees serving in a sales or marketing capacity
including all executive officers of gallagher to enter into agreements with
gallagher restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of
clients and prospects of gallagher upon their termination of employment the
confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in
the event of a hostile change in control of gallagher as defined therein

competition

     gallagher believes it is the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide
third largest in the united states in terms of total revenues the insurance
brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many
insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals throughout
the world who actively compete with gallagher in every area of its business two
competing firms are significantly larger and have several times the commission
andor fee revenues of gallagher there are firms in a particular region or
locality that are as large or larger than the particular local office of
gallagher gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its
competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of
the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients


     gallagher is also in competition with certain insurance companies that
write insurance directly for their customers government benefits relating to
health disability and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance
and hence indirectly compete with the business of gallagher to date such
direct writing and government benefits have had in the opinion of gallagher
relatively little effect on its business and operations but gallagher can make
no prediction as to their effect in the future


regulation

     in every state and foreign jurisdiction in which gallagher does business
gallagher or an employee is required to be licensed or receive regulatory
approval in order for gallagher to conduct business in addition to licensing
requirements applicable to gallagher most jurisdictions require that
individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance service activities be
personally licensed


     gallaghers insurance brokerage and risk management operations depend on
its continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which
it operates licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction in all jurisdictions the applicable licensing laws and
regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory
authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad and
general discretion as to the granting renewing and revoking of licenses and
approvals
