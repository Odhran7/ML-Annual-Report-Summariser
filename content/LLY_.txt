marketing and distribution 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations 

us 

we promote our major products in the us through sales representatives who engage with physicians and other health care professionals we also educate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways including promoting in online health care channels distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibiting at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites and other media channels with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations group purchasing organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

in the us most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies physicians and other health care professionals and hospitals in 2021 2020 and 2019 three wholesale distributors in the us—mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of our consolidated revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years 

outside the us 

outside the us we promote our products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and other health care channels while the products we market vary from country to country diabetes products constitute the largest single group of our consolidated revenue distribution patterns for our products also vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through thirdparty distributors some of which we have engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements 

marketing collaborations 

certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for example we and boehringer ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products including trajenta jentadueto ®  jardiance glyxambi ®  synjardy ®  trijardy ® xr and basaglar 

for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

competition 

our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets 

important competitive factors include effectiveness safety and ease of use formulary placement price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes modalities and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded biosimilar or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors when competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages including by developing new modalities our products become subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends on discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will be or will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and europe the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product as a result generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product which can cause us to lose a significant portion of the products revenue in a very short period of time 

further public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch 

biosimilars 

a number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinicalstage pipeline are biologics in the us the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations competition for lillys biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic approval by the fda ultimately depends on many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency 

globally most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as followons to innovatordeveloped biologics including the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 the bpcia in the us a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the bpcia and in europe the patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market however in the us the product exclusivity period under the bpcia could be affected by recent government proposals and litigation see  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights in addition the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing in the us currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable by the fda will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the fda has begun to issue interchangeable designations for biosimilar products 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro that competes with our product humalog on the other hand in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar an insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a followon biologic in the us and as a biosimilar in europe and japan however in march 2020 the fda began regulating all of our insulin products as biologics rather than drugs based on fda draft guidance this change may lessen the amount of data required for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at us pharmacies for example in june 2020 the fda approved a new drug application nda for semglee a followon insulin glargine product that competes with basaglar in the us and in july 2021 semglee received additional fda approval as a biosimilar that is interchangeable to its reference insulin glargine product the fdas interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and therefore the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty 

us private sector dynamics 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals health plans managed care organizations pharmacy benefit managers wholesalers and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance private thirdparty insurers as well as governments typically maintain formularies that specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion 

formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in pricing and usage negotiation and compete fiercely for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates as payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and pricing valuebased agreements where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcomes are another tool that may become increasingly prevalent price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable we expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations in addition to formulary placement changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer costsharing through high deductible plans and higher coinsurance or copays for additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products see  regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access  us 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us major european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the research and development section below in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

• patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all us patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the united states patent and trademark office uspto 

• patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to us patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the fda to make up for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the fda review process a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the fda to review an application there is a fiveyear cap on any restoration and no patents expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from fda approval some countries outside the us similarly offer forms of patent term restoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a regulatory agency for example supplementary protection certificates are available to extend the life of a european patent up to an additional five years subject to a 15year cap from european medicines agency ema approval also in japan south korea and australia patent terms can be extended up to five years depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors 

loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals especially for nonbiologic products typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product however in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic biosimilar or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on manufacturing processes methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

• regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator companys regulatory submission data for the drug the base period of data package protection depends on the country for example the period is generally five years in the us 12 years for new biologics as described below effectively 10 years in europe and eight years in japan the period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent 

• under the bpcia the fda has the authority to approve biosimilars a competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the fda will consider on a casebycase basis under the data protection provisions of this law the fda cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic subject to certain conditions 

• in the us the fda has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period if granted this pediatric exclusivity provides an additional six months of exclusivity which is added to the term of data protection and for products other than biologics to the term of any relevant patents to the extent these protections have not already expired while the term of the pediatric exclusivity attaches to the term of any relevant patent pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity—ie a bar to generic or biosimilar approval not a patent right 

• under the us orphan drug law a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive orphan designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200000 people in the us or affecting more than 200000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through us sales among other benefits orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity meaning that the fda cannot with limited exceptions approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the sevenyear period unlike pediatric exclusivity the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents 

outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of flexibilities allowed under the agreement thus some types of patents such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules are not available in certain developing countries further many developing countries and some developed countries do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trips 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes uses and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations in addition to the patents and data protection identified below we may hold patents on manufacturing processes formulations devices or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below for approved products dates include where applicable pending or granted patent term extensions 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our major or recently launched patentprotected marketed products are as follows 

• alimta is protected by pediatric exclusivity 2022 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies for information regarding our settlement agreement with eagle pharmaceuticals inc and its impact on our exclusivity for alimta

• verzenio is protected by a compound patent 2033 and data protection 2028 in major european countries and by a compound patent 2034 and data protection 2026 in japan 

the following product candidates are currently under regulatory review upon approval we expect relevant compound patent and data protections to apply 

• we have commenced a rolling submission in the us for donanemab for the treatment of alzheimers disease 

• we have commenced a rolling submission in the us for pirtobrutinib loxo305 for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma 

• reyvow has been submitted for regulatory review in certain major european countries for the acute treatment of migraine 

• tirzepatide has been submitted for regulatory review in the us in japan and in certain major european countries as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes 

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks consisting of our product names logos and unique product appearances eg the appearance of our trulicity autoinjector which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product 

patent licenses and collaborations 

most of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements for information on our license and collaboration agreements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biologics which are discussed below in more detail when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy establishing pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after certain of the innovators patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more or all of the patents listed in the innovators nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a paragraph iv certification if the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic companys application for a 30month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown willingness to launch at risk ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge 

under the bpcia the fda cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved however the bpcia does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovators patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic 

the patent litigation scheme under the bpcia and the bpcia itself is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as well as courts courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the bpcia patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration further in the us the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators market exclusivity see also  competition  biosimilars in addition there is a procedure in us patent law known as inter partes review ipr which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued us patent for validity iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the ipr process in attempts to invalidate our patents the use of ipr proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the bpcia or hatchwaxman act is currently a topic of debate among legislators we expect additional changes to the patent trial and appeal board ptab including potentially to the policy to discretionarily deny an otherwise meritorious petition for ipr in light of a concurrent district court proceeding see risk factors—risks related to our business—our longterm success depends on intellectual property protection if our intellectual property rights are invalidated circumvented or weakened our business will be adversely affected 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us

government regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies 

regulation of products 

the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers the environment occupational health and safety data privacy and other matters evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations including with respect to current good manufacturing practices cgmp quality assurance and similar regulations compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance to our business is regulation by the fda in the us pursuant to laws and regulations that include the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing promotion advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products 

following approval our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling import export storage recordkeeping advertising promotion and safety reporting we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell the fda may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market the fda strictly regulates marketing labeling advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under its cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the ema in europe the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan and the national medical products administration in china specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country regulatory requirements and approval processes outside the us may differ from those in the us and may involve additional costs uncertainties and risks 

we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing product development and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements we become subject to potential government investigations regulatory and legal actions product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages import bans or denials of import certifications delays or denials in new product approvals and reputational harm any of which would adversely affect our business certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us including through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals any determination by the fda or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations that may affect our research development or production efforts 

emergency use authorizations 

the secretary of health and human services may authorize unapproved medical products to be manufactured marketed and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government after an emergency has been announced the secretary of health and human services may authorize euas for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing treating or preventing serious or lifethreatening diseases when there are no adequate approved and available alternatives an eua is subject to additional conditions and restrictions such as the obligation to provide fact sheets for healthcare providers administering the product and those to whom it is administered adverse event monitoring and reporting and recordkeeping and reporting requirements by product manufacturers the fda may also establish additional discretionary conditions of authorization that the fda deems necessary or appropriate to protect the public health including conditions related to product distribution product administration and data collection and analysis concerning the safety and effectiveness of the product in issuing an eua the fda considers the totality of available scientific evidence regarding quality safety and efficacy including the known and potential risks of such products and the adequacy and availability of approved alternatives among other factors an eua is not a substitute for obtaining fda approval licensure or clearance for use of a product an eua terminates when the emergency determination underlying the eua terminates and euas can be revoked under other circumstances the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict 

outside the us the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that differ from those in the us 

the covid19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the us on the basis of such determination the secretary of health and human services declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the covid19 pandemic the fda has granted euas for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together baricitinib and bebtelovimab and similar actions have been taken by other regulators in certain jurisdictions outside the us however the fda has revised and may in the future revise any eua for our covid19 antibodies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy for example in january 2022 the fda revised the eua for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to limit their use to only when the patient is likely to have been infected with or exposed to a variant that is susceptible to this combination treatment 

other laws and regulations 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to various other us federal and state laws as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations including the federal antikickback statute the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years state federal and foreign governments agencies and other regulatory bodies have increased their oversight enforcement activities and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies which has resulted in intensified scrutiny corporate criminal sanctions and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry 

in december 2020 the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services and the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms issued final rules expanding and modifying existing and adding new regulatory safe harbors and exceptions respectively under the antikickback statute and the ethics in patient referrals act we are currently evaluating the impact if any these regulatory amendments will have upon becoming effective on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position which is uncertain at this time 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

we are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations that may affect our research development or production efforts 

regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

us 

there continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and measures to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals are being considered at various levels of state and federal government in addition us government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products additionally there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products restrictive or unfavorable pricing coverage or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments regulatory agencies or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results for example in january 2022 the cms proposed a national coverage determination ncd decision memorandum stating that the proposed ncd would cover fda approved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for the treatment of alzheimers disease for people with medicare only if they are enrolled in qualifying clinical trials the alzheimer’s monoclonal antibody ncd if finalized in its current form the proposed alzheimer’s monoclonal antibody ncd would result in reduced coverage for and negatively impact our product candidate donanemab and may negatively impact our business and financial results the regulatory priorities of the current us presidential administration could further intensify these efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs including state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of health care facilities intended to serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average sales price plus 43 percent formula additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs since 2019 the bipartisan budget act has required manufacturers of brandname drugs biologics and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the doughnut hole the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare may be impacted by the 2020 regulatory amendments to the antikickback statutes discount safe harbor which have currently been stayed until at least january 1 2026 pending legislation could repeal the amendments to the discount safe harbor accordingly their impact on our business is uncertain at this time 

outside the us 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes in addition thirdparty organizations including professional associations academic institutions and nonprofit entities associated with payers are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and costbenefit analyses on medicines the impact of which are uncertain at this time 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution we may experience additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the covid19 pandemic on governmentfunded healthcare systems around the world 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer developments however in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products 

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access for additional information regarding recent legislative administrative and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2021 we employed approximately 8100 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel 

our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of diabetes immunology neuroscience and oncology during the past two years we have also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for covid19 in addition to discovering and developing new medicines we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines we also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including among others licensing arrangements codevelopment agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures acquisitions and equity investments 

pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

• discovery phase 

in the discovery phase scientists identify design and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans the discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low 

• early development phase 

early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals as necessary in general the first human tests often referred to as phase i are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range subsequently larger populations of patients are studied phase ii to identify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the candidates that enter the early development phase approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase the early development phase varies but can take several years to complete 

• late development phase 

late phase development projects typically phase iii have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies as a result these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease these studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies placebo or both phase iii studies are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval the duration of phase iii testing varies by disease and may take two to four years 

• submission phase 

once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on the disease state the strength and complexity of available data the degree of unmet need and the time required for the regulatory agencyies to evaluate the submission which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new medicines and new treatment indications in all stages of development we currently have approximately 45 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product however various developments from time to time lead to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources or in some cases implement alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the us including puerto rico and ireland finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that is intended to allow us to meet substantially all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems inventory management and backup sites 

however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly developments such as unplanned plant shutdowns manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities increases in demand on a supplier or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products from time to time lead to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products or product shortages further global transportation and logistics challenges as well as tight labor markets have caused and in the future may cause delays in andor increase costs related to distribution of our medicines the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity procurement activity and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements for more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties disruptions and shortages in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products see risk factors  risks related to our business  manufacturing and supply chain difficulties disruptions or shortages could lead to product supply problems 

in addition the strain on global transportation logistics and labor markets caused by the covid19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials have had and may continue to have a number of impacts on our business including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and disruptions in the supply of our medicines for more information see item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business  the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations we are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future and item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  covid19 pandemic 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination thereof additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at thirdparty suppliers 

executive officers of the company

employee development 

we believe talent begins with the hiring process we therefore require hiring managers to consider a diverse pool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions we believe that hiring in this way helps ensure that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers 

we offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry we also strive to cultivate a culture that promotes ongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences helping them build rewarding careers we have introduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings many training courses are designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs across lilly we are working to design learning experiences to be more inclusive and effective in addition we have implemented tools and resources and improved our talent programs and processes to provide broad access to information and transparency regarding career development and advancement at lilly 

in early 2022 we launched discover  a 12month new employee onboarding program with multiple touchpoints designed to foster integration into the lilly culture to accelerate learning in their new roles and to create connections to further a sense of belonging at lilly discover was shaped in part by external benchmarking feedback from employees and learnings from onboarding remotely during the covid19 pandemic 

employee resource groups ergs are another important component of developing talent at lilly we currently have 11 ergs representing groups including women mgms lgbtq individuals veterans and people with disabilities ergs offer our diverse workforce opportunities to build relationships engage with senior leaders advance our caring community and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our business 

we have continued our efforts to create an inclusive workplace with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and share their ideas at work our make it safe to thrive education and awareness program is designed to help employees and leaders understand how individual psychological safety can be created and enhanced and includes live and online training and a monthly video series 

lilly is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and respect in the workplace—an environment free of discrimination harassment or retaliation of any kind in 2022 as part of our annual review of the red book lillys comprehensive code of business conduct applicable to our board and all employees worldwide and related policies and procedures we revised the global conduct in the workplace procedure to continue to help ensure that we maintain a respectful safe inclusive and professional workplace 

employee health and safety 

we strive to foster a healthy vibrant work environment which includes keeping our employees safe we seek to create a companywide culture where bestinclass safety practices are consistently followed to do this we assess and continuously attempt to improve our companywide safety performance to promote the wellbeing of employees and to help safeguard communities where we operate as the covid19 pandemic has evolved we have taken various measures to protect and support the health and safety of our employees globally including instituting travel restrictions and workfromhome arrangements offering onsite testing and vaccination options where possible and instituting safety precautions such as masking social distancing and enhanced cleaning practices to support employee wellbeing in the us we also enhanced local benefits related to health care childcare and time off we believe this holistic approach and dedication to safety helps us be our best as we deliver on our company purpose to improve lives around the world

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks certain of these risks could also adversely affect the companys reputation additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business and reputation 

risks related to our business 

• the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations we are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future 

the covid19 pandemic continues to burden healthcare systems worldwide the focus of resources on covid19 widespread protective measures implemented to control the spread of covid19 and the resulting strain on global transportation manufacturing and labor markets have negatively impacted development manufacturing supply distribution and sales of our medicines 

although inperson interactions with healthcare professionals have largely resumed we continue to see a lack of normal access and fewer inperson interactions by patients and our employees with healthcare professionals as the covid19 pandemic continues to develop we may decide to halt such inperson interactions in the future and in those cases expect to resume such interactions as it is safe to do so and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirements 

the strain on global transportation logistics and labor markets caused by the covid19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials resulting in changed buying patterns and constrained supply have had and may continue to have a number of impacts on our business including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and disruptions and shortages in the supply of our medicines these factors may negatively affect our results of operations 

we also face risks and uncertainties related to our covid19 therapies including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices quality assurance and similar regulations restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies and risks related to handling return andor refund of product after delivery by us in addition expedited authorization processes have allowed restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety and efficacy data and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our covid19 therapies the availability of superior or competitive therapies including therapies that can be administered more easily or preventative measures such as vaccines coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for our covid19 therapies we also expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus have in some cases impacted the effectiveness of our covid19 therapies and may further render our therapies more or less effective or ineffective furthermore the fda has revised and may in the future revise any eua for our covid19 therapies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our therapies have varying degrees of efficacy these and other risks related to covid19 could affect other aspects of our business or intensify other risks inherent in our business including potentially resulting in delays or denials in the approval or launch of other products or indications 

it remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on us the degree to which the covid19 pandemic continues to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control including but not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic the actions taken to reduce its transmission including widespread availability and efficacy of vaccines the introduction and spread of new variants of the coronavirus that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines the continuation of existing or implementation of new government restrictions and the speed with which and extent to which more stable economic and operating conditions resume should the covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic epidemic or similar public health threat and any associated supply chain disruption labor 

market impact recession or depression continue for a prolonged period these risks could be exacerbated causing further impact on our business and operations in the future 

• pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain we may not succeed in developing licensing or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development the introduction of new products and business development activities to enhance our product pipeline 

there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses label changes changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful 

we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products both through our internal efforts and our business development activities sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

we engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline including licensing arrangements codevelopment agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures acquisitions and equity investments there are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions increased focus on business combinations in our industry including by the federal trade commission and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities in addition failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses products or assets we acquire including related technology commercial operations compliance programs manufacturing distribution and general business operations and procedures may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges we also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to developments outside our control including unsuccessful clinical trials issues related to the quality integrity or broad applicability of data regulatory impediments and commercialization challenges accordingly business development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner if at all may not result in successful commercialization of any product and may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny 

see item 1 business  research and development  phases of new drug development and item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline for more details about our current product pipeline 

• we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings we have lost or soon will lose effective intellectual property protection for a number of our products which has resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe declines in revenues 

a number of our products including alimta and forteo have recently lost or soon will lose significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as in key jurisdictions outside the us we have faced and remain exposed to generic competition following the loss of such intellectual property protection in particular we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta in the us following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiologic products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues especially in the us for biologics such as humalog humulin erbitux cyramza trulicity taltz and emgality loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to many factors including development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions generic pharmaceutical companies could also introduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters and item 1 business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

• our longterm success depends on intellectual property protection if our intellectual property rights are invalidated circumvented or weakened our business will be adversely affected 

our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new medicines without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time depending on local laws and regulations changes to such laws and regulations could reduce protections for our innovative products in the us in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the bpcia which applies to biologic products the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering pharmaceutical products as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products including biologics will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld in addition a separate ipr process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the uspto without the protections of the bpcia or hatchwaxman act the use of ipr proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the bpcia or hatchwaxman act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use ipr proceedings as an alternative to hatchwaxman act or bpcia litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain however if our patents are challenged through this expedited review process even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent our win provides limited precedential value at the ptab and no precedential value in federal district court meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales in addition intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the us is weak and we face additional risks to our intellectual property rights including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch see item 1 business

• we and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and lowercost generic and biosimilar manufacturers and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies and in many cases our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs 

regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts particularly for biosimilars recent health authority guidelines and legislative proposals could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars in the us the fda has begun issuing interchangeability designations for biosimilar products which could – subject to state law requirements – enable pharmacies to substitute biosimilars for innovator biological products given the importance of biologic products to our clinicalstage pipeline such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business see item 1 business  competition and business  research and development for more details 

in addition we rely on our ability to attract engage and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel in order to compete effectively to continue to commercialize our products and advance the research development and commercialization of additional modalities and product candidates we may need to expand our workforce including in the areas of manufacturing clinical trials management regulatory affairs and sales and marketing both in and outside the us we continue to face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies academic and other research institutions as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities which has and may continue to increase our labor costs our ability to attract and retain talent in our increasingly competitive environment may be further complicated by evolving employment trends arising from the covid19 pandemic including vaccination mandates increased preferences for remote alternative or flexible work arrangements and other factors our failure to compete effectively for talent could negatively affect sales of our current and any future approved products and could result in material financial legal commercial or reputational harm to our business 

• failure inadequacy breach of or unauthorized access to our it systems or those of our thirdparty service providers unauthorized access to our confidential information or violations of data protection laws could each result in material harm to our business and reputation 

a great deal of confidential information owned by us or our business partners or other third parties is stored in our information systems networks and facilities or those of third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property clinical trial information corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information collectively confidential information we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems infrastructure and hardware together it systems some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties to accumulate process store and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy data protection and data security maintaining the security confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business our failure or the failure of our third party service providers to protect and maintain the security confidentiality integrity and availability of our or their it systems and our confidential information and other data could significantly harm our reputation as well as result in significant costs including those related to fines litigation and obligations to comply with applicable data breach laws 

it systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources cyberattacks are growing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect mitigate or prevent cyberattacks come in many forms including the deployment of harmful malware exploitation of vulnerabilities including those of thirdparty software or systems denialofservice attacks the use of social engineering and other means to compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems confidential information and other data breaches resulting in the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our it systems products and services can occur in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information or wrongful conduct by hackers competitors certain governments or nationstates or other current or former company personnel our thirdparty partners including thirdparty providers of data hosting or cloud services as well as suppliers distributors alliances and other third parties with whom we may share data face similar risks which could affect us directly or indirectly the healthcare industry has been and continues to be a target for cyberattacks and the number of threats has only increased over time numerous federal agencies that monitor and regulate internet and cybercrime have issued guidance alerts and directives warning of software vulnerabilities that require immediate patching malicious actors targeting healthcare related systems and nationstate sponsored hacking designed to steal valuable information 

the failure inadequacy or breach of our it systems or business processes the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized access to disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems or business processes could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems or business processes damage our operations customer relationships or reputation result in unfavorable clinical trial results by virtue of incorrect or unreliable data andor cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company in addition it system security in jurisdictions outside the us is weaker and may result in additional costs uncertainties and risks 

to date system inadequacies operating failures unauthorized access service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks and the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our it systems we continue to implement measures in an effort to protect detect respond to and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our it systems however these measures may not be successful and we may fail to detect or remediate security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks or other compromises of our systems any of these events could result in material financial legal commercial or reputational harm to our business 

• significant economic downturns or international trade and other global disruptions or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results 

while pharmaceuticals have generally been less sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products affecting our sales volume declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay for our products in a timely manner also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners similarly in the event of a significant economic downturn we could have difficulty accessing credit markets 

significant portions of our business are conducted in europe including the united kingdom in asia including china and in other international geographies trade and other global disputes and interruptions in international relationships including related to tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the us or other governments unrest or war as well as pandemic diseases such as covid19 affect our ability to do business for example tensions between the us and china have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the us on imports from china mainland as well as other business restrictions these and similar events could adversely affect us or our business partners or customers 

• pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues income and reputation 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients accordingly we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval have and could in the future result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues have and could in the future result in costly product liability claims see also   the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations we are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future 

• we face litigation and investigations related to our products how we price our products and how we commercialize our products we could face large numbers of claims in the future which could adversely affect our business and we are selfinsured for such matters 

we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving various current and historical products litigation and investigations related to how we commercialize andor how we price our products including relating to our 340b drug pricing program as well as contractual disputes see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies for more information on our current product liability litigation as well as pricing litigation investigations and inquiries because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for our previous current or future products or to further litigation or investigations including related to pricing or other commercial practices such matters could affect our results of operations or require us to recognize substantial charges to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance we are selfinsured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters 

• manufacturing and supply chain difficulties disruptions or shortages could lead to product supply problems 

pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities or increases in demand on a supplier could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products andor product shortages leading to lost revenue further global transportation and logistics challenges as well as tight labor markets have caused and in the future may cause delays in andor increase costs related to distribution of our medicines the construction or other acquisition of manufacturing capacity procurement activity and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements such difficulties disruptions or challenges could result from quality oversight or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters or pandemic disease equipment mechanical data or information technology system vulnerabilities such as system inadequacies inadequate controls or procedures operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources labor shortages contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers or inability to obtain singlesource or other raw or intermediate materials in addition difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our 

products and indications and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity from time to time result in difficulty meeting demand for or disruptions shortages and higher costs in the supply of our products see item 1 business  raw materials and product supply for more details 

• reliance on thirdparty relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business 

we rely on third parties including suppliers distributors alliances and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product and clinical development manufacturing commercialization hosting of and support for information technology systems product distribution and certain financial transactional processes as examples we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations and the distribution of our products through logistics providers outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us our clinical trial subjects or patients may experience disruption or fail to perform due to information technology system vulnerabilities breaches cyberattacks or inadequate controls or procedures may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us in which case we may not be able to achieve acceptable alternative sourcing or may fail to perform at all the foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the us where we may face additional costs uncertainties and risks failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality privacy security or other obligations to us our clinical trial subjects and our patients could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to government regulation 

• our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing reimbursement and access for our drugs which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business 

public and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medicines these pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of and actions intended to address pricing reimbursement and access to pharmaceutical products additional policies regulations legislation or enforcement including as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current us presidential administration and other regulatory authorities worldwide could adversely impact our business and revenue for example pending legislation in the us could result in government negotiation of the price of some of our medicines including insulin furthermore restrictive or unfavorable pricing coverage or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments regulatory agencies or private payers such as the recently proposed alzheimer’s monoclonal antibody ncd may adversely impact our business and financial results however we cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of current and future health care reform efforts we also may continue to experience potential additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the covid19 pandemic on governmentfunded healthcare systems around the world

• changes in foreign currency rates interest rate risks or inflation could materially affect our results of operations 

as a global company we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and variable interest rates and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the us and other jurisdictions while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates interest rates and inflation can have a material impact either positive or negative on our 

results of operations further in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market in addition the discontinuation modification or other reform of the london interbank offered rate libor or the replacement of libor with a different reference rate could increase our interest expense decrease our cash flows andor require us to amend certain of our existing agreements see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  financial condition and liquidity and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and implementation of new financial accounting standard for more details 

• changes in tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the course of our business we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events changes in tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations as well as events that differ from our expectations have affected and may adversely affect our effective tax rates cash flows andor and results of operations for example in december 2017 the us enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising us tax laws and a number of other countries are also actively considering or enacting tax changes significant uncertainty currently exists regarding proposed tax policies of the current us presidential administration and congress including modifications to certain aspects of the 2017 tax law in addition tax authorities in the us and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions which could unfavorably impact our results of operations further actions taken with respect to taxrelated matters by associations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development and the european commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate modifications to key elements of the current us or international tax framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate results of operations and cash flows see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  tax matters and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 14 income taxes for more details 

• regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including us have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us we are and could in the future become subject to such investigations the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs such investigations have intensified and may continue to intensify as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current us presidential administration and other regulatory authorities worldwide in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp quality assurance and similar regulations and comparable foreign regulations for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages import bans or denials of import certifications delays or denials in the approvals of new products or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues and reputational harm any of which would adversely affect our business regulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the us may also be less predictable and result in additional costs uncertainties and risks see item 1 business  government regulation of our operations for more details

executive overview 

this section provides an overview of our financial results recent product and latestage pipeline developments and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry earnings per share eps data are presented on a diluted basis 

covid19 pandemic 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have focused on maintaining a supply of our medicines reducing the strain on the medical system developing treatments for covid19 protecting the health safety and wellbeing of our employees supporting our communities and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines particularly insulin as part of our response to the covid19 pandemic and at the request of the united states us and international governments we invested in largescale manufacturing of covid19 antibodies at risk in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world 

the us food and drug administration fda granted emergency use authorizations eua for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for higherrisk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mildtomoderate covid19 and for baricitinib for treatment with or without remdesivir in hospitalized covid19 patients in the third quarter of 2021 the fda expanded the eua for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to include postexposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of sarscov2 infection we expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited in february 2022 the fda granted an eua for bebtelovimab for certain highrisk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mildtomoderate covid19 we have agreed with the us government to supply up to 600000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than march 31 2022 for at least 720 million with an option of 500000 additional doses no later than july 31 2022 the fda has revised and may in the future revise any eua for our covid19 therapies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our therapies have varying degrees of efficacy 

the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations the focus of resources on covid19 widespread protective measures implemented to control the spread of covid19 and the resulting strain on global transportation manufacturing and labor markets have negatively impacted development manufacturing supply distribution and sales of our medicines in addition to decreases in new prescriptions changes in payer segment mix and the increased use of patient affordability programs in the us we have experienced and may continue to experience if the covid19 pandemic undergoes resurgent or more severe waves decreased demand as a result of lack of normal access and fewer inperson interactions by patients and our employees with healthcare professionals 

we also face risks and uncertainties related to our covid19 therapies including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices quality assurance and similar regulations restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies and risks related to handling return andor refund of product after delivery by us the availability of superior or competitive therapies including therapies that can be administered more easily or preventative measures such as vaccines coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for our covid19 therapies mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus have in some cases impacted the effectiveness of our covid19 therapies and may further render our therapies more or less effective or ineffective 

the strain on global transportation logistics and labor markets caused by the covid19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials resulting in changed buying patterns and constrained supply have had and may continue to have a number of impacts on our business including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and potential disruptions in the supply of our medications these factors may negatively affect our results of operations 

it remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on us the degree to which the covid19 pandemic continues to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control we are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future 

see item 1a risk factors for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations 

financial results 

the following table summarizes our key operating results 



nm  not meaningful 

revenue increased in 2021 driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower realized prices operating expenses defined as the sum of research and development and marketing selling and administrative expenses increased in 2021 driven primarily by higher development expenses for latestage assets the decreases in net income and eps in 2021 were driven primarily by reduction in othernet income expense and higher operating expenses partially offset by higher gross margin 

the following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2021 and 2020 financial results 

cost of sales see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

• we recognized a net inventory impairment charge related to our covid19 antibodies of 3397 million as part of our response to the covid19 pandemic and at the request of the us and international governments we invested in largescale manufacturing of covid19 antibodies at risk in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world as the covid19 pandemic evolved during 2021 we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from us and international governments including changes to our agreement with the us government and nearterm expiry dates of covid19 antibodies 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

• we recognized acquired iprd charges of 8749 million related to business development transactions 

asset impairment restructuring and other special charges note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

asset impairment restructuring and other special charges note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

• we recognized charges of 1312 million primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure 

othernet income expense note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

• we recognized 144 billion of net investment gains on equity securities 

latestage pipeline 

our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new medicines we currently have approximately 45 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase 

the following certain new molecular entities nmes are currently in phase ii or phase iii clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review in the us europe or japan the following table reflects the status of certain nmes including certain other developments since our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2021 





1 in collaboration with almirall sa in europe 

2 fast track designation is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs 

3 breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of potential medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint 

4 continued approval may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory phase iii trials 

5 in collaboration with innovent biologics inc 

our pipeline also contains several new indication line extension nilex products the following certain nilex products for use in the indication described are currently in phase ii or phase iii clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review in the us europe or japan the following table reflects the status of certain nilex products including certain other developments since our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2021

3 fast track designation is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs 

4 the fda granted eua for treatment with or without remdesivir in hospitalized covid19 patients 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products as well as a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses label changes changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue cash flows and earnings 

in 2021 our vitamin regimen patents for alimta ® expired worldwide following the loss of patent exclusivity in major european countries and japan we faced and remain exposed to generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels in the us we expect pediatric data exclusivity to provide us with protection through may 2022 however we and eagle pharmaceuticals inc eagle reached an agreement in december 2019 to settle all pending us patent litigation allowing eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting february 2022 up to an approximate threeweek supply and subsequent unlimited entry starting april 2022 we expect that the entry of generic competition in the us following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue and will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending regarding among others our alimta patents 

our compound patent for humalog ® insulin lispro has expired in major markets global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro a competitor has similar version of insulin lispro in the us and in certain european markets while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that may continue over time 

our formulation and use patents for forteo ® have expired in major markets we expect further decline in revenue as a result of the entry of generic and biosimilar competition due to the loss of patent exclusivity in major markets 

our regulatory data and patent exclusivity for cymbalta ® expired in japan beginning in mid2021 we have faced and remain exposed to generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and chinese yuan while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on operating expenses while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates fluctuations in these rates could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

global concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate as well as worldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities such measures may include the use of mandated discounts price reporting requirements mandated reference prices restrictive formularies changes to available intellectual property protections as well as other efforts in addition consolidation of private payors in the us has significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates furthermore restrictive or unfavorable pricing coverage or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments regulatory agencies or private payers such as the recently proposed alzheimer’s monoclonal antibody national coverage determination may adversely impact our business and financial results we expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products such as insulin as governments manage and emerge from the covid19 pandemic which could adversely affect our business in addition we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340b program that if resolved adversely to us could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations it is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide 

in addition evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations and our industry including with respect to current good manufacturing practices quality assurance and similar regulations and increased focus on business combinations in our industry any regulatory issues concerning these matters could lead to regulatory and legal actions product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages import bans or denials of import certifications delays or denials in the approvals of new products or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues impediments to the completion of business combinations and reputational harm any of which would adversely affect our business

we are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions therefore changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate results of operations and cash flows in 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act which contains a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022 previously these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred while this provision of the 2017 tax act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations if it is not deferred or repealed by congress we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to 150 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the fiveyear amortization period 

the us and countries around the world are actively considering and enacting tax law changes tax proposals introduced by congress and the us presidential administration contain significant changes including increases to the tax rates at which both domestic and foreign income of us companies would be taxed in addition tax authorities in the us and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions which could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows further actions taken with respect to taxrelated matters by associations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development and the european commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate 

acquisitions 

we opportunistically invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including acquisitions collaborations investments and licensing arrangements we view our business development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business 

in january 2021 we acquired all shares of prevail for a purchase price that included 2250 per share in cash or an aggregate of 7474 million net of cash acquired plus one nontradable contingent value right cvr per share the cvr entitles prevail stockholders up to an additional 400 per share in cash or an aggregate of approximately 160 million payable subject to certain terms and conditions upon the first regulatory approval of a prevail product in one of the following countries us japan united kingdom germany france italy or spain under the terms of the agreement we acquired potentially diseasemodifying aav9based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases the acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by prevails portfolio of assets 

in february 2020 we acquired all shares of dermira inc for a purchase price of 8493 million net of cash acquired under the terms of the agreement we acquired lebrikizumab a novel investigational monoclonal antibody being evaluated for the treatment of moderatetosevere atopic dermatitis lebrikizumab was granted fast track designation from the fda we also acquired qbrexza cloth a medicated cloth for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating in 2021 we sold the rights to qbrexza see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of the rights to qbrexza 

in february 2019 we acquired all shares of loxo for a purchase price of 692 billion net of cash acquired under the terms of the agreement we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines including selpercatinib an oral ret inhibitor and loxo305 pirtobrutinib an oral btk inhibitor in the second quarter of 2020 the fda approved selpercatinib retevmo under its accelerated approval regulations and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials

revenue 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity by region 



the following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year 



numbers may not add due to rounding 

in the us the increase in volume in 2021 was primarily driven by covid19 antibodies trulicity ®  and taltz ®  

outside the us the increase in volume in 2021 was primarily driven by trulicity olumiant covid19 antibodies verzenio and taltz the decrease in realized prices outside the us was primarily driven by the price impact of the updated national reimbursement drug list formulary for certain products largely tyvyt ®  in china 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2021 compared with 2020 



numbers may not add due to rounding 

nm  not meaningful 

1 humalog revenue includes insulin lispro 

2 covid19 antibodies include sales for bamlanivimab administered alone as well as sales for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together and were made pursuant to euas or similar regulatory authorizations 

3 jardiance revenue includes glyxambi ®  synjardy ®  and trijardy ® xr 

4 olumiant revenue includes sales for baricitinib for treatment in hospitalized covid19 patients that were made pursuant to eua or similar regulatory authorizations 

5 trajenta revenue includes jentadueto ®  

revenue of trulicity a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors increased 28 percent in the us driven by increased demand revenue outside the us increased 26 percent driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower realized prices 

revenue of humalog an injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes decreased 11 percent in the us primarily driven by lower realized prices humalogs lower realized prices in the us in 2021 were driven by higher contracted rebates and discounts and increased utilization in more highlyrebated government segments partially offset by lower utilization in the 340b segment revenue outside the us decreased 1 percent driven by decreased volume and to a lesser extent lower realized prices largely offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates included in the revenue of humalog in the us are our own insulin lispro authorized generics while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue however due to the impact of competition and due to pricing pressure in the us and some international markets we expect some price decline and loss of market share to continue over time 

revenue of covid19 antibodies treatments for mild to moderate covid19 for higherrisk patients and for postexposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of sarscov2 infection was 198 billion in the us during the year ended december 31 2021 revenue outside the us was 2614 million during the year ended december 31 2021 the availability of superior or competitive therapies including therapies that can be administered more easily or preventative measures such as vaccines coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for these covid19 antibodies the fda has revised and may in the future revise any eua for our covid19 antibodies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy we expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited 

revenue of taltz a treatment for moderatetosevere plaque psoriasis active psoriatic arthritis ankylosing spondylitis and active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis increased 20 percent in the us driven by increased demand partially offset by lower realized prices due to increased rebates to gain commercial access revenue outside the us increased 34 percent primarily driven by increased volume 

revenue of alimta a treatment for various cancers decreased 2 percent in the us driven by decreased volume partially offset by higher realized prices revenue outside the us decreased 22 percent primarily driven by decreased volume due to the entry of generic competition in certain markets and to a lesser extent lower realized prices partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates following the loss of exclusivity in major european countries and japan in june 2021 we faced and remain exposed to generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels in the us we expect the limited entry of generic competition starting february 2022 and subsequent unlimited entry starting april 2022 we expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in the us will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue see executive overview  other matters patent matters for additional information 

revenue of jardiance a treatment for type 2 diabetes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction increased 30 percent in the us primarily driven by increased demand revenue outside the us increased 28 percent primarily driven by increased volume see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim involving jardiance 

revenue of verzenio a treatment for hr her2 metastatic breast cancer and high risk early breast cancer increased 35 percent in the us driven by increased demand revenue outside the us increased 75 percent driven by increased volume 

revenue of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes decreased 4 percent in the us driven by decreased demand and to a lesser extent lower realized prices revenue outside the us decreased 1 percent driven by decreased volume largely offset by higher realized prices and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of olumiant a treatment for adults with moderatelytoseverely active rheumatoid arthritis moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and of baricitinib a treatment with or without remdesivir of hospitalized patients with covid19 increased 2603 million in the us driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent higher realized prices revenue outside the us increased 38 percent driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower realized prices increased volume worldwide was partially driven by utilization of olumiant for the treatment of hospitalized patients with covid19 

revenue of cyramza a treatment for various cancers decreased 6 percent in the us driven by decreased demand partially offset by higher realized prices revenue outside the us increased 4 percent driven by increased volume partially offset by lower realized prices 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of revenue was 742 percent in 2021 a decrease of 35 percentage points compared with 2020 driven by higher sales of covid19 antibodies 

research and development expenses increased 15 percent to 703 billion in 2021 primarily driven by higher development expenses for latestage assets 

marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 5 percent to 643 billion in 2021 primarily due to increased marketing costs to continue to drive growth for certain products investment in preparation for new launches and lower marketing activities in 2020 as a result of pandemicrelated spending reductions 

we recognized acquired iprd charges of 8749 million and 6604 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to business development transactions see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 3161 million in 2021 the charges were primarily related to an impairment of a contractbased intangible asset from our acquisition of loxo an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to qbrexza as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of prevail in 2020 we recognized 1312 million of asset impairment restructuring and other special charges primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure 

other—net income expense was expense of 2016 million in 2021 compared to income of 117 billion in 2020 primarily driven by lower net investment gains on equity securities and a debt extinguishment loss of 4052 million related to the repurchase of debt 

our effective tax rate was 93 percent in 2021 compared with an effective tax rate of 143 percent in 2020 primarily driven by the tax impacts of acquired iprd charges lower net investment gains on equity securities as well as a net discrete tax benefit 

operating results—2020 

for a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2020 and 2019 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our available cash and cash equivalents together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to shortterm and longterm borrowings are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements which include 

• working capital requirements including related to employee payroll clinical trials manufacturing materials and taxes 

• capital expenditures 

• share repurchases and dividends 

• repayment of outstanding shortterm and longterm borrowings 

• contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 

• milestone and royalty payments and 

• potential business development activities including acquisitions collaborations investments and licensing arrangements 

our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources including our access to external capital to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements as of december 31 2021 our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations capital equipment expenditures dividends repayment of outstanding borrowings milestone and royalty payments the remaining obligations for the onetime repatriation transition tax also known as the toll tax from the 2017 tax act leases unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds and retirement benefits see notes 11 4 14 10 7 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements we anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues 

beginning in 2022 the 2017 tax act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred while this provision of the 2017 tax act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations if it is not deferred or repealed by congress we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to 150 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the fiveyear amortization period see results of operations  executive overview  other matters tax matters for additional information 

we plan to invest more than 1 billion over several years in a new facility in concord north carolina to manufacture parenteral injectable products and devices we plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in limerick ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients 

cash and cash equivalents increased to 382 billion as of december 31 2021 compared with 366 billion at december 31 2020 net cash provided by operating activities was 726 billion in 2021 compared with 650 billion in 2020 refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

in addition to our cash and cash equivalents we held total investments of 330 billion and 299 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in january 2021 we acquired all shares of prevail for a purchase price that included 2250 per share in cash or an aggregate of 7474 million net of cash acquired plus one nontradable cvr per share the cvr entitles prevail stockholders up to an additional 400 per share in cash or an aggregate of approximately 160 million payable subject to certain terms and conditions this acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of december 31 2021 total debt was 1688 billion an increase of 2894 million compared with 1660 billion at december 31 2020 in september 2021 we issued eurodenominated notes consisting of €5000 million of 1125 percent fixedrate notes due in september 2051 and €7000 million of 1375 percent fixedrate notes due in september 2061 with interest to be paid annually and british pounddenominated notes consisting of £2500 million of 1625 percent fixedrate notes due in september 2043 with interest to be paid annually we paid 191 billion of the net cash proceeds from the offering to purchase and redeem certain higher interest rate us dollardenominated notes with an aggregate principal amount of 150 billion we used the remaining net proceeds from the offering to prefund certain 2022 debt maturities and for general corporate purposes in addition in september 2021 we issued eurodenominated notes consisting of €6000 million of 050 percent fixedrate notes due in september 2033 with interest to be paid annually the net proceeds from the offering will be used to fund in whole or in part eligible projects designed to advance one or more of our environmental social and governance objectives see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of december 31 2021 we had a total of 526 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 500 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any shortterm borrowing needs 

for the 136 th consecutive year we distributed dividends to our shareholders dividends of 340 per share and 296 per share were paid in 2021 and 2020 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2021 effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2022 the quarterly dividend was increased to 098 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2022 of 392 per share 

capital expenditures of 131 billion during 2021 compared to 139 billion in 2020 

in 2021 we repurchased 100 billion of shares which completed our 800 billion share repurchase program authorized in june 2018 additionally our board authorized a 500 billion share repurchase program in may 2021 in 2021 we repurchased 2500 million of shares under the 500 billion share repurchase program as of december 31 2021 we had 475 billion remaining under the 500 billion share repurchase program see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates currency values and fair values of equity securities these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance as of december 31 2021 substantially all of our total longterm debt carries interest at a fixed rate we have converted approximately 13 percent of our longterm fixedrate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2021 and 2020 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and chinese yuan we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the euro the japanese yen and chinese yuan our corporate riskmanagement policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2021 and 2020 would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our carrying values of these investments were 183 billion and 204 billion respectively a hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted othernet income expense by 3656 million and 4076 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 

individually these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows respectively in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts product sales to customers net product revenue and collaborations and other arrangements for product sales to customers provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts significant judgments are required in making these estimates the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care medicare medicaid chargeback and patient assistance programs in the us in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries and product launches an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs and our product pricing 

refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration as well as royalties upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts 

financial statement impact 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate 366 million effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our consolidated sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was approximately 90 percent as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us sales return rebate and discount liability balances including managed care medicare medicaid chargeback and patient assistance programs 



1 adjustments of the estimates for these returns rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 1 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented 

litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

background and uncertainties 

litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation as applicable and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance we are selfinsured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we consider any thirdparty indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated with respect to our thirdparty indemnification rights these considerations include the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

acquisitions 

background and uncertainties 

to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition we make certain judgments which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules 

if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets where applicable is recorded as goodwill if the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and therefore any acquired iprd that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as well as estimated asset lives can materially affect our consolidated results of operations the fair values of intangible assets including acquired iprd are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management significant estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to probability of technical success revenue growth and discount rate depending on the facts and circumstances we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities 

the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments including but not limited to probability of technical success and the discount rate 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2021 a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of 35 million 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

background and uncertainties 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the assets net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require managements judgment actual results could vary materially from these estimates 

retirement benefits assumptions 

background and uncertainties 

defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate expected return on plan assets and retirement age these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected return on plan assets we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 75 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

annually we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans approximately 38 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equitylike investment funds collectively alternative assets we value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty adjusted as necessary inputs include underlying net asset values discounted cash flows valuations comparable market valuations and adjustments for currency credit liquidity and other risks 

financial statement impact 

if the 2021 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 216 million if the 2021 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 315 million if our assumption regarding the 2021 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 511 million the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 80 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at december 31 2021 

adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur such changes are deferred along with other actuarial gains and losses and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees 

income taxes 

background and uncertainties 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based upon these interpretations our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities which could result in future tax interest and penalty assessments inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of a tax examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses tax credits and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2021 a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 849 million and 438 million respectively

marketing and distribution 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations 

us 

we promote our major products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we also promote to healthcare providers in medical journals and online health care channels distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations group purchasing organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

in the us most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies physicians and other health care professionals and hospitals in 2020 2019 and 2018 three wholesale distributors in the us—mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of our consolidated revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years 

outside the us 

outside the us we promote our products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and online health care channels while the products we market vary from country to country diabetes products constitute the largest single group of our consolidated revenue distribution patterns for our products also vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

marketing collaborations 

certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for example we and boehringer ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products including trajenta jentadueto ®  jardiance glyxambi ®  synjardy ®  trijardy ® xr and basaglar 

for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

competition 

our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets 

important competitive factors include effectiveness safety and ease of use formulary placement price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes modalities and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors when competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages including by developing new modalities our products become subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends on discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will be or will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and europe the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product as a result generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product which can cause us to lose a significant portion of the product’s revenue in a very short period of time 

further public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products 

biosimilars 

several of our products and approximately half of the potential new medicines in our clinicalstage pipeline are biologics in the us the us food and drug administration fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulations competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic approval by the fda ultimately depends on many factors including a showing that the biosimilar is “highly similar” to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety purity and potency 

globally most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as followons to innovatordeveloped biologics including the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 the bpcia in the us and a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the bpcia and in europe the patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market however in the us the product exclusivity period under the bpcia could be affected by recent government proposals and litigation see “ patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” in addition the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing in the us currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be “interchangeable” will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in a patient that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro that competes with our product humalog on the other hand in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar a new insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a followon biologic in the us and as a biosimilar in europe and japan however in march 2020 the fda began regulating all of our insulin products as “biologics” rather than “drugs” based on fda draft guidance this change may lower the requirements for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at us pharmacies as such in june 2020 mylan nv announced that the fda approved its new drug application nda for semglee a new insulin glargine product which it launched as a followon biologic in the us that competes with basaglar the laws regulating biosimilars continue to be interpreted and implemented by the fda and remain subject to substantial uncertainty including with respect to their impact on our business 

us private sector dynamics 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals health plans pharmacy benefit managers wholesalers and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance private thirdparty insurers as well as governments typically maintain formularies that specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion 

formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates valuebased agreements where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcomes are another tool that may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable we expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations in addition to formulary placement changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer costsharing through high deductible plans and higher coinsurance or copays for additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products see “ regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access  us” 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section below in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

• patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all us patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the united states patent and trademark office uspto 

• patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to us patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the fda to make up for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the fda review process a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the fda to review an application there is a fiveyear cap on any restoration and no patents expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from fda approval some countries outside the us also offer forms of patent term restoration for example supplementary protection certificates are available to extend the life of a european patent up to an additional five years subject to a 15year cap from european medicines agency ema approval similarly in japan south korea and australia patent terms can be extended up to five years depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors 

loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals especially for nonbiologic products typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product however in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic biosimilar or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on manufacturing processes methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

• regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval based on the innovator company’s regulatory submission data for the drug the base period of data package protection depends on the country for example the period is generally five years in the us 12 years for new biologics as described below effectively 10 years in europe and eight years in japan the period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent 

• under the bpcia the fda has the authority to approve biosimilars a competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the fda will consider on a casebycase basis under the data protection provisions of this law the fda cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic subject to certain conditions the bpcia is part of the affordable care act the constitutionality of which is currently being litigated 

• in the us the fda has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period if granted this “pediatric exclusivity” provides an additional six months of exclusivity which is added to the term of data protection as well as to the term of any relevant patents to the extent these protections have not already expired while the term of the pediatric exclusivity attaches to the term of any relevant patent pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity—ie a bar to generic approval not a patent right 

• under the us orphan drug law a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive orphan designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200000 people in the us or affecting more than 200000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through us sales among other benefits orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity meaning that the fda cannot with limited exceptions approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the sevenyear period unlike pediatric exclusivity the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents 

outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement thus some types of patents such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules are not available in certain developing countries further many developing countries and some developed countries do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trips 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes uses and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations in addition to the data protection and patents identified below we may hold patents on manufacturing processes formulations devices or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our topselling or recently launched patentprotected marketed products are as follows

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks consisting of our product names logos and unique product appearances eg the appearance of our trulicity autoinjector which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms trademark protection often extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product 

patent licenses and collaborations 

most of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements for information on our license and collaboration agreements including our agreement with incyte corporation related to olumiant see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biologics which are discussed below in more detail when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after certain of the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more or all of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” if the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in hatchwaxman litigation involving alimta with a single generic manufacturer for more information on hatchwaxman litigation involving the company see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies” 

under the bpcia the fda cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved however the bpcia does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator’s patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic 

the patent litigation scheme under the bpcia and the bpcia itself is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda as well as courts courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the bpcia patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration further in the us the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators’ intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators’ market exclusivity see also “ competition  biosimilars” 

in addition there is a procedure in us patent law known as inter partes review ipr which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued us patent for validity iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the ipr process in attempts to invalidate our patents 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us

government regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies 

regulation of products 

the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers the environment occupational health and safety and data privacy compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance to our business is regulation by the fda in the us pursuant to laws and regulations that include the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing promotion advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products 

following approval our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling import export storage recordkeeping advertising promotion and safety reporting we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell the fda may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market the fda strictly regulates marketing labeling advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the ema in europe and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country regulatory requirements and approval processes outside the us may differ from those in the us and may involve additional costs and uncertainties 

we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing product development and process development operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements we become subject to potential government investigations interruptions in production fines and penalties delays in new product approvals and reputational harm certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals any determination by the fda or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations that may affect our research development or production efforts 

emergency use authorizations 

the secretary of health and human services may authorize unapproved medical products to be manufactured marketed and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government after an emergency has been announced the secretary of health and human services may authorize euas for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing treating or preventing serious or lifethreatening diseases when there are no adequate approved and available alternatives an eua is subject to additional conditions and restrictions such as the obligation to provide facts sheets for healthcare providers administering the product and those to whom it is administered adverse event monitoring and reporting and recordkeeping and reporting requirements by product manufacturers the fda may also establish additional discretionary conditions of authorization that the fda deems necessary or appropriate to protect the public health including conditions related to product distribution product administration and data collection and analysis concerning the safety and effectiveness of the product in issuing an eua the fda considers the totality of available scientific evidence regarding quality safety and efficacy including the known and potential risks of such products and the adequacy and availability of approved alternatives among other factors an eua is not a substitute for obtaining fda approval licensure or clearance for use of a product an eua terminates when the emergency determination underlying the eua terminates and euas can be revoked under other circumstances the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict 

outside the us the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that differ from those in the us 

the covid19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the us on the basis of such determination the secretary of health and human services declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the covid19 pandemic the fda has granted euas for bamlanivimab bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together and baricitinib in combination with remdesivir and similar actions have been taken by other regulators in certain jurisdictions outside the us we intend to submit bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to the fda for approval in the second half of 202 1 

other laws and regulations 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to various other us federal and state laws as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations including the federal antikickback statute the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years state and federal governments have increased their oversight enforcement activities and intraagency coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies further several claims brought by these agencies against us and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements 

in december 2020 the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services and the centers for medicare  medicaid services issued final rules expanding and modifying existing and adding new regulatory “safe harbors” and exceptions respectively under the antikickback statute and the ethics in patient referrals act we are currently evaluating the impact if any these regulatory amendments will have upon becoming effective on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position which is uncertain at this time 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

we are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations that may affect our research development or production efforts 

regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

us 

there continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and measures to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals are being considered at various levels of state and federal government in addition us government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products additionally there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products the regulatory priorities of the current us presidential administration could further intensify these efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs including state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of health care facilities intended to serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an “average sales price plus 43 percent” formula additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs since 2019 the bipartisan budget act has required manufacturers of brandname drugs biologics and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage an increase from the previous 50 percent discount 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we pay rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare may be impacted by recent regulatory amendments included in the antikickback statute final rule that will become effective on january 1 2023 

outside the us 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes in addition thirdparty organizations including professional associations academic institutions and nonprofit entities associated with payers are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and costbenefit analyses on medicines the impact of which are uncertain at this time 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution we may experience additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the covid19 pandemic on governmentfunded healthcare systems around the world 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer developments however in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products 

see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” for additional information regarding recent legislative administrative and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2020 we employed approximately 7600 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel 

our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of diabetes oncology immunology neurodegeneration and pain during 2020 we also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for covid19 in addition to discovering and developing new medicines we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines we actively invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including among others licensing arrangements codevelopment agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures acquisitions and equity investments 

pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

• discovery phase 

in the discovery phase scientists identify design and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans the discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low 

• early development phase 

early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals as necessary in general the first human tests often referred to as phase i are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range subsequently larger populations of patients are studied phase ii to identify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the candidates that enter the early development phase approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase the early development phase varies but can take several years to complete 

• late development phase 

late phase development projects typically phase iii have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies as a result these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease these studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies placebo or both phase iii studies are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval the duration of phase iii testing varies by disease and may take two to four years 

• submission phase 

once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on the disease state the strength and complexity of available data the degree of unmet need and the time required for the regulatory agencyies to evaluate the submission which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new medicines and new treatment indications in all stages of development we currently have approximately 45 candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline” for more information on certain of our product candidates 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier or significant unanticipated increases in demand on a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the us including puerto rico and ireland finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that is intended to allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems inventory management and backup sites 

however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience unplanned plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities significant failure of a contract supplier or significant unanticipated increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

in addition covid19 could also have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations global supply chain and distribution systems which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products and affect the ability of third parties on which we rely to fulfill their obligations to us and could increase our expenses for more information see item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business  the covid19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have impacted and may in future periods negatively impact our business and operations” and item 7 “managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  covid19 pandemic” 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination thereof additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at thirdparty suppliers 

executive officers of the company 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers 

the term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors to be held on may 3 2021 in connection with the companys annual meeting of shareholders or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified no director or executive officer has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive officer of the company as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement there is no understanding between any executive officer or director and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected 



human capital management 

our core values—integrity excellence and respect for people—shape our approach to attracting retaining engaging and developing a highly skilled and ethical workforce which is critical to executing our strategy we believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial performance and enables us to make life better for people around the world for instance most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new medicines we believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success 

we are committed to creating a safe supportive ethical and rewarding work environment through strategic focus on our human capital management process fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices robust training and development opportunities and competitive pay and benefits we believe our dedication to promoting diversity and inclusion di within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business success and growth 

we regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics these results are reviewed and analyzed by our leaders in order to implement changes to our policies and benefits designed to improve our employees wellbeing as a result of our efforts we believe that we have a highly performing cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good 

at the end of 2020 we employed approximately 35000 people including approximately 19500 employees outside the us our employees include approximately 7600 people engaged in research and development activities 

strategy and oversight 

in order to build diverse and inclusive teams our ceo and executive committee set expectations for inclusive leadership and hold leaders accountable for achieving results because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance our board of directors regularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part of the overarching framework that guides how we attract retain engage and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and mission 

diversity and inclusion 

we are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices and we deeply value diverse backgrounds skills and global perspectives to fulfill our purpose we believe we must look at challenges from multiple viewpoints and understand the diverse experiences of the patients who depend on us 

we believe that fostering di begins with understanding for example our employee journeys research has yielded important insights about the experiences of women blackafrican american latinx asian and lesbian gay bisexual transgender or queer lgbtq employees at lilly the results of this research are reviewed by our senior leadership and we deploy actions and activities in response to these insights to improve our workplace and corporate culture 

since 2017 we have committed to increasing the number of women blackafrican american latinx and asian populations in leadership roles and we actively monitor our progress from the end of 2017 through the end of 2020 we increased the number of women in management globally from 41 percent to 46 percent for minority group members mgm in the us over the same period we increased management representation from 16 percent to 22 percent across all levels of our workforce from the end of 2017 through the end of 2020 we have seen increased representation for mgms in the us and women globally our focus on di is also evident at our executive committee and board of directors seven of 15 members approximately 47 percent of our executive committee which includes our ceo are women and two are mgm including one mgm woman in addition the company’s 15member board of directors includes six women and seven members of underrepresented groups including mgm as well as lgbtq individuals 

our efforts in di and workplace benefits have garnered numerous recognitions including in 2020 and early 2021 top 50 companies for diversity by diversityinc america’s best employers for diversity by forbes america’s most just companies and forbes just 100 by forbes and just capital perfect score on the human rights campaign foundation corporate equality index 2020 and 2021 world’s most ethical companies by ethisphere leading disability employer by the national organization on disability top employers by science magazine america’s most responsible companies by newsweek and 100 best companies top 75 companies for executive women best companies for dads and best companies for multicultural women by working mother magazine 

employee development 

we believe talent begins with the hiring process we therefore require hiring managers to consider a diverse pool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions we believe that hiring in this way helps ensure that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers 

we offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry we also strive to cultivate a culture that promotes ongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences helping them build rewarding careers we have introduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings many training courses are designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs across lilly we are working to design learning experiences to be more inclusive and effective 

to further improve our talent programs and processes in 2019 we introduced explore your career  a global framework of tools and resources for our employees we believe explore your career provides broader access and transparency about career development and advancement at lilly in 2018 we introduced emerge  a threeday program led by our ceo that is designed to develop mgm talent at lilly and three cohorts comprising blackafrican american women latinx and asian women and mgm men have participated in this enterpriselevel program since its inception lilly also offers established leadership development programs for women and earlier career multicultural talent as well as leaders at all levels 

employee resource groups ergs are another important component of developing talent at lilly we currently have 10 ergs representing groups including women mgms lgbtq individuals and people with disabilities ergs offer our diverse workforce opportunities to build relationships engage with senior leaders advance our caring community and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our business membership in our ergs continues to grow with an estimated 11430 people participating worldwide at the end of 2020 

in furtherance of our efforts to create an inclusive workplace in 2020 we expanded make it safe to thrive  an education and awareness program to help employees and leaders understand how individual psychological safety can be created and enhanced with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and to share their ideas at work the program includes live and online training and a monthly video series 

employee health and safety 

while we have consistently focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees the covid19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of this critical priority in response to the pandemic we have taken measures to protect our workforce maximize social distancing and inform employees about our policies for example we instituted travel restrictions and remote working arrangements for employees whose roles do not require onsite presence to support employee wellbeing in the us we enhanced local benefits related to health care childcare and time off and expanded reimbursement for home office ergonomic support expenditures in the us we provide full coverage for covid19 diagnostic testing and treatment and at our corporate headquarters in indianapolis we provide free onsite testing for employees and members of their household in addition as part of our make it safe to thrive program we partnered with our ergs to offer a series of programs highlighting and addressing challenges faced by erg members during the covid19 pandemic aiming to build understanding of different experiences and to offer ways to be inclusive

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks certain of these risks could also adversely affect the companys reputation additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business and reputation 

risks related to our business 

• the covid19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have impacted and may in future periods negatively impact our business and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has substantially burdened healthcare systems worldwide the focus of resources on covid19 and widespread protective measures implemented to control the spread of the pandemic have impacted discovery research development manufacturing and sales of our medicines as well as those of the broader pharmaceutical industry significant delays or unexpected issues such as higher discontinuation rates or delays accumulating data affecting the timing conduct or regulatory review of our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to commercialize some assets in our product pipeline 

lack of normal access and fewer inperson interactions by patients and our employees with the healthcare system along with concern about the continued supply of medications has resulted and may continue to result in changes in buying patterns throughout the supply chain impacting demand for our products and negatively impacting the consolidated operating results of our underlying business in certain locations in the us and around the world with covid19 outbreaks we temporarily halted inperson interactions by our employees with healthcare providers and increased virtual interactions while inperson interactions have resumed in many locations we may decide to halt such activity in the future and in those cases expect to resume such interactions as it is safe to do so and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirements the covid19 pandemic could also have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations global supply chain and distribution systems which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products and affect the ability of third parties on which we rely to fulfill their obligations to us and could increase our expenses 

we also face unique risks and uncertainties related to our development manufacture and uptake of potential treatments for covid19 including vulnerability to supply chain disruptions higher manufacturing costs difficulties in manufacturing sufficient quantities of our therapies restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies and risks related to handling return andor refund of product after delivery by us expedited authorization processes including our euas for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together have allowed restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety and efficacy data and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our covid19 therapies additionally the availability of superior or competitive therapies or preventative measures such as vaccines coupled with the transient nature of pandemics could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our covid19 therapies in addition we may be required to accept returns of certain product previously shipped pursuant to euas if the relevant eua is revoked or terminated mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus could also render our therapies ineffective any of these risks could prevent us from recouping our substantial investments in the research development and manufacture of our covid19 therapies 

in addition the conditions created by the covid19 pandemic intensify other risks inherent in our business including among other things risks related to drug pricing and access the conduct of clinical trials workplace safety and productivity intellectual property protection product liability and other litigation and the impact of adverse global and local economic conditions 

we have experienced negative impacts to our underlying business including demand for our products due to the covid19 pandemic but the pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity position given the evolving nature of the virus the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows in future periods could change perhaps materially the degree to which the covid19 pandemic affects us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control including but not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic the actions taken to reduce its transmission including widespread availability of vaccines and the speed with which and extent to which more stable economic and operating conditions resume should the covid19 pandemic and any associated recession or depression continue for a prolonged period our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows could be materially impacted by lower revenues and profitability and a lower likelihood of effectively and efficiently developing and launching new medicines 

• pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain we may not succeed in developing licensing or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development the introduction of new products and business development activities to expand our product pipeline 

there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful 

we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products both through our internal efforts and our business development activities sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial position our business development activities to enhance our product pipeline may include acquisitions strategic alliances collaborations investments and licensing arrangements there are substantial risks associated with identifying business development targets and consummating related transactions which may not be completed in a timely manner if at all may not result in successful commercialization of any product and may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny 

see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline” for more details about our current product pipeline 

• we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those products in the next few years which has resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe declines in revenues 

a number of our topselling products including alimta and forteo have recently lost or will lose in the next few years significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as key countries outside the us we have faced and remain exposed to generic competition following the loss of such intellectual property protection in particular we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta in the us following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiologic products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues especially in the us historically outside the us the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the us however generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the us including japan europe and many countries in emerging markets for biologics such as humalog humulin erbitux cyramza trulicity taltz and emgality loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to many factors including development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions generic pharmaceutical companies could also introduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters” and item 1 business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

• our longterm success depends on intellectual property protection if our intellectual property rights are invalidated circumvented or weakened our business will be adversely affected 

our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new medicines without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time depending on local laws and regulations changes to such laws and regulations could reduce protections for our innovative products in the us in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the bpcia which applies to biologic products the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld in addition a separate ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatchwaxman act our patents may be invalidated through this expedited review process although such a decision can be appealed to the courts in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market while a win provides no precedential value meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies for more details 

• we and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and lowercost generic and biosimilar manufacturers and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs 

regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts particularly for biosimilars recent government proposals could make it easier less expensive and less time consuming for competitor products to enter the market some of which could be substituted for our products by pharmacies given the importance of biologic products to our clinicalstage pipeline such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business see item 1 “business  competition” and business  research and development for more details 

• failure inadequacy or breach of our it systems or our business processes regarding confidential information and other data unauthorized access to our confidential information or violations of data protection laws could result in material harm to our business and reputation 

a great deal of confidential information owned by us or our business partners or other third parties is stored in our information systems networks and facilities or those of third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property clinical trial information corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information collectively confidential information we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems infrastructure and hardware together it systems some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties to accumulate process store and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy data protection and data security maintaining the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business 

it systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources cyberattacks are growing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect mitigate or prevent cyberattacks come in many forms including the deployment of harmful malware exploitation of vulnerabilities including those thirdparty software or systems denialofservice attacks the use of social engineering and other means to compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems confidential information and other data breaches resulting in the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services can occur in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information or wrongful conduct by hackers competitors certain governments or nationstates or other current or former company personnel our thirdparty partners including thirdparty providers of data hosting or cloud services as well as suppliers distributors alliances and other thirdparty service providers face similar risks which could affect us directly or indirectly the healthcare industry has been and continues to be a target for cyberattacks and the number of threats has only increased during the covid19 pandemic numerous federal agencies that monitor and regulate internet and cybercrime have issued guidance alerts and directives warning of software vulnerabilities that require immediate patching malicious actors targeting healthcare related systems and nationstate sponsored hacking designed to steal valuable information including related to potential covid19 treatments 

the failure or inadequacy of our it systems or business processes the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized access to disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems or business processes could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems or business processes damage our operations customer relationships or reputation and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company 

to date system inadequacies operating failures unauthorized access service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks and the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our it systems we continue to implement measures in an effort to protect detect respond to and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our it systems however these measures may not be successful and we may fail to detect or remediate security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks or other compromises of our systems any of these events could result in material financial legal commercial or reputational harm to our business 

• significant economic downturns or international trade disruptions or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results 

while pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns including as a result of covid19 could lead to decreased utilization of our products affecting our sales volume declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay for our products in a timely manner also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners similarly in the event of a significant economic downturn we could have difficulty accessing credit markets 

significant portions of our business are conducted in europe including the united kingdom asia and other international geographies trade disputes and interruptions in international relationships including pandemic diseases such as covid19 could result in changes to regulations governing our products and our intellectual property or otherwise affect our ability to do business while we do not expect either circumstance to materially affect our business in a direct manner these and similar events could adversely affect us or our business partners or customers 

• pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues income and reputation 

pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients accordingly we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims see also “  the covid19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have impacted and may in future periods negatively impact our business and operations” 

• we face litigation and investigations related to our products and our pricing practices and are selfinsured we could face large numbers of claims in the future which could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving various products as well as litigation and investigations related to the pricing of our products see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies” for more information on our current product liability litigation as well as pricing litigation investigations and inquiries because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products or to further litigation or investigations including related to pricing or other commercial practices such matters could affect our results of operations or require us to recognize substantial charges to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters 

• manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems 

pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality oversight or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters or pandemic disease equipment mechanical data or information technology system vulnerabilities such as system inadequacies inadequate controls or procedures operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources or inability to obtain singlesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products see item 1 “business  raw materials and product supply” for more details 

• reliance on thirdparty relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business 

we rely on third parties including suppliers distributors alliances and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development manufacturing commercialization support for information technology systems product distribution and certain financial transactional processes for example we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us our clinical trial subjects or patients may experience disruption or fail to perform due to information technology system vulnerabilities breaches cyberattacks or inadequate controls or procedures or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality privacy security or other obligations to us our clinical trial subjects and our patients could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to government regulation 

• our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing reimbursement and access for our drugs which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business 

public and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medications these pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income 

we expect governments and private payers worldwide to intensify their scrutiny of and actions intended to address pricing reimbursement and access to pharmaceutical products additional regulations legislation or enforcement including as a result of the current us presidential administration could adversely impact our revenue however we cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of current and future health care reform efforts we also may experience potential additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the covid19 pandemic on governmentfunded healthcare systems around the world 

for more details see item 1 “business  regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” 

• changes in foreign currency rates or interest rate risks could materially affect our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  financial condition and liquidity” for more details 

• unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the course of our business we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events changes in relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations as well as events that differ from our expectations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates in addition global tax authorities routinely examine our tax returns and are expected to become more aggressive in their examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions which could affect our anticipated tax liabilities in december 2017 the us enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising us tax laws and a number of other countries are also actively considering or enacting tax changes significant uncertainty currently exists regarding proposed tax policies of the current us presidential administration including repeal of certain aspects of the 2017 tax law modifications to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  tax matters” and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 14 income taxes for more details 

we have taken the position based on an opinion of tax counsel that our divestiture of elanco common stock in connection with the 2019 separation of elanco qualifies as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes if any facts assumptions representations and undertakings from lilly and elanco regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied the divestiture may not qualify for taxfree treatment which could result in significant us federal income tax liabilities for us and our shareholders who exchanged their stock for elanco stock 

• regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including us have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us we are and could in the future become subject to such investigations the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs such investigations may intensify as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current us presidential administration in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp quality assurance and similar regulations and comparable foreign regulations for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages import bans or denials of import certifications delays or denials in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues and reputational harm any of which would adversely affect our business see item 1 “business  government regulation of our operations” for more details

management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is intended to assist the reader in understanding and assessing significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of our consolidated company this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k certain statements in this item 7 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k constitute forwardlooking statements various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in forwardlooking statements and item 1a “risk factors” may cause our actual results financial position and cash generated from operations to differ materially from these forwardlooking statements 

executive overview 

this section provides an overview of our financial results recent product and latestage pipeline developments and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry earnings per share eps data are presented on a diluted basis 

covid19 pandemic 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have been focused on maintaining a reliable supply of our medicines reducing the strain on the medical system developing treatments for covid19 protecting the health safety and wellbeing of our employees supporting our communities and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines particularly insulin 

we have experienced negative impacts to our underlying business due to the covid19 pandemic including decreases in new prescriptions as a result of fewer patient visits to physician’s offices to begin or change treatment changes in payer segment mix and the use of patient affordability programs in the united states us due to rising unemployment additionally we have experienced and may continue to experience decreased demand as a result of lack of normal access and fewer inperson interactions by patients and our employees with the healthcare system in certain locations in the us and around the world with covid19 outbreaks we temporarily halted inperson interactions by our employees with healthcare providers and increased virtual interactions while inperson interactions have resumed in many locations we may decide to halt such activity in the future and in those cases expect to resume such interactions as it is safe to do so and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirements we may experience additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the covid19 pandemic on governmentfunded healthcare systems around the world 

we remain committed to discovering and developing new treatments for the patients we serve at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic we paused new clinical trial starts and enrollment in new trials in order to reduce the strain on the medical system and we have resumed this activity in our clinical trials however significant delays or unexpected issues such as higher discontinuation rates or delays accumulating data affecting the timing conduct or regulatory review of our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to commercialize some assets in our product pipeline if the covid19 pandemic continues for a protracted period 

in regards to covid19 therapies the us food and drug administration fda granted emergency use authorizations eua for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for higherrisk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mildtomoderate covid19 and for baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized covid19 patients we are actively working with a variety of organizations including governmental agencies to facilitate access to our covid19 treatments in various countries however we face unique risks and uncertainties in our development manufacture and uptake of potential treatments for covid19 including vulnerability to supply chain disruptions higher manufacturing costs difficulties in manufacturing sufficient quantities of our therapies restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies and risks related to handling return andor refund of product after delivery by us expedited authorization processes including our euas for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together have allowed restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety and efficacy data and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our covid19 therapies additionally the availability of superior or competitive therapies or preventative measures such as vaccines coupled with the transient nature of pandemics could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our covid19 therapies in addition we may be required to accept returns of certain product previously shipped pursuant to euas if the relevant eua is revoked or terminated mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus could also render our therapies ineffective any of these risks could prevent us from recouping our substantial investments in the research development and manufacture of our covid19 therapies 

our ability to continue to operate without significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain we have taken steps to protect our employees worldwide with particular measures in place for those working in our manufacturing sites and distribution facilities for 2020 we were able to largely maintain our normal operations however uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations global supply chain and distribution systems which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products and the ability of third parties on which we rely to fulfill their obligations to us and could increase our expenses 

although the covid19 pandemic has affected our operations and demand for our products it has not negatively impacted our liquidity position we expect to continue to generate cash flows to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and to have access to liquidity via the shortterm and longterm debt markets we also have not observed any material impairments of our assets or significant changes in the fair value of assets due to the covid19 pandemic 

the degree to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our business operations financial results and liquidity will depend on future developments is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted due to among other things the duration and severity of the pandemic the actions taken to reduce its transmission including widespread availability of vaccines and the speed with which and extent to which more stable economic and operating conditions resume should the covid19 pandemic and any associated recession or depression continue for a prolonged period our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows could be materially impacted by lower revenues and profitability and a lower likelihood of effectively and efficiently developing and launching new medicines see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information on risk factors that could impact our results 

elanco animal health elanco disposition 

on march 11 2019 we completed the disposition of our remaining 802 percent ownership of elanco common stock through a taxfree exchange offer as a result we recognized a gain on the disposition of approximately 37 billion in the first quarter of 2019 and now operate as a single segment see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

financial results 

the following table summarizes our key operating results 



nm  not meaningful 

revenue increased in 2020 driven by increased volume partially offset by lower realized prices operating expenses defined as the sum of research and development and marketing selling and administrative expenses increased in 2020 driven primarily by approximately 450 million of development expenses for covid19 therapies the decreases in net income and eps in 2020 were driven primarily by the approximately 37 billion gain recognized on the disposition of elanco in 2019 partially offset by higher gross margin and higher other income in 2020 

the following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2020 and 2019 financial results 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

latestage pipeline 

our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new medicines we currently have approximately 45 candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase 

the following new molecular entities nmes and diagnostic agent are currently in phase iii clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review or have received first regulatory approval in the us europe or japan in 2020 in addition the following table includes certain nmes currently in phase ii clinical trials the following table reflects the status of these nmes and diagnostic agent including certain other developments since january 1 2020 





1 in collaboration with almirall sa almirall in europe 

2 fast track designation is designated to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs 

3 in collaboration with pfizer inc 

4 continued approval may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory phase iii trials 

as part of our collaboration with innovent we plan to pursue registration of sintilimab injection tyvyt ®  in the us and other markets 

our pipeline also contains several new indication line extension nilex products the following certain nilex products are currently in phase ii or phase iii clinical testing have been submitted for regulatory review or have received first regulatory approval in the us europe or japan for use in the indication described in 2020 the following table reflects the status of certain nilex products including certain other developments since january 1 2020 



1 in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 

2 fast track designation is designated to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs 

3 breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of potential medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products as well as a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue cash flows and earnings 

our formulation patents for forteo ® expired in december 2018 and our use patents expired in august 2019 in major european markets and the us both the formulation patent and the use patent expired in august 2019 in japan we expect further volume decline as a result of the anticipated entry of generic and biosimilar competition following the loss of patent exclusivity in these markets in the aggregate we expect that the decline in revenue will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the alimta ® vitamin regimen patents which we expect to provide us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries and through may 2022 in the us have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions in the us most challenges have been finally resolved in our favor and one remains in active litigation we and eagle pharmaceuticals inc eagle reached an agreement in december 2019 to settle all pending litigation allowing eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting february 2022 up to an approximate threeweek supply and subsequent unlimited entry starting april 2022 we expect that the entry of generic competition in the us either from an unfavorable outcome to the patent challenge or following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

we are aware that several companies have received approval to market generic versions of pemetrexed in major european markets and that generic competitors may choose to attempt a launch at risk following a final decision in the supreme court of germany in july 2020 overturning the lower court and upholding the validity of our alimta patent several generics that were on the market at risk in germany left we have removed the remaining generics from the market in germany by obtaining preliminary injunctions in our favor in september 2020 the paris court of first instance in france issued a final decision upholding the validity of our alimta patent and found infringement by fresenius kabi france and fresenius kabi groupe france’s collectively kabi pemetrexed product the court issued an injunction against kabi and provisionally awarded us damages in january 2021 that same court issued a preliminary injunction against zentiva france sas zentiva the last remaining company with a generic pemetrexed product on the french market and provisionally awarded us damages in october 2020 the court of appeal of the netherlands overturned a lower court decision and ruled that our alimta patent is valid and infringed and reinstated an injunction against kabi thereby removing kabis pemetrexed product from the netherlands market kabi has appealed this decision to the netherlands supreme court kabis generic pemetrexed product was the only at risk generic on the market in the netherlands our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdictions 

we expect that further entry of generic competition for alimta in major european markets following either the loss of effective patent protection or of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending in the us europe and japan regarding among others our alimta patents 

the compound patent for humalog ® insulin lispro has expired in major markets global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro a competitor launched a similar version of insulin lispro in certain european markets in 2017 and in the us in the second quarter of 2018 while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time 

our compound patent protection for cymbalta ® expired in japan in january 2020 we expect generics to enter the market in mid2021 we expect that the entry of generic competition will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue and will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and japanese yen while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates fluctuations in these rates could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

us 

in the us public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other cost control measures may be enacted to manage federal and state budgets key health policy initiatives affecting biopharmaceuticals include 

• the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act and subsequent stimulus bills that focus on ensuring availability and access to lifesaving drugs during a public health crisis 

• foreign reference pricing in medicare and private insurance 

• modifications to medicare parts b and d 

• provisions that would allow the department of health and human services hhs to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in medicare 

• a reduction in biologic data exclusivity 

• proposals related to medicaid prescription drug coverage and manufacturer drug rebates 

• proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information and 

• statelevel proposals related to prescription drug prices and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs 

on july 24 2020 and september 13 2020 former us president donald trump signed executive orders related to the 340b prescription drug program rebate reform in medicare part d drug importation including insulin and foreign reference pricing in medicare part b and part d although their current status is unclear given the change in presidential administration these executive orders if implemented could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position on september 1 2020 lilly announced it would distribute all 340b ceiling priced products directly to covered entities and their child sites only lilly provides 340b discounts to a contract pharmacy only if it is a wholly owned subsidiary of a covered entity if a covered entity does not have an inhouse pharmacy or in the case of insulin if the subject covered entity and its contract pharmacies agree to pass along the discount to patients without any markup for dispensing fees and without billing insurance or collecting duplicate discounts lilly has been transparent with regulators on its distribution activity and continues to comply with all 340b program requirements certain covered entities and their trade associations have threatened litigation questioning whether lilly’s program and similar actions by other manufacturers violate 340b program requirements on october 9 2020 three covered entities sued hhs and the health resources and services administration hrsa in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking to compel the agencies to take enforcement action against lilly and three other companies among other requested relief on october 21 2020 a trade association representing certain covered entities sued hhs in the same court seeking to compel the agency to promulgate administrative dispute resolution regulations on december 11 2020 a number of associations and entities filed suit against hhs in the us district court for the northern district of california requesting immediate enforcement of the contract pharmacy guidance on december 31 2020 the general counsel of hhs issued an advisory opinion alleging that honoring contract pharmacy agreements is mandatory in january 2021 lilly filed suit against hhs the secretary of hhs the hrsa and the administrator of the hrsa in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a declaratory judgment that hhss attempt to require manufacturers to permit contract pharmacy distribution is unlawful and a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the alternative dispute resolution process created by defendants and with it their application of the advisory opinion and other related relief the cases are pending and the impact of these cases and any subsequent litigation is uncertain see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

california and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business several states have also passed importation legislation including colorado florida maine new hampshire new mexico and vermont as of late 2020 several of these states were actively working with the former presidential administration to implement an importation program from canada on november 22 2020 florida announced it submitted a proposed importation plan to the us in 2020 hhs and the fda also took several actions to advance state importation initiatives including issuing requests for proposals for personal importation and reimportation of insulin and a final rule on the importation of prescription drugs additionally on november 27 2020 the canadian minister of health issued an interim order to ensure that participation in bulk importation frameworks such as the one recently established by the us does not cause or exacerbate a drug shortage in canada we continue to review these state proposals and legislation as well as federal rules and guidance published by hhs and the fda the impact of which is uncertain at this time currently it is unclear if the current presidential administration will adopt any of the importation initiatives put forth by the former presidential administration we will continue to monitor and assess these developments 

in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals health plans pharmacy benefit managers wholesalers and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance private thirdparty insurers as well as governments typically maintain formularies that specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates valuebased agreements where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcomes are another tool that may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable we expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations in addition to formulary placement changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer costsharing through high deductible plans and higher coinsurance or copays we continue to invest in patient affordability solutions resulting in lower revenue in an effort to assist patients in affording their medicines 

the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid a trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high outofpocket costs for patients particularly for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time federal legislation litigation or administrative actions to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the aca could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performancebased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges as additional reforms are finalized we will assess their impact on future revenues in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded pharmaceutical products the covid19 pandemic is also creating additional pressure on health systems worldwide as a result cost containment and other measures may intensify as governments manage and emerge from the pandemic 

tax matters 

we are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions therefore changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations could affect our effective tax rate results of operations and cash flows countries around the world including the us are actively considering and enacting tax law changes the current presidential administrations tax proposal contains significant changes including the rate at which income of us companies would be taxed further actions taken with respect to taxrelated matters by associations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development and the european commission could influence tax policy in countries in which we operate in addition global tax authorities routinely examine our tax returns and are expected to become more aggressive in their examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions which could affect our anticipated tax liabilities 

acquisitions 

we strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including acquisitions strategic alliances collaborations investments and licensing arrangements we view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies as we seek to bolster our pipeline and enhance shareholder value we continuously evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business 

in 2019 we acquired all shares of loxo for a purchase price of 692 billion net of cash acquired under the terms of the agreement we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines including selpercatinib an oral ret inhibitor and loxo305 an oral btk inhibitor in the second quarter of 2020 the fda approved selpercatinib retevmo under its accelerated approval regulations and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials 

in 2020 we acquired all shares of dermira for a purchase price of 8493 million net of cash acquired under terms of the agreement we acquired lebrikizumab a novel investigational monoclonal antibody being evaluated for the treatment of moderatetosevere atopic dermatitis lebrikizumab was granted fast track designation from the fda we also acquired qbrexza ® cloth a medicated cloth for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating 

in january 2021 we acquired all shares of prevail therapeutics inc prevail for a purchase price of approximately 880 million in cash plus one nontradable contingent value right cvr the cvr entitles prevail stockholders to up to an additional approximately 160 million payable subject to certain terms and conditions upon the first regulatory approval of a prevail product in one of the following countries us japan united kingdom germany france italy or spain under the terms of the agreement we acquired a biotechnology company developing potentially diseasemodifying aav9based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases

the following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year 



numbers may not add due to rounding 

in the us the revenue increase in 2020 was driven by increased volume primarily for trulicity ®  bamlanivimab and taltz ®  excluding bamlanivimab revenue us revenue grew 5 percent the increase in revenue due to volume was partially offset by a decrease in realized prices the decrease in realized prices in the us was primarily driven by increased rebates to gain and maintain broad commercial access across the portfolio and to a lesser extent unfavorable segment mix and changes to estimates for rebates and discounts most notably impacting humalog the decrease in realized prices in the us was partially offset by modest list price increases and lower utilization in the 340b segment 

outside the us the revenue increase in 2020 was driven by increased volume primarily for tyvyt trulicity alimta and olumiant the increase in revenue due to volume was partially offset by lower realized prices primarily for tyvyt and alimta the increase in volume and decrease in realized prices for tyvyt and alimta was driven primarily by their inclusion in government reimbursement programs in china

1 humalog revenue includes insulin lispro 

2 jardiance revenue includes glyxambi ®  synjardy ®  and trijardy ® xr 

3 bamlanivimab sales are pursuant to eua 

4 trajenta revenue includes jentadueto ®  

revenue of trulicity a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors increased 22 percent in the us driven by increased volume partially offset by lower realized prices primarily due to higher contracted rebates revenue outside the us increased 27 percent primarily driven by increased volume 

revenue of humalog an injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes decreased 11 percent in the us driven by lower realized prices partially offset by higher demand revenue outside the us decreased 1 percent primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates included in the revenue of humalog in the us are our own insulin lispro authorized generics which began launching in the second quarter of 2019 in order to lower outofpocket costs for patients while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid severe decline in revenue however due to the impact of competition and due to pricing pressure in the us and some international markets we expect some price decline and loss of market share to continue over time 

revenue of alimta a treatment for various cancers increased 4 percent in the us primarily driven by higher realized prices revenue outside the us increased 19 percent primarily driven by increased volume in china and germany partially offset by lower realized prices we will lose our patent protection for alimta in japan and major european countries in june 2021 we expect the limited entry of generic competition in the us starting february 2022 and subsequent unlimited entry starting april 2022 we expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue see results of operations  executive overview  other matters for more information 

revenue of taltz a treatment for moderatetosevere plaque psoriasis active psoriatic arthritis ankylosing spondylitis and active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis increased 27 percent in the us primarily driven by increased demand revenue outside the us increased 43 percent primarily driven by increased volume 

revenue of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes decreased 2 percent in the us driven by lower realized prices partially offset by higher volume revenue outside the us decreased 4 percent driven by decreased volume and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by higher realized prices 

revenue of jardiance a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease increased 10 percent in the us driven by increased volume revenue outside the us increased 41 percent driven primarily by increased volume see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim involving jardiance 

revenue of basaglar a longacting human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes decreased 4 percent in the us driven by lower realized prices revenue outside the us increased 19 percent driven primarily by increased volume see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim involving basaglar a competitor launched a similar version of glargine in the us in 2020 due to the impact of competitive pressures we expect some price decline and loss of market share over time 

revenue of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women decreased 21 percent in the us primarily driven by decreased demand revenue outside the us decreased 29 percent driven by decreased volume and to a lesser extent lower realized prices we expect further volume declines as a result of the anticipated entry of generic and biosimilar competition due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the us japan and major european markets see executive overview  other matters  patent matters for more information 

revenue of cyramza a treatment for various cancers increased 14 percent in the us driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher realized prices revenue outside the us increased 10 percent driven primarily by increased volume 

revenue of verzenio a treatment for hr her2 metastatic breast cancer increased 36 percent in the us driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher realized prices revenue outside the us increased 1695 million driven by higher volume 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of revenue was 777 percent in 2020 a decrease of 11 percentage points compared with 2019 primarily due to the impact of lower realized prices on revenue the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and higher intangibles amortization expense related to retevmo partially offset by charges in 2019 resulting from the withdrawal of lartruvo ® and greater manufacturing efficiencies gross margin percent for 2020 was also negatively impacted as a result of bamlanivimab sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 

research and development expenses increased 9 percent to 609 billion in 2020 driven primarily by approximately 450 million of development expenses for covid19 therapies excluding these expenses related to covid19 therapies research and development expenses were relatively flat 

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent to 612 billion in 2020 primarily due to lower marketing activity 

we recognized acquired iprd charges of 6604 million in 2020 resulting from the acquisitions of disarm and a preclinical stage company as well as collaborations with innovent sitryx fochon abcellera evox and junshi biosciences in 2019 we recognized acquired iprd charges of 2396 million resulting from collaborations with ac immune centrexion immunext and avidity 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 1312 million in 2020 the charges were primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure as well as acquisition and integration costs incurred as part of the acquisition of dermira in 2019 we recognized 5756 million of asset impairment restructuring and other special charges primarily associated with the accelerated vesting of loxo employee equity awards as part of the acquisition of loxo 

other—net income expense was income of 117 billion in 2020 compared to income of 2916 million in 2019 primarily driven by higher net gains on investment securities 

our effective tax rate was 143 percent in 2020 compared with an effective tax rate of 119 percent in 2019 driven by net discrete tax benefits in 2019 

operating results—2019 

for a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2019 and 2018 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our available cash and cash equivalents together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to shortterm and longterm borrowings are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements which include 

• working capital requirements including related to employee payroll clinical trials manufacturing materials and taxes 

• capital expenditures 

• share repurchases and dividends 

• repayment of outstanding shortterm and longterm borrowings 

• contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 

• milestone and royalty payments and 

• potential business development activities including acquisitions strategic alliances collaborations investments and licensing arrangements 

our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources including our access to external capital to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements as of december 31 2020 our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations capital equipment expenditures dividends repayment of outstanding borrowings the remaining obligations for the onetime repatriation transition tax also known as the toll tax from the tax cuts and jobs act 2017 tax act leases unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds and retirement benefits see notes 11 14 10 7 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements we anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues 

cash and cash equivalents increased to 366 billion as of december 31 2020 compared with 234 billion at december 31 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 650 billion in 2020 compared with 484 billion in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included approximately 360 million of cash paid to settle the accelerated vesting of loxo employee equity awards see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

in addition to our cash and cash equivalents we held total investments of 299 billion and 206 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

in february 2020 we completed our acquisition of dermira for 1875 per share or approximately 11 billion which was funded through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper in february 2019 we completed our acquisition of loxo for 235 per share or approximately 69 billion which was funded through a mixture of cash and debt see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of december 31 2020 total debt was 1660 billion an increase of 128 billion compared with 1532 billion at december 31 2019 the increase primarily related to the net proceeds from the issuance of 100 billion of 225 percent fixedrate notes in may 2020 as well as the net proceeds from the issuance of an additional 2500 million of 225 percent fixedrate notes and the issuance of 8500 million of 250 percent fixedrate notes in august 2020 we used the net proceeds from the sale of these notes for general corporate purposes which included the repayment of outstanding commercial paper used to fund a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of dermira see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of december 31 2020 we had a total of 524 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 500 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any shortterm borrowing needs 

for the 135 th consecutive year we distributed dividends to our shareholders dividends of 296 per share and 258 per share were paid in 2020 and 2019 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2020 effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2021 the quarterly dividend was increased to 085 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2021 of 340 per share 

capital expenditures of 139 billion during 2020 compared to 103 billion in 2019 

in 2020 we repurchased 5000 million of shares under our 800 billion share repurchase program authorized in june 2018 as of december 31 2020 we had 100 billion remaining under this program see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

on march 11 2019 we completed the disposition of our remaining 802 percent ownership of elanco common stock through a taxfree exchange offer which resulted in a reduction in shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 65 million as of that date 

in january 2021 we completed our acquisition of prevail for 2250 per share or approximately 880 million in cash plus one nontradable cvr that entitles prevail stockholders to up to an additional 400 per share in cash or an aggregate of approximately 160 million payable subject to certain terms and conditions this acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates currency values and fair values of equity securities these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2020 and 2019 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and japanese yen we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro and the japanese yen our corporate riskmanagement policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2020 and 2019 would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our carrying values of these investments were 204 billion and 112 billion respectively a hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted othernet income expense by 4076 million and 2247 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 

individually these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows respectively in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts product sales to customers net product revenue and collaborations and other arrangements for product sales to customers provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts significant judgments are required in making these estimates the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care medicare medicaid and chargeback contracts in the us in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries and product launches an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs and our product pricing 

refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration as well as royalties upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts 

financial statement impact 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate 313 million effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was approximately 90 percent as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us sales return rebate and discount liability balances including managed care medicare medicaid chargebacks and patient assistance programs 



1 adjustments of the estimates for these returns rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 2 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

background and uncertainties 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we consider any thirdparty indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated with respect to our thirdparty indemnification rights these considerations include the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

acquisitions 

background and uncertainties 

to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition we make certain judgments which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules 

if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets where applicable is recorded as goodwill if the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and therefore any acquired iprd that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as well as estimated asset lives can materially affect our consolidated results of operations the fair values of intangible assets including acquired iprd are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management significant estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to probability of technical success revenue growth and discount rate depending on the facts and circumstances we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities 

the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

background and uncertainties 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in “results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary materially from these estimates 

retirement benefits assumptions 

background and uncertainties 

defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate expected return on plan assets and retirement age these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected return on plan assets we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 65 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

annually we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans approximately 35 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equitylike investment funds collectively alternative assets we value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty adjusted as necessary inputs include underlying net asset values discounted cash flows valuations comparable market valuations and adjustments for currency credit liquidity and other risks

if the 2020 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 216 million if the 2020 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 288 million if our assumption regarding the 2020 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 520 million the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 75 percent and 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets respectively at december 31 2020 

adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur such changes are deferred along with other actuarial gains and losses and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees 

income taxes 

background and uncertainties 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based upon these interpretations our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by various taxing authorities which could result in future tax interest and penalty assessments inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law the issuance of regulations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of a tax examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2020 a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 834 million and 408 million respectively

financial expectations for 2021 

for the full year of 2021 we expect eps to be in the range of 710 to 775 which excludes estimated acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of prevail we anticipate total revenue between 265 billion and 280 billion including an estimated 1 billion to 2 billion of revenue from covid19 therapies revenue growth is expected to be driven by volume from trulicity taltz verzenio jardiance olumiant cyramza emgality tyvyt and retevmo as well as by covid19 therapies revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by lower revenue for products that have lost patent exclusivity we expect midsingle digit net price declines globally in 2021 in the us we expect lowtomidsingle digit net price declines driven primarily by increased rebates to maintain broad commercial access and segment mix partially offset by lower utilization in the 340b segment outside the us we expect net price declines in china japan and europe 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 77 percent in 2021 research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of 65 billion to 67 billion including approximately 300 million to 400 million of continued investment in covid19 therapies marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 62 billion to 64 billion other—net income expense is expected to be expense in the range of 200 million to 300 million the 2021 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 15 percent

business 

tableend eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” or lilly was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and market products in a single business segment—human pharmaceutical products 

our purpose is to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover or acquire develop and bring to market innovative new medicines 

in september 2018 elanco animal health incorporated elanco an animal health business previously wholly owned by the company completed an initial public offering of its common stock which trades on the new york stock exchange and in march 2019 we completed the disposition of our remaining ownership of elanco common stock for more information on the exchange offer see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview”

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs 

us 

in the us most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies physicians and other health care professionals and hospitals in 2019  2018  and 2017  three wholesale distributors in the us  mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc  each accounted for between 14 percent and 21 percent of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we also promote to healthcare providers in medical journals and online health care channels distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our own resources 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations group purchasing organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

outside the us 

outside the us we promote our products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and online health care channels while the products marketed vary from country to country diabetes and other endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in consolidated revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

marketing collaborations 

certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

competition 

our products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets 

important competitive factors include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will be or become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and europe the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturers generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products 

biosimilars 

several of our current products including cyramza emgality erbitux taltz and trulicity and many of the new molecular entities nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to its functional and structural similarity to the innovator biologic is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic globally most governments have developed regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovatordeveloped biologics but the patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for 

nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro which competes with our product humalog on the other hand with our partner boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar a new insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a followon biologic in the us and as a biosimilar in europe and japan in march 2020 the us regulatory status of all of our insulin products will transition to become regulated as “biologics” rather than “drugs” based on recent us food and drug administration fda draft guidance this change may lower the requirements for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at us pharmacies 

us private sector dynamics 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance for example in 2018 cvs health a large pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy chain acquired aetna a large national insurer and cigna corporation acquired express scripts in a similar transaction more recently in december 2019 express scripts signed a threeyear partnership agreement with another pharmacy benefit manager prime therapeutics 

payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates valuebased agreements where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcomes are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures are expected to continue to negatively affect our future consolidated results of operations 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section below in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 



process a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the fda to review an application there is a fiveyear cap on any restoration and no patents expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from fda approval some countries outside the us also offer forms of patent term restoration for example supplementary protection certificates are available to extend the life of a european patent up to an additional five years subject to a 15year cap from european medicines agency ema approval similarly in japan south korea and australia patent terms can be extended up to five years depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors 

loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals especially for nonbiologic products typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic biosimilar or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on manufacturing processes methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement thus some types of patents such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules are not available in certain developing countries further many developing countries and some developed countries do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trips 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes uses and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations in addition to the data protection and patents identified below we may hold patents on manufacturing processes formulations devices or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our topselling or recently launched patentprotected marketed products are as follows 

 outside the us important patent protection or data protection includes 

 baqsimi has been submitted for regulatory review in japan where it is expected to be protected by data protection upon approval 6 years 

flortaucipir has been submitted for regulatory review in the us for use as a positron emission tomography pet imaging agent and is protected by a compound patent 2029 not including possible patent extension 

selpercatinib has been submitted for regulatory review in the us for the treatment of cancers in certain patients and is protected by a us compound patent 2037 not including possible patent extension 

tanezumab has been submitted for regulatory review in the us for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain and is expected to be protected by data protection upon approval 12 years 

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks for names and unique product appearance eg the appearance of our trulicity autoinjector which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms trademark protection often extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product 

patent licenses 

most of our major products are not subject to significant license agreements for information on our license and collaboration agreement with incyte corporation related to olumiant see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations 

patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biologics when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the new drug application ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after certain of the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more or all of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” if the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in hatchwaxman litigation involving alimta with five generic manufacturers for more information on hatchwaxman litigation involving the company see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies” and item 3 legal proceedings 

under the bpci act the fda cannot approve a biosimilar application until data protection expires 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic however the bpci act does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator’s patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic the patent litigation scheme under the bpci act is complex and courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in it patent holders still have the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration 

in addition there is a procedure in us patent law known as inter partes review ipr which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued us patent for validity iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the ipr process in attempts to invalidate our patents 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us for more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our alimta patents in europe and japan see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies” 

government regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major markets we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance to our business is the fda in the us pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the ema in europe and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years state and federal governments have increased their oversight enforcement activities and intraagency coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies several claims brought by these agencies against us and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions including china brazil and the united kingdom uk have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

we are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus 43 percent formula additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs since 2019 the bipartisan budget act has required manufacturers of brandname drugs biologics and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage up from the previous 50percent discount 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class 

in 2019 the white house signed into law targeted amendments to the medicaid drug rebate program statute as well as the fair and accurate medicaid pricing act which was part of the continuing appropriations act we do not believe either will have a material impact to our business several states have passed importation legislation including colorado florida maine and vermont specifically the state of florida is working with the administration to implement an importation program from canada as early as 2020 we are currently reviewing the state legislation as well as corresponding proposed federal rulemaking and guidance recently published by the department of health and human services and the fda the impact of which is uncertain at this time 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes in addition third party organizations including professional associations academic institutions and nonprofit entities associated with payers are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and costbenefit analyses on medicines the impact of which are uncertain at this time 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2019  we employed approximately 7810 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel 

our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of oncology diabetes neurodegeneration immunology and pain we believe that we have a strong biotechnology research program with more than half of our clinicalstage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our pharmaceutical products we actively invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the rate of innovation cycles leading to medical improvements over initial inventions is accelerating which has increased the risk that we opt not to develop a latestage asset or that new products fail to achieve commercial success due to technical obsolescence  displacement by followon competitor products  before the period of exclusivity has ended after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect data and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics consistent with their purpose these studies have the potential to identify information about problems with product safety or efficacy that result in product withdrawal the following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

 the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological targets that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become candidate molecules and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one candidate molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low 

 the early development phase involves refining candidate molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals as necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans in general the first human tests often referred to as phase i are conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose range has been established the drug is typically administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or biomarkers of the disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase approximately 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase can take several years to complete 

 product phase phase iii molecules have met initial safety requirements and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

 once a molecule is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 45 drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapies for various cancers alzheimer’s disease pain migraine cluster headache diabetes obesity and autoimmune diseases including alopecia areata systemic lupus erythematosus psoriasis atopic dermatitis crohns disease and ulcerative colitis we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development in our chosen priority areas we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the us ireland and puerto rico finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that is intended to allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems inventory management and backup sites 

however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience unplanned plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities significant failure of a contract supplier or significant unanticipated increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly internal standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination thereof additional assurance of quality is provided by corporate qualityassurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at thirdparty suppliers

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks certain of these risks could also adversely affect the companys reputation 

 there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial position see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline” for more details 

 a number of our topselling products have recently lost or will lose in the next several years significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as key countries outside the us as illustrated in the tables below 



certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiologic products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues especially in the us historically outside the us the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the us however generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the us including japan europe and many countries in the emerging markets for biologics such as humalog humulin erbitux cyramza trulicity taltz and emgality loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to many factors including development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters” and item 1 business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

 our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time depending on local laws and regulations changes to such laws and regulations could reduce protections for our innovative products in the us in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the bpci act which applies to our biologic products the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld in addition a separate ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatchwaxman act our patents may be invalidated via this review process although such a decision can be appealed to the courts in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market while a win provides no precedential value  the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” item 3 legal proceedings and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies for more details 

 public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medications these pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income 

we expect pricing reimbursement and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the us to become more severe for more details see item 1 “business  regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” 

 we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world particularly for biosimilars changes to such regulations could make it easier less expensive and less time consuming for competitor products to enter the market some of which could be substituted for our products at the pharmacy our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs see item 1 “business  competition” and business  research and development for more details 

 as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  financial condition” for more details 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the course of our business we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events including the separation of elanco changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations as well as events that differ from our expectations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising the us tax law effective january 2018 and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes modifications to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  tax matters” and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 14 income taxes for more details lilly has taken the position on the separation from elanco based on an opinion of tax counsel that the divestiture of elanco common stock qualifies as a transaction that is taxfree for us federal income tax purposes if any facts assumptions representations and undertakings from lilly and elanco regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied the divestiture may not qualify for taxfree treatment which could result in significant us federal income tax liabilities for both lilly and its shareholders who exchanged their stock for elanco stock 

 a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our business partners is stored in our information systems networks and facilities or those of third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property clinical trial information corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information collectively “confidential information” we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems infrastructure and hardware together “it systems” some of which are within the company’s control and some of which are within the control of third parties to accumulate process store and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy data protection and data security maintaining the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business 

it systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources cyberattacks are growing in their frequency sophistication  and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect mitigate or prevent cyberattacks come in many forms including the deployment of harmful malware exploitation of vulnerabilities denialofservice attacks the use of social engineering  and other means to compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems  confidential information and other data breaches resulting in the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services can occur in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information or wrongful conduct by hackers competitors certain governments or other current or former company personnel our third party partners face similar risks  

the failure or inadequacy of our it systems the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems damage our operations customer relationships or reputation and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company 

to date system inadequacies operating failures unauthorized access service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks and the compromise disruption degradation manipulation loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our it systems we continue to implement measures in an effort to protect detect respond to and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our it systems however these measures may not be successful if they are not successful any of these events could result in material financial legal business or reputational harm to our business 

 while pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products affecting our sales volume declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners similarly in the event of a significant economic downturn we could have difficulty accessing credit markets 

significant portions of our business are conducted in europe including the uk asia and other international geographies trade disputes and interruptions in international relationships including pandemic diseases such as the coronavirus could result in changes to regulations governing our products and our intellectual property or otherwise affect our ability to do business while we do not expect either circumstance to materially affect our business in a direct manner these and similar events could adversely affect us or our business partners or customers 

 pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims 

 we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos ®  axiron ®  byetta ®  cialis and cymbalta among other products as well as litigation and investigations related to the pricing of our products see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 16 contingencies” and item 3 “legal proceedings” for more information on our current product liability litigation as well as pricing litigation investigations and inquiries because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products or to further litigation or investigations into pricing or other commercial practices such matters require substantial expenditures to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters 

 the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including us have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us we are and could in the future become subject to such investigations the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations and comparable foreign regulations for our products can lead to product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues see item 1 “business  government regulation of our operations” for more details 

 pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters or pandemic disease mechanical or information technology system vulnerabilities such as system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources or inability to obtain solesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products see item 1 “business  raw materials and product supply” for more details 

 we rely on third parties including suppliers distributors alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development manufacture commercialization support for information technology systems product distribution and certain financial transactional processes for example we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our confidential and proprietary information may experience disruption or fail to perform due to information technology system vulnerabilities breaches or cyberattacks or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality privacy security or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business

executive overview 

this section provides an overview of our financial results recent product and latestage pipeline developments and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry earnings per share eps data are presented on a diluted basis 

on march 11 2019 we completed the disposition of our remaining 802 percent ownership of elanco animal health incorporated elanco common stock through a taxfree exchange offer as a result we recognized a gain on the disposition of approximately 37 billion in the first quarter of 2019 and now operate as a single segment see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

financial results 

the following table summarizes our key operating results 

nm  not meaningful 

revenue increased in 2019 driven by increased volume partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates operating expenses increased in 2019  reflecting higher latestage development expenses and increased marketing expenses for recently launched products partially offset by lower marketing expenses for late lifecycle products the increases in net income and eps in 2019 were driven primarily by the gain recognized on the disposition of elanco and to a lesser extent lower acquired inprocess research and development iprd charges in addition to the increase in net income eps in 2019 significantly benefited from lower weightedaverage shares outstanding as a result of the elanco exchange offer and share repurchases

 the following table reflects the status of the recently approved products nmes and diagnostic agent set forth above as well as certain other developments to our latestage pipeline since january 1 2019  





1 the breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of potential medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint 

2 priority review is designed to expedite the review of potential medicines that if approved would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenue cash flows and earnings 

we lost our patent exclusivity for strattera ® in the us in may 2017 and generic versions of strattera were approved in the same month following a settlement related to the compound patent challenge for effient ®  generic products launched in the us in the third quarter of 2017 the entry of generic competition for these products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue which in the aggregate has had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

our compound patent protection for cialis ® tadalafil and adcirca ® tadalafil expired in major european markets and the us in november 2017 however in the us we were granted pediatric exclusivity through may 2018 another later expiring patent october 2020 was the subject of us patent litigation and pursuant to a settlement agreement related thereto generic tadalafil entered the us market in september 2018 we have faced and remain exposed to generic competition following the loss of exclusivity which has rapidly and severely eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue 

our formulation patents for forteo ® expired in december 2018 and our use patents expired in august 2019 in major european markets and the us both the formulation patent and the use patent expired in august 2019 in japan we expect further volume decline as a result of the entry of generic and biosimilar competition following the loss of patent exclusivity in these markets in the aggregate we expect that the decline in revenue will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the alimta ® vitamin regimen patents which we expect to provide us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries and through may 2022 in the us have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions in the us we and eagle pharmaceuticals inc eagle reached an agreement in december 2019 to settle all pending litigation allowing eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting february 2022 up to an approximate threeweek supply and subsequent unlimited entry starting april 2022 our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdictions our compound patent for alimta expired in the us in january 2017 and expired in major european countries and japan in december 2015 we are aware that several companies have received approval to market generic versions of pemetrexed in major european markets including germany france and the netherlands and that additional generic competitors may choose to launch at risk although we will continue to seek to remove any such products generic product entry is resulting in some loss in revenue in these jurisdictions we expect that further entry of generic competition for alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending in the us europe and japan regarding our alimta patents 

the compound patent for humalog ® insulin lispro has expired in major markets global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro a competitor launched a similar version of insulin lispro in certain european markets in 2017 and in the us in the second quarter of 2018 while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and japanese yen while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expense while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates fluctuations in these rates could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

us 

in the us public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other cost control measures may be enacted to manage federal and state budgets key health policy initiatives affecting biopharmaceuticals include 

 california and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business the bipartisan budget act enacted in february 2018 requires manufacturers of brandname drugs biologics and biosimilars to pay a 70 percent discount in the medicare part d coverage gap up from the previous 50 percent discount this increase in coverage gap discounts became effective at the beginning of 2019 in 2019 the white house signed into law targeted amendments to the medicaid drug rebate program statute as well as the fair and accurate medicaid pricing act which was part of the continuing appropriations act we do not believe these will have a material impact to our business several states passed importation legislation including colorado florida maine and vermont specifically the state of florida is working with the administration to implement an importation program from canada as early as 2020 we are currently reviewing the state legislation as well as corresponding proposed federal rulemaking and guidance recently published by the department of health and human services and the fda the impact of which is uncertain at this time 

in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals health plans pharmacy benefit managers wholesalers and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer larger entities increasingly through vertical integration thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy fewer side effects or greater patient ease of use but also by providing rebates valuebased agreements are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could continue to negatively affect future consolidated results of operations in addition to formulary placement changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost sharing through high deductible plans and higher coinsurance or copays including copay accumulator and maximizer programs we continue to invest in patient affordability solutions resulting in lower revenue in an effort to assist patients in affording their medicines 

the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid a trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high outofpocket costs for patients particularly for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time federal legislation litigation or administrative actions to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the aca could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performancebased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges as additional reforms are finalized we will assess their impact on future revenues in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products 

tax matters 

we are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions therefore changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate results of operations and cash flows countries around the world including the us actively consider and enact tax law changes further actions taken with respect to taxrelated matters by associations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development and the european commission could influence tax policy in countries in which we operate modifications to us and foreign tax laws or regulations are frequently enacted and could result in material impacts to our results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions 

we strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe to complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements collaborations and acquisitions we view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies as we seek to bolster our pipeline and enhance shareholder value we continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business 

in february 2019 we acquired all shares of loxo for a purchase price of 692 billion  net of cash acquired under the terms of the agreement we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines including selpercatinib loxo292 an oral ret inhibitor that has been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the fda and loxo305 an oral btk inhibitor 

on january 10 2020 we announced an agreement to acquire dermira inc for a purchase price of 1875 per share or approximately 11 billion the acquisition will expand our immunology pipeline with the addition of lebrikizumab a novel investigational monoclonal antibody designed to bind il13 with high affinity that is being evaluated in a phase iii clinical development program for the treatment of moderatetosevere atopic dermatitis lebrikizumab was granted fast track designation from the fda the fdas fast track designation is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needsthe acquisition will also expand our portfolio of marketed dermatology medicines with the addition of qbrexza ® glycopyrronium cloth a medicated cloth approved by the fda for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating the transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020 subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of dermiras common stock

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2019 and 2018 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and japanese yen we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro and the japanese yen our corporate riskmanagement policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2019 and 2018 would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows respectively in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments were as follows as of december 31 2019 

1 our longterm debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps we used the interest rate forward curve at december 31 2019  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 

2 we have included the following 

 3 the 2017 tax act provided an election to taxpayers subject to the toll tax to make payments over an eightyear period we made this election therefore we have included future toll tax payments accordingly 

4 we have included longterm liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and other postemployment benefit liabilities we excluded longterm income taxes payable of 120 billion because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 

the contractual obligations table is as of december 31 2019  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts product sales to customers net product revenue and collaborations and other arrangements for product sales to customers provisions for returns rebate and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts significant judgments are required in making these estimates the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care medicare medicaid and chargeback contracts in the us in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries and product launches an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs and our product pricing 

refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration as well as royalties upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts 

financial statement impact 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019  a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate 270 million effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was approximately 90 percent as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us sales return rebate and discount liability balances including managed care medicare and medicaid 



1 adjustments of the estimates for these returns rebates and discounts to actual results were approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

background and uncertainties 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we consider any thirdparty indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated with respect to our thirdparty indemnification rights these considerations include the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

acquisitions 

background and uncertainties 

to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition we make certain judgments which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules 

if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets where applicable is recorded as goodwill if the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and therefore any acquired iprd that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as well as estimated asset lives can materially affect our consolidated results of operations the fair values of intangible assets including acquired iprd are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management significant estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to probability of technical success revenue growth and discount rate depending on the facts and circumstances we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities 

the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

background and uncertainties 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in “results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary materially from these estimates 

retirement benefits assumptions 

background and uncertainties 

defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate expected return on plan assets and retirement age these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected return on plan assets we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

annually we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans approximately 40 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equitylike investment funds collectively alternative assets we value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty adjusted as necessary inputs include underlying net asset values discounted cash flows valuations comparable market valuations and adjustments for currency credit liquidity and other risks 

financial statement impact 

if the 2019 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 296 million  if the 2019 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 265 million  if our assumption regarding the 2019 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 459 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 75 percent and 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets respectively at december 31 2019  

adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur such changes are deferred along with other actuarial gains and losses and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees 

income taxes 

background and uncertainties 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law the issuance of regulations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of a tax examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2019  a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 765 million and 308 million  respectively

financial expectations for 2020 

for the full year of 2020  we expect eps to be in the range of 618 to 628 which includes the anticipated impact of the dermira acquisition we anticipate that total revenue will be between 237 billion and 242 billion revenue growth is expected to be driven by volume from trulicity taltz basaglar jardiance verzenio cyramza olumiant emgality baqsimi and the launch of reyvow revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by lower revenue for products that have lost patent exclusivity including the expected entry of generic competition for forteo in the us revenue growth is also expected to be partially offset by a lowsingle digit net price decline in the us driven primarily by rebates and legislated increases to medicare part d cost sharing patient affordability programs and net price declines in china japan and europe 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 79 percent in 2020  research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of 56 billion to 59 billion marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 62 billion to 64 billion other—net income expense is expected to be expense in the range of 100 million to 250 million 

the 2020 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 15 percent

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs 

human pharmaceuticals—us 

in the us most of our pharmaceutical products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies physicians and other health care professionals and hospitals in 2018  2017  and 2016  three wholesale distributors in the us  mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc  each accounted for between 11 percent  and 18 percent  of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major human pharmaceutical products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we also promote to healthcare providers in medical journals and online health care channels distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our own resources 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations group purchasing organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

human pharmaceuticals—outside the us 

outside the us we promote our human pharmaceutical products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and online health care channels while the products marketed vary from country to country endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in consolidated revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

human pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our human pharmaceutical products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the us and has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors and promotes its products primarily to producers and veterinarians for food animal products and to veterinarians for companion animal products elanco also advertises certain companion animal products directly to pet owners in markets where it is consistent with allowable promotional practices 

competition 

our human pharmaceutical products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors for both human pharmaceutical and animal health products include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective human pharmaceutical and animal health products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will be or become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturers 

generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic human pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products many of our animal health products also compete with generics 

biosimilars 

several of our current products including cyramza erbitux trulicity taltz and emgality and many of the new molecular entities nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to its functional and structural similarity to the innovator biologic is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic globally most governments have developed regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovatordeveloped biologics but the patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro which competes with our product humalog on the other hand with our partner boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar a new insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as the product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a followon biologic in the us and as a biosimilar in the eu and japan 

us private sector dynamics 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance for example in 2018 cvs health a large pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy chain acquired aetna a large national insurer and cigna corporation acquired express scripts in a similar transaction 

payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates valuebased agreements where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcomes are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could continue to negatively affect our future consolidated results of operations 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the 

us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section below in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceuticals typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on manufacturing processes methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 



outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceuticals varies widely and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners implementation of this agreement differs between developed and developing countries with many developing countries limiting protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement thus certain types of patents such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules are not available in many developing countries further many developing countries and some developed countries do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trips 

certain of our elanco animal health products are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection historically upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health products we have not generally experienced the rapid and severe declines in revenues that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes uses and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection for our topselling or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 

 outside the us important patent protection or data protection includes 



 nasal glucagon has been submitted for regulatory review in the us and is protected by delivery device patents latest expiring 2034 with data protection 35 years expected upon approval in europe nasal glucagon is protected by delivery device patents latest expiring 2034 with data protection 6 years expected upon approval 

lasmiditan has been submitted for regulatory review in the us and is protected by a compound patent 2025 not including possible patent extension 

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks for names and unique product appearance which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms trademark protection often extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product 

patent licenses 

most of our major products are not subject to significant license agreements for information on our license and collaboration agreement with incyte corporation related to olumiant see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations 

patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative human pharmaceuticals other than biologics without completion of safety and efficacy studies ie a complete new drug application nda by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after certain of the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative human pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers in hatchwaxman litigation involving alimta among other products for more information on hatchwaxman litigation involving the company see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” and item 3 legal proceedings 

under the bpci act the fda cannot approve a biosimilar application until data protection expires 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic however the bpci act does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator’s patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic the patent litigation scheme under the bpci act is complex and interpretation of the bpci act is currently the subject of ongoing litigation specifically courts have now held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the bpci act litigation scheme patent holders still have the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration 

in addition there is a procedure in us patent law known as inter partes review ipr which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued us patent iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court we are now seeing instances where generic drug companies and some investment firms are attempting to invalidate our patents by filing ipr challenges in the uspto for more information see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our alimta patents in europe and japan see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” 

government regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major markets we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulations address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal products the impact on humans who consume the food as well as the impact on the environment at the production site compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance to our business is the fda in the us pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical products and devices and certain animal health products in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals 

the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health products 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years state and federal governments have increased their oversight enforcement activities and intraagency coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies several claims brought by these agencies against us and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions including china brazil and the united kingdom uk have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

we are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our human pharmaceuticals under state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus 43 percent formula additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs beginning in 2019the bipartisan budget act requires manufacturers of brandname drugs biologics and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage up from the previous 50percent discount in january 2019 the department of health and human services released a proposed rule to reform the system of rebates paid to medicare part d plans medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers we are currently reviewing the proposed rule the impact of which is uncertain at this time 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class 

in may 2018 the white house released american patients first the trump administration blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce outofpocket costs blueprint the administration’s corresponding request for information included more than 30 proposed policy changes we believe the effect of certain of these proposals would be positive for our business while others would have negative consequences to our business the effect of these proposals and other proposals that extend beyond the blueprint will depend on the details and timing of the final legislation regulation or guidance and could lead to a wide range of outcomes some of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows at the state level in the us california nevada and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes in addition third party organizations including professional associations academic institutions and nonprofit entities associated with payers are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and costbenefit analyses on medicines the impact of which are uncertain at this time 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical products 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2018  we employed approximately 8500 people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel 

our internal human pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of oncology diabetes neurodegeneration immunology and pain we believe that we have a strong biotechnology research program with more than half of our clinicalstage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical products we actively invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technologies and potential products from internal and external sources to meet unmet veterinary food producer and pet owner needs our animal health scientists also leverage discoveries from our human health laboratories to develop products to enhance the health and wellbeing of farm animals and pets 

human pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the rate of innovation cycles leading to medical improvements over initial inventions is accelerating which has increased the risk that we opt not to develop a latestage asset or that new products fail to achieve commercial success due to technical obsolescence  displacement by followon competitor products  before the period of exclusivity has ended after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect data and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

 the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological targets that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become candidate molecules and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one candidate molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low 

 the early development phase involves refining candidate molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals as necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans in general the first human tests often referred to as phase i are conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose range has been established the drug is typically administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or biomarkers of the disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase approximately 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase can take several years to complete 

 product phase phase iii molecules have met initial safety requirements and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

 once a molecule is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 45  drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapies for various cancers alzheimer’s disease pain migraine diabetes severe hypoglycemia and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus psoriasis atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development in our chosen priority areas we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the us ireland and puerto rico finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that is intended to allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems inventory management and backup sites 

however human pharmaceutical and animal health production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly internal standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination thereof additional assurance of quality is provided by corporate qualityassurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to human pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at thirdparty suppliers

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks certain of these risks could also adversely affect the companys reputation 

 there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial position and prospects see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline” for more details 

 a number of our topselling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost or will lose in the next several years significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as key countries outside the us as illustrated in the tables below 





certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiologic products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues especially in the us historically outside the us the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the us however generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the us including japan europe and many countries in the emerging markets for biologics such as humalog humulin erbitux cyramza trulicity taltz and emgality loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters” and item 1 business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

 our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us in addition to the process for challenging patents which applies to our biologic products the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other human pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings and may not be upheld in addition a separate   ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatchwaxman act our patents may be invalidated via this review process although such a decision can be appealed to the courts in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market while a win provides no precedential value  the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” item 3 legal proceedings and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies for more details 

 public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for human pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medications these pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income 

we expect pricing reimbursement and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the us to become more severe for more details see item 1 “business  regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters  trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” 

 we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs see item 1 “business  competition” and business  research and development for more details 

 as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  financial condition” for more details 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising the us tax law effective january 2018 and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes modifications to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  executive overview  other matters” and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 13 income taxes for more details 

 a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our business partners is stored in our information systems networks and facilities or those of third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property clinical trial information corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information collectively “confidential information” we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems infrastructure and hardware together “it systems” some of which are within the company’s control and some of which are within the control of third parties to accumulate process store and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data maintaining the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business 

it systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources cyberattacks are growing in their frequency sophistication   and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect mitigate or prevent cyberattacks come in many forms including the deployment of harmful malware exploitation of vulnerabilities denialofservice attacks the use of social engineering   and other means to compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems   confidential information and other data breaches resulting in the compromise loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services can occur in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information or wrongful conduct by hackers competitors certain governments or other current or former company personnel our third party partners face similar risks  

the failure or inadequacy of our it systems the compromise loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems damage our operations customer relationships or reputation or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company 

to date system inadequacies operating failures unauthorized access service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks and the compromise loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we have implemented measures to protect detect respond to and minimize or prevent these risks however these measures may not be successful if they are not successful any of these events could result in material financial legal business or reputational harm to our business  

 while human pharmaceuticals and companion animal health products have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products affecting our sales volume our food animal business may be affected by depressed prices for our customers’ end products declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce human health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners similarly in the event of a significant economic downturn we could have difficulty accessing credit markets 

significant portions of our business are conducted in europe including the uk asia and other international geographies interruptions in international relationships such as the current negotiations between uk and the eu on the uk’s exit from the eu “brexit” and trade disputes such as the current trade negotiations between the us and china could result in changes to regulations governing our products and our intellectual property or otherwise affect our ability to do business while we do not expect either circumstance to materially affect our business in a direct manner these and similar events could adversely affect us or our business partners or customers 

 human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims 

 we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos ®  axiron ®  byetta ®  cialis and cymbalta among other products see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” and item 3 “legal proceedings” for more information on our current product liability litigation because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future which require substantial expenditures to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products 

 the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including us have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us we are and could in the future become subject to such investigations the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations and comparable foreign regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues see item 1 “business  government regulation of our operations” for more details 

 pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters mechanical or information technology system vulnerabilities such as system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources or inability to obtain solesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products see item 1 “business  raw materials and product supply” for more details 

 we rely on third parties including suppliers distributors alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development manufacture commercialization support for information technology systems product distribution and certain financial transactional processes for example we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 the animal health segment may be impacted by among other things emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets and failure of our research and development acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income   

 there are uncertainties and risks related to the timing and potential value to elanco lilly and our and their shareholders of the planned separation of the elanco animal health business including business industry and market risks as well as risks involving realizing the anticipated taxfree nature of the separation failure to implement the separation effectively could result in a lower value to lilly and to shareholders

 the following table reflects the status of the recently approved products nmes and diagnostic agent set forth above as well as certain other developments to our latestage pipeline since january 1 2018  





1 the fdas fast track designation is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs 

2 the breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of potential medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint 

3  priority review is designed to expedite the review of potential medicines that if approved would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

elanco animal health 

on september 24 2018 elanco animal health incorporated elanco a subsidiary completed its ipo of 723 million shares of its common stock which represents 198 percent of elancos outstanding shares at 24 per share in addition elanco completed a debt offering and entered into a term loan facility during the third quarter of 2018 see notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

we have announced our intent to divest our remaining 293290000  shares of elanco common stock through an exchange offer and on february 8 2019 elanco filed a registration statement on form s4 with the securities and exchange commission sec in the exchange offer our shareholders can exchange all some or none of their shares of our common stock for shares of elanco common stock owned by us subject to the specific terms and conditions of the offer described in elancos registration statement the completion of the exchange offer is subject to certain conditions including at least 146645000  shares of elanco common stock being distributed in exchange for shares of our common stock validly tendered in the exchange offer and the receipt of an opinion of counsel that the exchange offer will qualify for taxfree treatment to us and our participating shareholders however the conditions of the exchange offer may not be satisfied we may exchange less than our entire interest in elanco or we may decide to waive one or more of these conditions to the extent legally permissible and consummate the exchange offer even if all of the conditions are not satisfied if the exchange offer is not fully subscribed we intend from time to time to complete subsequent exchange offers andor pro rata spinoff of our remaining interest in elanco 

lartruvo 

in january 2019 we announced that we are suspending promotion of lartruvo because the announce study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival we are working with global regulators to determine the appropriate next steps we expect to incur a charge in the first quarter of 2019 related to the suspension of promotion for lartruvo the exact amount of the charge has not yet been determined but is estimated to be approximately 80 million pretax or approximately 013 per share after tax revenue related to lartruvo was 3047 million  in 2018 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenue cash flows and earnings 

we lost patent exclusivity for the bipolar mania indication for zyprexa ®  in japan in april 2016 generic versions of zyprexa launched in japan in june 2016 the loss of exclusivity for zyprexa in japan has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product 

we lost our patent exclusivity for strattera ®  in the us in may 2017 and generic versions of strattera were approved in the same month following a settlement related to the compound patent challenge for effient ®  generic products launched in the us in the third quarter of 2017 the entry of generic competition for these products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue which in the aggregate has had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

our compound patent protection for cialis ®  tadalafil and adcirca ®  tadalafil expired in major european markets and the us in november 2017 however in the us we were granted pediatric exclusivity through may 2018 pursuant to a settlement agreement related to our unit dose patent in the us generic tadalafil entered the us market in september 2018 we expect that the entry of additional generic competition into these markets following the loss of exclusivity will continue to cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

our formulation patents for forteo ® expired in december 2018 and use patents will expire in august 2019 in major european markets and the us both the formulation patent and the use patent expire in 2019 in japan while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of generic andor biosimilar competition in these markets we expect a rapid and severe decline in revenue in the us as a result of generic competition when the us patents expire outside the us we expect a decline in revenue following patent expirations however the decline may not be rapid and severe in the aggregate we expect that the decline in revenue will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the alimta ®  vitamin regimen patents which provide us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries and through may 2022 in the us have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdictions our compound patent for alimta expired in the us in january 2017 and expired in major european countries and japan in december 2015 we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending in the us europe and japan regarding our alimta patents 

the compound patent for humalog ®  insulin lispro has expired in major markets global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro a similar version of insulin lispro launched in the us in the second quarter of 2018 and in certain european markets in 2017 while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and japanese yen while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates fluctuations in these rates could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis including the significant deterioration of the bolívar resulted in a charge of 2039 million in 2016 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the charge as of december 31 2018 our venezuelan subsidiaries represented a de minimis  portion of our consolidated assets and liabilities we continue to monitor other deteriorating economies and it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

united states 

in the us public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other cost control measures may be enacted to manage federal and state budgets key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity modifications to medicare parts b and d language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in medicare proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information and statelevel proposals related to prescription drug prices and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs california and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business the bipartisan budget act enacted in february 2018 requires manufacturers of brandname drugs biologics and biosimilars to pay a 70 percent discount in the medicare part d coverage gap up from the previous 50 percent discount this increase in coverage gap discounts became effective at the beginning of 2019 we expect this increase in the coverage gap discounts to negatively impact our results of operations by approximately 200 million in 2019 in may 2018 the white house released american patients first the trump administration blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce outofpocket costs blueprint the administration’s corresponding request for information included more than 30 proposed policy changes we believe the effect of certain of these proposals would be positive for our business while others would have negative consequences to our business the effect of these proposals and those that extend beyond the blueprint will depend on the details and timing of the final legislation regulation or guidance and could lead to a wide range of outcomes some of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows in january 2019 the department of health and human services released a proposed rule to reform the system of rebates paid to medicare part d plans medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers we are currently reviewing the proposed rule the impact of which is uncertain at this time 

in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans pharmacy benefit managers wholesalers and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer larger entities increasingly through vertical integration thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy fewer side effects or greater patient ease of use but also by providing rebates valuebased agreements are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could continue to negatively affect future consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid a trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high outofpocket costs for patients particularly for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market driven in part by aca changes such as the 2022 implementation of the excise tax on employersponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit the socalled cadillac tax continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time federal legislation litigation or administrative actions to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the aca could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performancebased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges as additional reforms are finalized we will assess their impact on future revenues in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products 

tax matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us recently enacted tax reform legislation including the 2017 tax act significantly revising us tax law and other countries are actively considering or enacting tax law changes further organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development and the european commission are active regarding taxrelated matters which could influence international tax policy in countries in which we operate while outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain modifications to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

our accounting for the effects of the 2017 tax act signed into law in december 2017 is complete see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the 2017 tax act however we expect that additional guidance will be issued in 2019 which may materially affect our assumptions and estimates used to record our us federal and state income tax expense resulting from the 2017 tax act refer to “results of operations  financial condition” for discussion of the impact of the 2017 tax act on our liquidity 

acquisitions 

we strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe to complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements collaborations and acquisitions we view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies as we seek to bolster our pipeline and enhance shareholder value we continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business since january 1 2019 we have acquired loxo oncology inc loxo for a purchase price of 235  per share or approximately 8 billion  we also entered into a license and collaboration agreement with ac immune sa for an upfront fee of chf 800 million  and 500 million  in exchange for a note convertible to equity at a premium see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions of businesses and assets

revenue 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity by region 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

1 us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 

the following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

in the us the revenue increase in 2018  was driven by increased volume for newer pharmaceutical products including trulicity ®  basaglar ®  taltz ®  verzenio and jardiance ®  the increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume for products that have lost exclusivity including cialis effient and strattera as well as lower realized prices for several pharmaceutical products including trulicity basaglar forteo and taltz 

outside the us the revenue increase in 2018  was due to increased volume for several newer pharmaceutical products primarily driven by trulicity olumiant and taltz and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates the increase in revenue was partially offset by lower realized prices for several pharmaceutical products 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2018  compared with 2017

revenue of alimta a treatment for various cancers increased   9 percent  in the us driven by increased demand and higher realized prices revenue outside the us decreased   3 percent  driven by lower volume due to competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity in certain european countries including germany and lower realized prices partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates we have faced and remain exposed to generic entry in multiple countries which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue in those countries from current levels 

revenue of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia decreased   17 percent  in the us driven by decreased demand primarily due to the entry of generic tadalafil partially offset by higher realized prices revenue outside the us decreased   25 percent  driven by the loss of exclusivity in europe we lost our compound patent protection for cialis in major european markets in november 2017 and us exclusivity ended in late september 2018 see results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters for more information in addition to competition from generic tadalafil we also currently face competition from generic sildenafil which accelerated during 2018 we expect that the entry of generic competition due to the loss of exclusivity will continue to cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 738 percent  in 2018  an increase of 07  percentage points compared with 2017  primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower amortization expenses offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold the timing of manufacturing production and the negative impact of price on revenue

financial results 

the following table summarizes our key operating results 

nm  not meaningful 

revenue and gross margin increased in 2017 the increase in operating expense in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in marketing selling and administrative expense income before income taxes decreased in 2017 as higher asset impairment restructuring and other special charges acquired iprd charges and to a lesser extent higher operating expense were partially offset by a higher gross margin tax expense exceeded income before income taxes in 2017 as a result of the 2017 tax act resulting in a net loss for the year

in the us the revenue increase in 2017  was driven by increased volume for newer pharmaceutical products including trulicity taltz basaglar lartruvo and jardiance and higher realized prices for several pharmaceutical products primarily forteo and cialis as well as increased volume for companion animal products from the acquisition of boehringer ingelheim vetmedica incs us feline canine and rabies vaccine portfolio and other related assets bivivp the increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume due to loss of exclusivity for strattera and effient as well as decreased demand for cialis and food animal products cymbalta revenue declined as 2016 revenue benefited from reductions to the reserve for expected product returns of approximately 175 million 

outside the us the revenue increase in 2017  was due to increased volume for several new pharmaceutical products primarily driven by trulicity and cyramza the increase in revenue was partially offset by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity for alimta in several countries and lower volume from the loss of exclusivity for zyprexa in japan

revenue of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder decreased 47 percent in the us driven by the loss of exclusivity in the second quarter of 2017 partially offset by higher realized prices the entry of generic competition following the loss of effective patent protection has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue revenue outside the us increased 4 percent driven by increased volume in japan partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates primarily the japanese yen 

worldwide food animal revenue decreased 8 percent primarily driven by market access and competitive pressure in the us for posilac rbst and optaflexx ®  respectively worldwide companion animal revenue increased 10 percent driven by the inclusion of 2167 million in revenue from the acquisition of bivivp partially offset by competitive pressure

financial condition 

as of december 31 2018  cash and cash equivalents were 800 billion  an increase of 146 billion  compared with 654 billion  at december 31 2017  refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  

in addition to our cash and cash equivalents we held total investments of 211 billion  and 718 billion  as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

as of december 31 2018  total debt was 1277 billion  a decrease of 8762 million  compared with 1365 billion  at december 31 2017  the decrease was primarily due to the net decrease in the balance of commercial paper outstanding of 220 billion  and the repayment of 101 billion  of long term debt partially offset by the debt incurred by elanco as a result of a notes offering and entry into credit facilities totaling 248 billion  see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

excluding elanco at december 31 2018  we had a total of 542 billion  of unused committed bank credit facilities 500 billion  of which is available to support our commercial paper program see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details in january 2019 we entered into a 400 billion credit facility to support our commercial paper program we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowing needs 

in september 2018 elanco entered into a revolving credit agreement providing for a fiveyear 7500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september 2023 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

for the 133 rd  consecutive year we distributed dividends to our shareholders dividends of 225 per share and 208 per share were paid in 2018  and 2017  respectively in the fourth quarter of 2018  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2019  the quarterly dividend was increased to 0645 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2019  of 258 per share 

capital expenditures of 121 billion  during 2018  were 1338 million  more than in 2017  

in 2018  we repurchased 415 billion  of shares we completed the 500 billion  share repurchase program announced in october 2013 and the board authorized a new 800 billion  share repurchase program there were 210 billion  of shares repurchased under the 800 billion  program during 2018  see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details in january 2019 we initiated 350 billion of share repurchases that will conclude in the first half of 2019 these purchases are part of the 800 billion  program previously authorized by the board 

we have separately announced our intent to divest our remaining interest in elanco through an exchange offer in the exchange offer our shareholders can exchange all some or none of their shares of our common stock at a discount for shares of elanco common stock owned by us subject to the terms and conditions of the offer described in elancos registration statement filed with the sec on february 8 2019 

in february 2019 we completed our acquisition of loxo for 235  per share or approximately 8 billion  which will be funded through a mixture of cash and debt see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection 

pursuant to the 2017 tax act the us transitioned to a territorial tax system effective january 1 2018 therefore repatriations of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the us provides us with additional liquidity in the us without the requirement to pay us taxes as existed prior to the enactment of the new tax law we believe cash provided by operating activities along with available cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including installment payments of the toll tax dividends paid to shareholders share repurchases and capital expenditures 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we seek to address a 

portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2018  and 2017  including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and japanese yen we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro and the japanese yen our corporate riskmanagement policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2018  and 2017  would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to the results of operations or cash flows respectively in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows 

1 our longterm debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps we used the interest rate forward curve at december 31 2018  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 

2 we have included the following 

 3 the 2017 tax act provided an election to taxpayers subject to the toll tax to make payments over an eightyear period we made this election therefore we have included future toll tax payments accordingly 

4 we have included longterm liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and other postemployment benefit liabilities we excluded longterm income taxes payable of 105 billion because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2018  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts product sales to customers net product revenue and collaborations and other arrangements revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration as well as royalties upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

financial statement impact 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018  a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate   275 million  effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was approximately 90 percent as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us pharmaceutical sales return rebate and discount liability balances including managed care medicare and medicaid 



1 adjustments of the estimates for these returns rebates and discounts to actual results were approximately 1 percent  of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

background and uncertainties 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we also consider any thirdparty indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated with respect to our thirdparty indemnification rights these considerations include the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

background and uncertainties 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in “results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary materially from these estimates 

retirement benefits assumptions 

background and uncertainties 

defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate expected return on plan assets and retirement age these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected return on plan assets we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 70 percent  of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

financial statement impact 

if the 2018  discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 337 million  if the 2018  expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 256 million  if our assumption regarding the 2018  expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 491 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 75 percent  and 80 percent  of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets respectively at december 31 2018  

income taxes 

background and uncertainties 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of a tax examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

the 2017 tax act was enacted in december 2017 and introduced significant changes to the us corporate income tax system in accordance with gaap our accounting for the effects of the 2017 tax act is complete 

refer to results of operations  executive overview  other matters  tax matters and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the 2017 tax act subsequent to the enactment of the 2017 tax act numerous items of additional guidance were issued including notices proposed regulations and final regulations we expect that further guidance will be issued in 2019 which may change our interpretations of the new tax laws and co uld materially affect the estimates used to record us federal and state income tax expense 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2018  a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 745 million  and 298 million  respectively 

acquisitions 

background and uncertainties 

to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition we make certain judgments which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules 

if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets where applicable is recorded as goodwill if the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and therefore any acquired iprd that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as well as estimated asset lives can materially affect our consolidated results of operations the fair values of intangible assets including acquired iprd are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management depending on the facts and circumstances we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities 

the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities or a discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments including but not limited to revenue and the discount rate 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2018  a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of 371 million

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs 

human pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the us we distribute human pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2017  2016  and 2015  three wholesale distributors in the us  mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc  each accounted for between 9 percent  and 18 percent  of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major human pharmaceutical products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we also promote to healthcare providers in medical journals and online health care channels distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations group purchasing organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and 

certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

human pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the us we promote our human pharmaceutical products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and online health care channels while the products marketed vary from country to country endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in consolidated revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

human pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our human pharmaceutical products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the us and has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors elanco promotes its products primarily to producers and veterinarians for food animal products and to veterinarians for companion animal products elanco also advertises certain companion animal products directly to pet owners in markets where it is consistent with allowable promotional practices 

competition 

our human pharmaceutical products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors for both human pharmaceutical and animal health products include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective human pharmaceutical and animal health products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will be or become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturers generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic human pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products many of our animal health products also compete with generics 

biosimilars 

several of our current products including cyramza erbitux trulicity portrazza and taltz and many of the new molecular entities nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to its physical andor structural similarity to the original product is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the originator product globally governments have or are developing regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovatordeveloped biologics but the patent for the existing branded product must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro which will compete with our product humalog and other companies are in the process of developing similar products on the other hand with our partner boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar a new insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as the product currently marketed by a competitor this product has launched as a followon biologic in the us and as a biosimilar in the eu and japan 

us private sector dynamics 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance recently cvs health a large pharmaceutical benefit manager and pharmacy chain announced the planned acquisition of aetna a large national insurer 

payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect our future consolidated results of operations 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section below in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceuticals typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 



 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceuticals varies widely and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners implementation of this agreement differs between developed and developing countries with many developing countries limiting protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement thus certain types of patents such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules are not available in many developing countries further many developing countries and some developed countries do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trips 

certain of our elanco animal health products are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection historically upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health products we have not generally experienced the rapid and severe declines in revenues that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes uses and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection for our topselling or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 



 outside the us important patent protection or data protection includes 

 baricitinib olumiant has been submitted for regulatory review in the us and is protected by a compound patent in the us until 2030 not including possible patent extension galcanezumab has been submitted for regulatory review in the us and is protected by a compound patent 2033 additional information about this molecule is provided in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis  executive overview  latestage pipeline” 

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our major products are not subject to significant license agreements the compound patent for cialis is the subject of a license agreement with glaxosmithkline glaxo which assigns to us exclusively all rights in the compound the agreement calls for royalties of a singledigit percentage of net sales the agreement is not subject to termination by glaxo for any reason other than a material breach by lilly of the royalty obligation after a substantial cure period for information on our license and collaboration agreement with with incyte corporation related to olumiant see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 4 collaborations 

patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative human pharmaceuticals other than biologics without completion of safety and efficacy studies ie a complete new drug application nda by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative human pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers in hatchwaxman litigation involving forteo alimta and effient among other products for more information on hatchwaxman litigation involving the company see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” and item 3 legal proceedings 

under the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009   the bpci act the fda cannot approve a biosimilar application until data protection expires 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic however the act does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator’s patents as early as 4 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic the patent litigation scheme under the bpci act is complex and interpretation of the bpci act is currently the subject of ongoing litigation specifically courts have now held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the bpci act litigation scheme patent holders still have the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration 

in addition there is a procedure in us patent law known as ipr which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued us patent iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court we are now seeing instances where generic drug companies and some investment funds are attempting to invalidate our patents by filing ipr challenges in the uspto for more information see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our alimta patents in europe and japan see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” 

government regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulations address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal products the impact on humans who consume the food as well as the impact on the environment at the production site compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the us pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical products and certain animal health products in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the doj and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions including china brazil and the united kingdom uk have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our human pharmaceuticals under state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus 43 percent formula drug manufacturers are required to provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes in addition third party organizations including professional associations academic institutions and nonprofit entities associated with payers are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and costbenefit analyses on medicines the impact of which are uncertain at this time 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical products 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2017  we employed approximately 9000 people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel this number decreased to approximately 8200 as of january 31 2018 following a voluntary early retirement program in the us our research and development expenses were 528 billion  in 2017  524 billion  in 2016  and 480 billion  in 2015  

our internal human pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of cancer diabetes neurodegeneration immunology and pain we have a strong biotechnology research program with more than half of our clinicalstage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical products we actively invest in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technologies and potential products from internal and external sources to meet unmet veterinary food producer and pet owner needs our animal health scientists also leverage discoveries from our human health laboratories to develop products to enhance the health and wellbeing of farm animals and pets 

human pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the rate of innovation cycles leading to medical improvements over initial inventions is accelerating this has increased the risk that we opt not to develop a latestage asset or that new products fail to achieve commercial success due to technical obsolescence  displacement by followon competitor products  before the period of exclusivity has ended after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect data and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

 the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological targets that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become candidate molecules and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one candidate molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low 

 the early development phase involves refining candidate molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals as necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans in general the first human tests often referred to as phase i are conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose range has been established the drug is typically administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or biomarkers of the disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase approximately 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase can take several years to complete 

 product phase phase iii molecules have met initial safety requirements and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

 once a molecule is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 40  drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapies for various cancers alzheimer’s disease pain migraine rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis and severe hypoglycemia we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development in our chosen priority areas we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products see item 7 managements discussion and analysis  executive overview  latestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials primarily from only one source in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the us ireland and puerto rico finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems inventory management and backup sites 

however human pharmaceutical and animal health production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly internal standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination thereof additional assurance of quality is provided by corporate qualityassurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to human pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at thirdparty suppliers

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks certain of these risks could also adversely affect the companys reputation 

 there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash 

flows financial position and prospects see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  executive overview  latestage pipeline” for more details 

 a number of our topselling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost or will lose in the next several years significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as key countries outside the us as illustrated in the tables below 





certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiologic products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues especially in the us historically outside the us the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the us however generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the us including japan europe and many countries in the emerging markets for biologics such as humalog humulin erbitux cyramza trulicity and taltz loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  executive overview  other matters” and item 1 business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

 our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover develop and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us in addition to the process for challenging patents which applies to our biologic products the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other human pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings and may not be upheld in addition a separate   ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatchwaxman act as a result our patents may be invalided via this review process although such a decision can be appealed to the courts in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market while a win provides no precedential value  the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business  patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” item 3 legal proceedings and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies for more details 

 public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for human pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medications these pressures could negatively affect our future revenues and net income 

we expect pricing reimbursement and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the us to become more severe for more details see item 1 “business  regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  executive overview  other matters” 

 we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs see item 1 “business  competition” and business  research and development for more details 

 as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  financial condition” for more details 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us recently enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising the us tax law and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes modifications to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  executive overview  other matters” and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 13 income taxes for more details 

 a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our business partners is stored in our information systems networks and facilities or those of third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property clinical trial information corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information collectively “confidential information” we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems infrastructure and hardware together “it systems” some of which are within the company’s control and some of which are within the control of third parties to accumulate process store and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data maintaining the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business 

it systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources cyberattacks are growing in their frequency sophistication   and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect mitigate or prevent cyberattacks come in many forms including the deployment of harmful malware exploitation of vulnerabilities denialofservice attacks the use of social engineering   and other means to compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems   confidential information and other data breaches resulting in the compromise loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services can occur in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information or wrongful conduct by hackers competitors certain governments or other current or former company personnel our third party partners face similar risks  

the failure or inadequacy of our it systems the compromise loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information or the unauthorized access to disruption of or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems damage our operations customer relationships or reputation or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company 

to date system inadequacies operating failures unauthorized access service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks and the compromise loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we have implemented measures to prevent detect respond to and minimize these risks however these measures may not be successful if they are not successful any of these events could result in material financial legal business or reputational harm to our business and reputation 

 while human pharmaceuticals and companion animal health products have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products affecting our sales volume our food animal business may be affected by depressed prices for our customers’ end products declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce human health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners similarly in the event of a significant economic downturn we could have difficulty accessing credit markets 

 human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims 

 we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos ®  axiron ®  byetta ®  cialis cymbalta and prozac among other products see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 15 contingencies” and item 3 “legal proceedings” for more information on our current product liability litigation because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products 

 the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including us have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations and comparable foreign regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues see item 1 “business  government regulation of our operations” for more details 

 pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters mechanical or information technology system failures or inability to obtain solesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products see item 1 “business  raw materials and product supply” for more details 

 we utilize third parties including suppliers distributors alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development manufacture commercialization support for information technology systems product distribution and certain financial transactional processes for example we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 the animal health operating segment may be impacted by among other things emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets and failure of our research and development acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income

1 the fdas fast track program is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs 

2 continued approval for this indication may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory phase iii trial 

3 as part of a conditional marketing authorization results from an ongoing phase iii study will need to be provided this study is fully enrolled until availability of the full data the committee for medicinal products for human use will review the benefits and risks of lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

elanco animal health 

we are reviewing strategic alternatives for elanco animal health our animal health segment including an initial public offering merger sale or retention of the business and will provide an update no later than the middle of 2018 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenue cash flows and earnings we lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia and bipolar mania indications for zyprexa ®  in japan in december 2015 and april 2016 respectively generic versions of zyprexa launched in japan in june 2016 the loss of exclusivity for zyprexa in japan has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product 

we lost our patent exclusivity for strattera ®  in the us in may 2017 and generic versions of strattera were approved in the same month as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements following the settlement related to the compound patent challenge for effient ®  generic products launched in the us in the third quarter of 2017 the entry of generic competition for these products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

our compound patent protection for cialis ®  tadalafil and adcirca ®  tadalafil expired in major european markets and the us in november 2017 however cialis is protected by a unit dose patent in the us where we expect exclusivity to end in late september 2018 at the earliest we expect that the entry of generic competition into these markets following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in 

revenue for the affected products which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

additionally as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the alimta ®  vitamin regimen patents which provide us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries and through may 2022 in the us have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdictions our compound patent for alimta expired in the us in january 2017 and expired in major european countries and japan in december 2015 we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows while the us patent and trademark office recently ruled in our favor regarding the validity of the vitamin regimen patent the generic companies which filed petitions seeking inter partes  review of our vitamin regimen patent have appealed these rulings as further described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we are aware that generic competitors have received approval to market generic versions of pemetrexed in major european markets and that a generic product is currently on the market in at least one major european market in light of the united kingdom uk supreme courts judgment finding infringement in the uk italy france and spain actavis has withdrawn its previously launchedatrisk generic products from these markets we will continue to seek to remove any generic pemetrexed products launched at risk in other european markets notwithstanding our patents generic versions of alimta were also approved in japan starting in february 2016 as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we do not currently anticipate that generic versions of alimta will proceed to pricing approval 

the compound patent for humalog ®  insulin lispro has expired in major markets thus far the loss of compound patent protection for humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro a similar version of insulin lispro has received approval in the us and could launch soon we are also aware that a competitors insulin lispro product has launched in certain european markets other manufacturers have efforts underway to bring to market a similar version of insulin lispro in the us and europe while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect a rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect competitive pressure and some loss of market share initially that would continue over time 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses over the past two years we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuations between the us dollar and several other foreign currencies including the euro british pound and japanese yen while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis including the significant deterioration of the bolívar resulted in a charge of 2039 million in 2016 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the charge as of december 31 2017 our venezuelan subsidiaries represented a de minimis  portion of our consolidated assets and liabilities we continue to monitor other deteriorating economies and it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

united states 

in the us public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal and state measures may be enacted key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity modifications to medicare parts b and d language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in medicare proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information and statelevel proposals related to prescription drug prices and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs several states enacted legislation in 2017 related to prescription drug pricing transparency savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and nonhealth care initiatives or to manage federal and state budgets the bipartisan budget act enacted on february 9 2018 will require manufacturers of brandname drugs biologics and biosimilars to pay a 70 percent discount in the medicare part d coverage gap up from the current 50 percent discount this increase in coverage gap discounts will be effective beginning in 2019 

in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans pharmaceutical benefit managers wholesalers and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy fewer side effects or greater patient ease of use but also by providing rebates price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid a trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high outofpocket costs for patients particularly for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market driven in part by aca changes such as the 2022 implementation of the excise tax on employersponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit the socalled cadillac tax continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time repealing and replacing the aca remains a priority for president trump and congress provisions included in final legislation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performancebased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products 

tax matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us recently enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising us tax law and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes other organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development and the european commission are active regarding taxrelated matters which could influence international tax policy in countries in which we operate while outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain modifications to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

in december 2017 the president of the us signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act includes significant changes to the us corporate income tax system such as the reduction in the corporate income tax rate transition to a territorial tax system changes to business related exclusions deductions and credits and modifications to international tax provisions including a onetime repatriation transition tax also known as the ‘toll tax’ on unremitted foreign earnings us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that the income tax accounting effects from a change in tax laws or tax rates be recognized in continuing operations in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change these effects include among other things remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities evaluating deferred tax assets for valuation allowances and assessing the impact of the toll tax and certain other provisions of the 2017 tax act we were not able to completely gather analyze and compute all impacts of the 2017 tax act therefore the estimated income tax expense of 191 billion that we recorded in december 2017 related to the 2017 tax act is a provisional amount based upon reasonable estimates and may change upon completion of our calculations see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in addition changes in our interpretations of the new tax laws along with subsequent regulations interpretations and guidance that have been and may be issued may materially affect the estimates and assumptions used in recording the changes to our 2017 us federal and state income tax expense that resulted from the 2017 tax act refer to “results of operations  financial condition” for discussion of the impact of the 2017 tax act on our liquidity

1 us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 

the following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

in the us the revenue increase in 2017  was driven by increased volume for new pharmaceutical products including trulicity ®  taltz ®  basaglar ®  lartruvo and jardiance ®  and higher realized prices for several pharmaceutical products primarily forteo ®  and cialis as well as increased volume for companion animal products from the acquisition of bivip the increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume due to loss of exclusivity for strattera and effient as well as decreased demand for cialis and food animal products cymbalta ®  revenue declined as 2016 revenue benefited from reductions to the reserve for expected product returns of approximately 175 million 

outside the us the revenue increase in 2017  was due to increased volume for several new pharmaceutical products primarily driven by trulicity and cyramza ®  the increase in revenue was partially offset by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity for alimta in several countries and lower volume from the loss of exclusivity for zyprexa in japan 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2017  compared with 2016  

numbers may not add due to rounding 

 nm  not meaningful 

revenue of humalog our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes increased   2 percent  in the us primarily driven by higher realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts which decreased revenue in 2016 and increased revenue in 2017 revenue outside the us increased   6 percent  driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent higher realized prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates a similar version of insulin lispro has received tentative approval in the us and could launch soon we are also aware that a competitors insulin lispro product has launched in certain european markets while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market we do not expect a rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect competitive pressure and some loss of market share initially that would continue over time see results of operations  executive overview  other matters for more information 

revenue of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia decreased   8 percent  in the us driven by decreased demand partially offset by higher realized prices revenue outside the us decreased   4 percent  driven by the decreased volume partially offset by higher realized prices we lost our compound patent protection for cialis in major european markets in november 2017 and now expect us exclusivity for cialis to end in late september 2018 at the earliest see results of operations  executive overview  other matters for more information regarding our us exclusivity in addition to potential competition from generic tadalafil we also currently face competition from generic sildenafil which we expect to accelerate during 2018 we expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue 

revenue of alimta a treatment for various cancers decreased   6 percent  in the us driven by decreased demand due to competitive pressure revenue outside the us decreased   13 percent  driven by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity in several countries we have faced and remain exposed to generic entry in multiple countries that has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue from current levels 

revenue of trulicity a treatment for type 2 diabetes increased   118 percent  in the us driven by increased share of market for trulicity and growth in the glp1 class revenue outside the us increased   123 percent  

revenue of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women increased   25 percent  in the us driven by higher realized prices and increased volume primarily due to wholesaler buying patterns revenue outside the us increased   7 percent  driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices 

revenue of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased   3 percent  in the us driven by higher realized prices revenue outside the us decreased   11 percent  driven primarily by decreased volume and lower realized prices 

revenue of cyramza a treatment for various cancers increased   3 percent  in the us driven by increased volume revenue outside the us increased   39 percent  primarily due to strong volume growth in japan partially offset by lower realized prices and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia decreased   57 percent  in the us driven by reductions to the reserve for expected product returns which increased revenue by approximately 175 million in 2016 revenue outside the us decreased 3  percent driven by the loss of exclusivity in canada and europe partially offset by increased volume in japan 

revenue of erbitux a treatment for various cancers decreased   7 percent  in the us in 2017  the decrease was due to increased competition from immunooncology products 

revenue of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder decreased   47 percent  in the us driven by the loss of exclusivity in the second quarter of 2017 partially offset by higher realized prices the entry of generic competition following the loss of effective patent protection has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue revenue outside the us increased   4 percent  driven by increased volume in japan partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates primarily the japanese yen 

worldwide food animal revenue decreased   8 percent  primarily driven by market access and competitive pressure in the us for posilac ®  and optaflexx ®  respectively worldwide companion animal revenue increased   10 percent  driven by the inclusion of 2167 million  in revenue from the acquisition of bivivp partially offset by competitive pressure we expect these pressures for both companion animal and food animal to continue offset in part by new product launches 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 735 percent  in 2017  an increase of 01  percentage points compared with 2016  primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and product mix 

research and development expenses increased   1 percent  to 528 billion  in 2017  

marketing selling and administrative expenses increased   2 percent  to 659 billion  in 2017  driven by increased marketing expenses for new products that were partially offset by decreased expenses related to late lifecycle products 

we recognized acquired iprd charges of 111 billion  in 2017  resulting from business development activity primarily related to the acquisition of colucid in 2016  we recognized acquired iprd charges of 300 million  associated with the agreement with astrazeneca to codevelop medi1814 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 167 billion  in 2017  the charges are primarily associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure including the us voluntary early retirement program asset impairments related to lower projected revenue for posilac and asset impairments and other special charges related to product rationalizations and site closures resulting from our acquisition and integration of novartis ah in 2016  we recognized 3825 million  of asset impairment restructuring and other special charges primarily associated with integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of novartis ah other global severance costs associated with actions taken to reduce cost structure and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in ireland see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 524 million  in 2017  compared with expense of 848 million  in 2016  other—net income expense in 2016  included a 2039 million charge related to the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis including the significant deterioration of the bolívar partially offset by net gains of 1016 million on investments see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during   2017  we recorded income tax expense of   240 billion   which included a provisional tax charge of 191 billion despite earning   220 billion   of income before income taxes the provisional tax charge is a result of the 2017 tax act including the toll tax re fer to “results of operations  executive overview  other matters  tax matters” for further discussion on the 2017 tax act   the effective tax rate in   2016  was 189 percent

revenue of alimta decreased 5 percent in the us driven by decreased demand due to competitive pressure revenue outside the us decreased 11 percent driven primarily by the loss of exclusivity in several countries we faced exposure to generic entry in multiple countries that eroded revenue 

revenue of forteo increased 26 percent in the us driven by higher realized prices revenue outside the us decreased 1 percent driven by lower realized prices largely offset by increased volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of humulin increased 13 percent in the us driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher realized prices the increase in realized prices resulted from a change in estimate of a government rebate in the first quarter of 2016 revenue outside the us decreased 7 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent decreased volume and lower realized prices 

revenue of cymbalta was 2693 million in the us in 2016 compared to 1446 million in 2015 us revenue benefited from reductions to the cymbalta reserve for expected product returns of approximately 175 million in 2016 revenue outside the us decreased 25 percent driven by the loss of exclusivity 

revenue of trulicity was 7376 million in the us driven by growth in the glp1 market and increased share of market for trulicity revenue outside the us was 1879 million

revenue of zyprexa a treatment for schizophrenia decreased 16 percent outside the us driven primarily by decreased volumes in japan due to the entry of generic competition in june 2016 following the loss of patent exclusivity zyprexa revenue in japan was 3323 million in 2016 compared with 4159 million in 2015 

revenue of erbitux increased to 5811 million in the us in 2016 compared to 3867 million in 2015 the increase was due to the transfer of commercialization rights to us in the us and canada which occurred on october 1 2015 

revenue of animal health products in the us increased 1 percent primarily due to uptake of new companion animal products partially offset by decreased revenue for food animal products animal health product revenue outside the us decreased 3 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 734 percent in 2016 a decrease of 14 percentage points compared with 2015 primarily due to a lower benefit from foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 

research and development expense increased 9 percent to 524 billion in 2016 driven primarily by higher latestage clinical development costs and to a lesser extent higher charges related to development milestone payments 

marketing selling and administrative expense decreased 1 percent to 645 billion in 2016 as reduced spending on latelifecycle products was largely offset by expenses related to new products 

we recognized an acquired iprd charge of 300 million in 2016 associated with the agreement with astrazeneca to codevelop medi1814 there were 5350 million of acquired iprd charges in 2015 resulting from business development activity primarily a collaboration with pfizer and the acquisition of worldwide rights to locemias intranasal glucagon see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

our effective tax rate was 189 percent in 2016 compared with 137 percent in 2015 the increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 reflects several factors in both years in 2016 the unfavorable tax effect of the charge related to the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis and certain asset impairment restructuring and other special charges and in 2015 the favorable tax impact of the acquired iprd charges net charges related to the repurchase of debt and asset impairment restructuring and other special charges the increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 was partially offset by a net discrete tax benefit 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2017  cash and cash equivalents was 654 billion  an increase of 195 billion  compared with 458 billion  at december 31 2016  refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016

for the 132 nd  consecutive year we distributed dividends to our shareholders dividends of 208 per share and 204 per share were paid in 2017  and 2016  respectively in the fourth quarter of 2017  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2018  the quarterly dividend was increased to 05625 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2018  of 225 per share 

capital expenditures of 108 billion  during 2017  were 398 million  more than in 2016  we expect 2018  capital expenditures to be approximately 12 billion 

in 2017  we repurchased 3598 million  of shares under the 500 billion  share repurchase program previously announced in october 2013 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

see results of operations  executive overview  other matters  patent matters for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection 

pursuant to the 2017 tax act the us will transition to a territorial tax system effective january 1 2018 therefore we expect that future repatriations of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the us will result in immaterial or no tax payments this change in tax law provides us with additional liquidity in the us without the requirement to pay us taxes as existed prior to the enactment of the new tax law we believe cash provided by operating activities along with available cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including installment payments of the toll tax dividends paid to shareholders share repurchases and capital expenditures over the course of 2018 and 2019 we plan to deploy the additional liquidity created from the tax law across our capital allocation priorities including funding our existing marketed products and pipeline including capital investments in line with our current strategy investing in business development to bolster our future growth prospects returning cash to shareholders via increases to the dividend and share buybacks and reducing our gross debt 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2017  and 2016  including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound and the swiss franc against the euro we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro the japanese yen and the british pound our corporate riskmanagement policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2017  and 2016  would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows 

1 our longterm debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps we used the interest rate forward curve at december 31 2017  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 

2 we have included the following 

 3 the 2017 tax act provides an election to taxpayers subject to the toll tax to make payments over an eightyear period we intend to make this election therefore we have included future toll tax payments accordingly the amounts shown reflect the provisional amount of toll tax recorded at december 31 2017 these amounts are subject to change see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

4 we have included longterm liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and other postemployment benefit liabilities we excluded longterm income taxes payable of 8309 million because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2017  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report as discussed in income taxes later in this section we were unable to completely assess all impacts of the 2017 tax act therefore the estimate that we recorded is a provisional amount based upon reasonable estimates and may change upon completion of our calculations our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

sales returns  background and uncertainties 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated productsupply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the revenue of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product revenue discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product revenue trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is based on several factors including historical return rates expiration date by product on average approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels among others as well as any other specificallyidentified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity product recalls and discontinuances or a changing competitive environment we maintain a returns policy that allows us pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the products expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our assumptions which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net revenue over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue 

sales rebates and discounts  background and uncertainties 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care medicare medicaid chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care medicare and medicaid contracts in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical managed care medicare and medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries and product launches an evaluation of the current managed care medicare and medicaid contracts the percentage of our products that are sold via managed care medicare and medicaid contracts and our product pricing although we accrue a liability for managed care medicare and medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the managed care medicare and medicaid rebate related to that sale is paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserves 

financial statement impact 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017  a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate 240 million  effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was 87 percent and 85 percent as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us pharmaceutical sales return rebate and discount liability balances including managed care medicare and medicaid 



1 adjustments of the estimates for these returns rebates and discounts to actual results were approximately 1 percent  of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

background and uncertainties 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we also consider any thirdparty indemnification to which we are entitled including the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

background and uncertainties 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in “results of operations  executive overview  latestage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary materially from these estimates 

retirement benefits assumptions 

background and uncertainties 

defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate expected return on plan assets and retirement age these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected return on plan assets we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 80 percent  of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

financial statement impact 

if the 2017  discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 300 million  as of january 1 2016 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan costs prior to this change the service and interest costs were determined using a single weightedaverage discount rate based on yield curves of high quality fixed income debt instruments used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period this new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash outflows of our obligations the new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the specific spot yield curve rates the change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs is recorded in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss we accounted for this as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in 2016 

if the 2017  expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 237 million  if our assumption regarding the 2017  expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 348 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 75 percent  and 80 percent  of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets respectively at december 31 2017  

income taxes 

background and uncertainties 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are 

subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of a tax examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

the 2017 tax act was enacted in december 2017 and introduced numerous significant changes to the us corporate income tax system in accordance with gaap we recorded an estimate of the changes to our us federal and state income tax expense that resulted from the 2017 tax act which included remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities evaluating deferred tax assets for valuation allowances and assessing the impact of the toll tax and certain other provisions of the 2017 tax act since we were unable to completely assess all impacts of the 2017 tax act the estimate that we recorded is a provisional amount based upon reasonable estimates and may change upon completion of our calculations refer to results of operations  executive overview  other matters  tax matters and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the 2017 tax act assimilation of the 2017 tax act will be ongoing as we continue to analyze the new law and as future directives are issued including regulations interpretations and guidance which may materially affect the estimates and assumptions used in recording the changes to 2017 us federal and state income tax expense 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2017  a 5 percent change in the amount of the provisional charge related to the 2017 tax act uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 957 million  335 million  and 355 million  respectively 

acquisitions 

background and uncertainties 

to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition we make certain judgments which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules 

if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets where applicable is recorded as goodwill if the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and therefore any acquired iprd that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as well as estimated asset lives can materially affect our consolidated results of 

operations the fair values of intangible assets including acquired iprd are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management depending on the facts and circumstances we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities 

the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities or a discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments including but not limited to revenue and the discount rate 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2017  a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of 127 million

financial expectations for 2018   

for the full year of 2018  we expect eps to be in the range of 439 to 449 which reflects the estimated impact of the 2017 tax act we anticipate that total revenue will be between 230 billion and 235 billion revenue growth is expected to be driven by new products including trulicity taltz basaglar jardiance verzenio cyramza olumiant and lartruvo 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 73 percent in 2018  research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of 50 billion to 52 billion marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 61 billion to 64 billion other—net income expense is expected to be income in the range of 75 million to 175 million 

the 2018  tax rate is expected to be approximately 180 percent and reflects the estimated impact of the 2017 tax act refer to “results of operations  executive overview  other matters  tax matters” for further discussion of the 2017 tax act the 2018 tax rate benefits from a lower corporate income tax rate partially offset by the changes to certain business exclusions deductions credits and international tax provisions and is subject to change based upon changes in our interpretations of the new tax law along with subsequent regulations interpretations and guidance that have been and may be issued 

capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 12 billion

the mission of our human pharmaceutical business is to make medicines that help people live longer healthier more active lives our vision is to make a significant contribution to humanity by improving global health in the 21st century most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover develop and bring to market innovative new medicines 

our animal health business operating through our elanco division develops manufactures and markets products for both food animals and companion animals elanco food animal products help the food industry produce an abundant supply of safe nutritious and affordable food elanco companion animal products help pets live longer healthier happier lives 

we manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the united states us puerto rico and 14 other countries our products are sold in approximately 125 countries

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs 

human pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the us we distribute human pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2016 2015 and 2014 three wholesale distributors in the us—mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 8 percent  and 17 percent  of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major human pharmaceutical products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

human pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the us we promote our human pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in consolidated revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

human pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our human pharmaceutical products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the us and has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors elanco promotes its products primarily to producers and veterinarians for food animal products and to veterinarians for companion animal products elanco also advertises certain companion animal products directly to pet owners in markets where it is consistent with allowable promotional practices 

competition 

our human pharmaceutical products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors for both human pharmaceutical and animal health products include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective human pharmaceutical and animal health products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will be or become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturers generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic human pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products many of our animal health products also compete with generics 

biosimilars 

several of our current products including cyramza erbitux trulicity portrazza and taltz and many of the new molecular entities nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an an approved innovator biologic that due to its physicalstructural similarity to the original product is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the originator product globally governments have or are developing regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovatordeveloped biologics but the patent for the existing branded product must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example with our partner boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar a new insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as the product currently marketed by a competitor this product has launched as a followon biologic in the us and as a biosimilar in the eu and japan 

us private sector payer consolidation 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance 

payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect our future consolidated results of operations 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section below in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceuticals typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 



 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceuticals varies widely and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners implementation of this agreement differs between developed and developing countries with many developing countries limiting protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement thus certain types of patents such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules are not available in many developing countries further many developing countries and some developed countries do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trips 

certain of our elanco animal health products are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection historically upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health products we have not generally experienced the rapid and severe declines in revenues that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes uses and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection for our topselling or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 



 outside the us important patent protection or data protection includes 

 baricitinib olumiant has been submitted for regulatory review in the us and japan and is protected by a compound patent in the us and japan until 2030 not including possible patent extension and 2029 not including possible patent extension respectively additional information about this molecule is provided in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—latestage pipeline” 

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our major products are not subject to significant license agreements the compound patent for cialis is the subject of a license agreement with glaxosmithkline glaxo which assigns to us exclusively all rights in the compound the agreement calls for royalties of a singledigit percentage of net sales the agreement is not subject to termination by glaxo for any reason other than a material breach by lilly of the royalty obligation after a substantial cure period 

patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative human pharmaceuticals other than biologics without completion of safety and efficacy studies ie a complete new drug application nda by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative human pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers in hatchwaxman litigation involving forteo alimta and effient among other products for more information on hatchwaxman litigation involving the company see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” and item 3 legal proceedings 

in addition there is a procedure in us patent law known as inter partes  review ipr which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued us patent iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court we are now seeing instances where generic drug companies and some investment funds are attempting to invalidate our patents by filing ipr challenges in the uspto for more information see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our alimta patents in europe and japan see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” 

government regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulations address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal products the impact on humans who consume the food as well as the impact on the environment at the production site compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the us pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical products and certain animal health products in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the doj and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions including china brazil and the united kingdom uk have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our human pharmaceuticals under state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus 43 percent formula drug manufacturers are required to provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes in addition third party organizations including professional associations academic institutions and nonprofit entities associated with payers are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and costbenefit analyses on medicines the impact of which are uncertain at this time 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical products 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2016  we employed approximately 9300 people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 524 billion  in 2016  480 billion  in 2015  and 473 billion  in 2014  

our internal human pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of cancer diabetes neurodegeneration immunology and pain we have a strong biotechnology research program with more than half of our clinicalstage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical products we actively invest in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technologies and potential products from internal and external sources to meet unmet veterinary needs our animal health scientists also leverage discoveries from our human health laboratories to develop products to enhance the health and wellbeing of farm animals and pets 

human pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect data and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

 the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological targets that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become candidate molecules and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one candidate molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low 

 the early development phase involves refining candidate molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals as necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans in general the first human tests often referred to as phase i are conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose has been established the drug is typically administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for 

initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or biomarkers of the disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase approximately 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase can take several years to complete 

 product phase phase iii molecules have already demonstrated safety and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

 once a molecule is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 45  drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapies for various cancers alzheimer’s disease pain migraine rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis and severe hypoglycemia we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development in our chosen priority areas we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products see item 7 managements discussion and analysis—executive overview—latestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials primarily from only one source in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the us ireland puerto rico and the uk finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems inventory management and backup sites 

however human pharmaceutical and animal health production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier 

or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly internal standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination thereof additional assurance of quality is provided by corporate qualityassurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to human pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at thirdparty suppliers

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks certain of these risks could also adversely affect the companys reputation 

 there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 2 billion dimasi ja grabowski hg hansen ra innovation in the pharmaceutical industry new estimates of rd costs   journal of health economics  2016472033 failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory 

agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial position and prospects see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—latestage pipeline” for more details 

 a number of our topselling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost or will lose in the next several years significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as key countries outside the us as illustrated in the tables below 





certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiologic products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues especially in the us historically outside the us the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the us however generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the us including japan europe and many countries in the emerging markets for biologic such as humalog humulin erbitux cyramza trulicity and taltz loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions see item 7 “management’s discussion and 

analysis—executive overview—other matters” and item 1 business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

 our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover develop and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings and may not be upheld in addition a new   ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatchwaxman act as a result our patents may be invalided via this review process although such a decision can be appealed to the courts in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market while a win provides no precedential value  the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” item 3 legal proceedings and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies for more details 

 public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for human pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medications these pressures could negatively affect our future revenues and net income 

we expect pricing reimbursement and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the us to become more severe for more details see item 1 “business—regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—other matters” 

 we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs see item 1 “business—competition” for more details 

 as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—financial condition” for more details 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard changes to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—other matters” and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 income taxes for more details 

 a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our alliances is stored in our information systems networks and facilities or those of third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information collectively “confidential information” we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and infrastructure together “it systems” some of which are within the company’s control and some of which are within the control of third parties to accumulate process store and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data maintaining the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business 

it systems are potentially vulnerable to system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions or cyberattacks from a variety of sources cyber attacks are growing in their frequency sophistication   and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect mitigate or prevent cyberattacks come in many forms including the deployment of harmful malware denialofservice attacks the use of social engineering   and other means to compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our it systems   confidential information and other data breaches resulting in the loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information can occur in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information or wrongful conduct by hackers competitors certain governments or other current or former company personnel our third party partners face similar risks  

the failure or inadequacy of our it systems or the loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights damage our operations customer relationships and reputation and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage public trust in our company 

to date system inadequacies operating failures service interruptions or failures security breaches malicious intrusions cyberattacks and the loss theft destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we have implemented measures to prevent respond to and minimize these risks   however these measures may not be successful if they are not successful any of these events could result in material financial legal business or reputational harm to our business and reputation 

 while human pharmaceuticals and companion animal health products have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products affecting our sales volume our food animal business may be affected by depressed prices for our customers’ end products declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce human health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners similarly in the event of a significant economic downturn we could have difficulty accessing credit markets 

 human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims 

 we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos ®  axiron byetta ®  cialis cymbalta and prozac among other products see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” and item 3 “legal proceedings” for more information on our current product liability litigation because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products 

 the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including us have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations and comparable foreign regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues see item 1 “business—government regulation of our operations” for more details 

 pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters mechanical or information technology system failures or inability to obtain solesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products see item 1 “business—raw materials and product supply” for more details 

 we utilize third parties including suppliers distributors alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development manufacture commercialization support for information technology systems product distribution and certain financial transactional processes for example we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 the animal health operating segment may be impacted by among other things increased sales of companion animal products by nonveterinarian retail outlets emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets and failure of our research and development acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income

tanezumab q3 2008 —an antinerve growth factor monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain chronic low back pain and cancer pain in collaboration with pfizer 

 the following table reflects the status of each nme and diagnostic agent within our latestage pipeline and recently approved products including developments since january 1 2016  





1 the fdas fast track program is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs 

2 continued approval for this indication may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory phase iii trial 

3  as part of a conditional marketing authorization results from an ongoing phase iii study will need to be provided this study is fully enrolled until availability of the full data the committee for medicinal products for human use will review the benefits and risks of lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take over a decade and cost more than 2 billion dimasi ja grabowski hg hansen ra innovation in the pharmaceutical industry new estimates of rd costs   journal of health economics  2016472033 failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the us and in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities consequently it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings the loss of us patent exclusivity for evista ®  in march 2014 resulted in the immediate entry of generic competitors we lost our data package protection for cymbalta ®  in major european countries in 2014 in 2015 we saw the entry of generic competition in all major european markets the loss of exclusivity for evista in the us and cymbalta in the european markets has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the affected products which over time has in the aggregate had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows we also lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia and bipolar mania indications in december 2015 and april 2016 respectively for zyprexa ®  in japan generic versions of zyprexa were launched in japan in june 2016 the loss of exclusivity for zyprexa in japan has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product 

additionally as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the alimta ®  vitamin regimen patents which provide us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries and through may 2022 in the us have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdictions our compound patent for alimta expired in the us in january 2017 and expired in major european countries and japan in december 2015 we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows while the us court of appeals recently ruled in our favor regarding the validity and infringement of the vitamin regimen patent that patent remains the subject of inter partes  review challenges as further described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we are aware that at least two generic pemetrexed products have launched in a major european market notwithstanding our patents generic versions of alimta were also approved in japan in february 2016 as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements each manufacturer of the generic version of alimta has agreed not to proceed to pricing approval 

we will lose our patent protection for strattera ®  in the us in may 2017 and cialis ®  in the us and major european markets in november 2017 we will also lose exclusivity for effient ® in the us in october 2017 and we have authorized one generic manufacturer to enter the market as early as midaugust 2017 we expect that the entry of generic competition into these markets following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the affected products which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the compound patent for humalog ®  insulin lispro has expired in major markets thus far the loss of compound patent protection for humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro and to date none have been approved in the us or europe other manufacturers have efforts underway to bring to market a similar version of insulin lispro and we are aware that a competitors insulin lispro product has been accepted for regulatory review by the european medicines agency it is difficult to predict the impact of these products entering the market 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound and the british pound and swiss franc against the euro while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses over the past two years we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuations between the us dollar and several other foreign currencies including the euro british pound and japanese yen while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations 

the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis including the significant deterioration of the bolívar resulted in a charge of 2039 million in 2016 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the charge as of december 31 2016 our venezuelan subsidiaries represented a de minimis  portion of our consolidated assets and liabilities we continue to monitor other deteriorating economies and it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

united states 

in the us public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal and state measures may be enacted key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity modifications to medicare parts b and d language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in medicare proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information and statelevel proposals to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and nonhealth care initiatives or to manage federal and state budgets 

in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans pharmaceutical benefit managers wholesalers and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy fewer side effects or greater patient ease of use but also by providing rebates price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations 

the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid an emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high outofpocket costs for patients particularly for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market driven in part by aca changes such as the 2020 implementation of the excise tax on employersponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit the socalled cadillac tax continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time president trump the new administration and congress have identified repealing and replacing the aca as a top priority the proposed timeframe remains unclear further provisions included in legislation repealing the aca and any potential replacement program have yet to be determined and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performancebased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products 

tax matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard for example the trump administration has stated that one of its top priorities is comprehensive tax reform the tax rates and the manner in which us companies are taxed could be altered by any such potential tax reform and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows additionally the organisation for economic cooperation and development issued its final recommendations of international tax reform proposals to influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate other institutions have also become more active regarding taxrelated matters including the european commission the united nations the group of twenty and the european parliament while outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain changes to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows

revenue 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity by region 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

1 us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 

the following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

in the us the volume increase in 2016  was driven by sales of several pharmaceutical products including trulicity ®  humalog erbitux ®  due to the transfer of commercialization rights to us in the us and canada effective october 1 2015 taltz and jardiance ®  partially offset by decreased volume for zyprexa us revenue also benefited from reductions to the cymbalta reserve for expected product returns of approximately 175 million in 2016 favorably affecting both volume and price 

outside the us the volume increase in 2016  was driven by sales of several new pharmaceutical products including cyramza and trulicity partially offset by the losses of exclusivity for cymbalta in europe and canada zyprexa in japan as well as alimta in several countries 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2016  compared with 2015  

numbers may not add due to rounding 

 nm  not meaningful 

revenue of humalog our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes decreased   5 percent  in the us driven by lower realized prices partially offset by increased demand revenue outside the us increased   1 percent  driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent higher realized prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia increased   17 percent  in the us driven by higher realized prices we will lose our patent protection for cialis in the us in november 2017 we expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue revenue outside the us decreased   5 percent  driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume partially offset by higher realized prices 

revenue of alimta a treatment for various cancers decreased   5 percent  in the us driven by decreased demand due to competitive pressure revenue outside the us decreased   11 percent  driven primarily by the loss of exclusivity in several countries we have faced and remain exposed to generic entry in multiple countries that has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue from current levels 

revenue of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women increased   26 percent  in the us driven by higher realized prices revenue outside the us decreased   1 percent  driven by lower realized prices largely offset by increased volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased   13 percent  in the us driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher realized prices the increase in realized prices resulted from a change in estimate of a government rebate in the first quarter of 2016 revenue outside the us decreased   7 percent  driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent decreased volume and lower realized prices 

revenue of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia was 2693 million  in the us in 2016 compared to 1446 million  in 2015 us revenue benefited from reductions to the cymbalta reserve for expected product returns of approximately 175 million in 2016 revenue outside the us decreased 25  percent driven by the loss of exclusivity 

revenue of trulicity a treatment for type 2 diabetes was 7376 million  in the us driven by growth in the glp1 market and increased share of market for trulicity revenue outside the us was 1879 million  

revenue of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder increased   7 percent  in the us driven by higher realized prices partially offset by decreased volume we will lose our patent protection for strattera in the us in may 2017 we expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue revenue outside the us increased   13 percent  driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower realized prices 

revenue of zyprexa a treatment for schizophrenia acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder and bipolar maintenance decreased   16 percent  outside the us driven primarily by decreased volumes in japan due to the entry of generic competition in june 2016 following the loss of patent exclusivity zyprexa revenue in japan was 3323 million in 2016 compared with 4159 million in 2015 

revenue of erbitux a treatment for various cancers increased to 5811 million  in the us in 2016 compared to 3867 million  in 2015 the increase was due to the transfer of commercialization rights to us in the us and canada which occurred on october 1 2015 

revenue of animal health products in the us increased   1 percent  primarily due to uptake of new companion animal products partially offset by decreased revenue for food animal products animal health product revenue outside the us decreased   3 percent  driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 734 percent  in 2016  a decrease of 14  percentage points compared with 2015  primarily due to a lower benefit from foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 

research and development expense increased   9 percent  to 524 billion  in 2016  driven primarily by higher latestage clinical development costs and to a lesser extent higher charges related to development milestone payments 

marketing selling and administrative expense decreased   1 percent  to 645 billion  in 2016  as reduced spending on latelifecycle products was largely offset by expenses related to new products 

we recognized an acquired iprd charge of 300 million  in 2016  associated with the agreement with astrazeneca to codevelop medi1814 there were 5350 million  of acquired iprd charges in 2015  resulting from business development activity primarily a collaboration with pfizer and the acquisition of worldwide rights to locemias intranasal glucagon see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 3825 million  in 2016  the charges are primarily associated with integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of novartis ah other global severance costs associated with actions taken to reduce cost structure and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in ireland in 2015  we recognized 3677 million  of asset impairment restructuring and other special charges related to severance costs integration costs for novartis ah and asset impairments see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was expense of 848 million  in 2016  compared with income of 1006 million  in 2015  other expense in 2016  included a 2039 million charge related to the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis including the significant deterioration of the bolívar partially offset by net gains of 1016 million on investments other income in 2015  included net gains of 2367 million on investments partially offset by a net charge of 1527 million related to the repurchase of 165 billion of debt see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 189 percent  in 2016  compared with 137 percent  in 2015  the increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 reflects several factors in both years in 2016 the unfavorable tax effect of the charge related to the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis and certain asset impairment restructuring and other special charges and in 2015 the favorable tax impact of the acquired iprd charges net charges related to the repurchase of debt and asset impairment restructuring and other special charges the increase in the effective tax rate for 2016  was partially offset by a net discrete tax benefit

revenue of humulin increased 7 percent in the us driven by higher realized prices and to a lesser extent wholesaler buying patterns partially offset by decreased demand revenue outside the us decreased 21 percent driven by decreased volume primarily due to the loss of a government contract in brazil and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of cymbalta decreased 66 percent in the us due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in december 2013 revenue outside the us decreased 26 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity in europe in 2014 

revenue of zyprexa increased 31 percent in the us driven by adjustments to the return reserve resulting from the expiration of the period to return expired product for credit revenue outside the us decreased 15 percent driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates we lost patent exclusivity for zyprexa in japan in december 2015 zyprexa revenue in japan was 4159 million in 2015 compared with 

4662 million in 2014 the revenue decrease in japan was due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of strattera increased 11 percent in the us driven by higher realized prices and to a lesser extent increased demand revenue outside the us decreased 1 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates largely offset by increased volume 

revenue of effient a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an arteryopening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention including patients undergoing angioplasty atherectomy or stent placement increased 6 percent in the us driven by higher realized prices partially offset by decreased demand revenue outside the us decreased 17 percent driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of evista a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer decreased 70 percent in the us due to the loss of patent exclusivity in march 2014 revenue outside the us decreased 17 percent driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenue of animal health products in the us increased 21 percent and animal health product revenue outside the us increased 53 percent the increases were driven by the inclusion of revenue from novartis ah 

on a pro forma basis which reflects the 2014 revenue of novartis ah as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements revenue of animal health products in the us would have decreased 1 percent driven primarily by decreased volume in food animal products revenue outside the us would have decreased 13 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in companion animal products partially offset by higher realized prices and volume for food animal products 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 748 percent in 2015 essentially flat compared with 2014 as the unfavorable impacts of the inclusion of novartis ah and inventory stepup and amortization costs were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 

research and development expense increased 1 percent to 480 billion in 2015 driven primarily by higher latestage clinical development costs the inclusion of novartis ah and an increase in charges associated with the termination of latestage molecules primarily evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro of approximately 135 million partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

marketing selling and administrative expense decreased 1 percent to 653 billion in 2015 due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 2014 charge associated with the us drug fee partially offset by the inclusion of novartis ah and expenses related to new product launches 

we recognized acquired iprd charges of 5350 million in 2015 resulting from various collaboration agreements primarily with pfizer as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to locemias intranasal glucagon there were 2002 million of acquired iprd charges in 2014 related to various collaboration agreements including charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us from boehringer ingelheim of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 3677 million in 2015 the charges relate to severance costs integration costs for novartis ah and asset impairments in 2014 we recognized charges of 4687 million for asset impairment restructuring and other special charges the charges included severance costs asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in puerto rico and integration costs for the thenpending acquisition of novartis ah see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 1006 million in 2015 compared with income of 3405 million in 2014 other income in 2015 included net gains of 2367 million on investments partially offset by a net charge of 1527 million related to the repurchase of 165 billion of debt other income in 2014 included net 

gains of 2164 million on investments and 920 million of income associated with the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to boehringer ingelheim see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 137 percent in 2015 compared with 203 percent in 2014 the effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of a 1190 million nondeductible charge associated with the us drug fee the decrease in the tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to a favorable tax impact of the net charges related to the repurchase of debt acquired iprd and asset impairment restructuring and other special charges see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2016  cash and cash equivalents was 458 billion  an increase of 9157 million  compared with 367 billion  at december 31 2015  refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

in addition to our cash and cash equivalents we held total investments of 666 billion  and 443 billion  as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

as of december 31 2016  total debt was 1031 billion  an increase of 233 billion  compared with 798 billion  at december 31 2015  this increase is primarily due to the net issuance of 130 billion of shortterm commercial paper borrowings and the 121 billion  issuance of swiss franc debt at december 31 2016  we had a total of 287 billion  of unused committed bank credit facilities 270 billion  of which is available to support our commercial paper program see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowing needs 

in january 2017 we completed our acquisition of boehringer ingelheim vetmedica incs us feline canine and rabies vaccine portfolio in an allcash transaction for approximately 885 million  including the estimated cost of inventory which was funded through the issuance of commercial paper in january 2017 we announced an agreement to acquire colucid for 4650  per share or approximately 960 million  we anticipate issuing debt to fund the transaction which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2017 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for the 131st consecutive year we distributed dividends to our shareholders dividends of 204 per share and 200 per share were paid in 2016  and 2015  respectively in the fourth quarter of 2016  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2017  the quarterly dividend was increased to 052 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2017  of 208 per share 

capital expenditures of 104 billion  during 2016  were 292 million  less than in 2015  we expect 2017  capital expenditures to be approximately 12 billion 

in 2016  we repurchased 5401 million  of shares under the 500 billion  share repurchase program previously announced in october 2013 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

see results of operations—executive overview—other matters for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection for evista us cymbalta europe alimta us europe and japan zyprexa japan strattera us effient us and cialis us and europe 

at december 31 2016  we had an aggregate of 977 billion  of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries a significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the us we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us no accrual for us income taxes is provided we believe cash provided by operating activities in the us and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs dividends paid to shareholders share repurchases and capital expenditures 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2016  and 2015  including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound and the british pound and swiss franc against the euro we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro the japanese yen and the british pound our corporate riskmanagement policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2016  and 2015  would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows 

1   our longterm debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps we used the interest rate forward curve at december 31 2016  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 

2   we have included the following 

 3   we have included longterm liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities we excluded longterm income taxes payable of 6889 million because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2016  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

sales returns  background and uncertainties 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated productsupply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the revenue of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product revenue discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product revenue trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is based on several factors including historical return rates expiration date by product generally 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels among others as well as any other specificallyidentified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity product recalls and discontinuances or a changing competitive environment we maintain a returns policy that allows us pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the products expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our assumptions which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net revenue over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue 

sales rebates and discounts  background and uncertainties 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care medicare medicaid chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care medicare and medicaid contracts in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical managed care medicare and medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries and product launches an evaluation of the current managed care medicare and medicaid contracts the percentage of our products that are sold via managed care medicare and medicaid contracts and our product pricing although we accrue a liability for managed care medicare and medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the managed care medicare and medicaid rebate related to that sale is paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserves 

financial statement impact 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate 214 million  effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was 85 percent and 87 percent as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us pharmaceutical sales return rebate and discount liability balances including managed care medicare and medicaid 



1  adjustments of the estimates for these returns rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 10 percent  of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

background and uncertainties 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we also consider any thirdparty indemnification to which we are entitled including the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

financial statement impact 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

background and uncertainties 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in “results of operations—executive overview—latestage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary materially from these estimates 

retirement benefits assumptions 

background and uncertainties 

defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate expected return on plan assets and retirement age these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected return on plan assets we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 80 percent  of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

financial statement impact 

if the 2016  discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 346 million  as of january 1 2016 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan costs prior to this change the service and interest costs were determined using a single weightedaverage discount rate based on yield curves of high quality fixed income debt instruments used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period this new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash outflows of our obligations the new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the specific spot yield curve rates the change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs is recorded in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss we accounted for this as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in 2016 

if the 2016  expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 234 million  if our assumption regarding the 2016  expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 438 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 75 percent  and 80 percent  of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets respectively at december 31 2016  

income taxes 

background and uncertainties 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2016  a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 191 million  and 324 million  respectively 

acquisitions 

background and uncertainties 

to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition we make certain judgments which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules as discussed further in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements a modified definition of a business is effective for our acquisitions subsequent to october 1 2016 

if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets where applicable is recorded as goodwill if the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and therefore any acquired iprd that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as well as estimated asset lives can materially affect our consolidated results of operations the fair values of intangible assets including acquired iprd are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management depending on the facts and circumstances we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities 

the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities or a discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments including but not limited to revenue and the discount rate 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2016  a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of 229 million

financial expectations for 2017   

for the full year of 2017  we expect eps to be in the range of 269 to 279 which reflects the estimated acquired iprd charge related to the planned acquisition of colucid we anticipate that total revenue will be between 218 billion and 223 billion excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates we expect revenue growth from animal health products and a number of established pharmaceutical products including trajenta forteo and humalog as well as higher revenue from new products including trulicity taltz basaglar ®  cyramza jardiance and lartruvo 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 735 percent in 2017  research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of 49 billion to 51 billion marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 64 billion to 66 billion other—net income expense is expected to be income of up to 100 million 

the 2017  tax rate is expected to be approximately 245 percent which reflects the nondeductibility for tax purposes of the estimated acquired iprd charge related to the planned acquisition of colucid 

capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 12 billion 

amortization and inventory stepup costs associated with the acquisition of boehringer ingelheim vetmedica incs us feline canine and rabies vaccines portfolio included in our 2017  financial guidance are subject to final inventory quantities purchased and acquisition accounting adjustments the acquired iprd charge related to the planned acquisition of colucid included in our 2017  financial guidance is subject to final accounting upon completion of the acquisition

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs 

human pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the us we distribute human pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2015 2014 and 2013 three wholesale distributors in the us—amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 8 percent  and 19 percent  of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major human pharmaceutical products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

human pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the us we promote our human pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives   while the products marketed vary from country to country endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in total revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

human pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our human pharmaceutical products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 

 for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 4 collaborations and other arrangements 

animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the us and has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors elanco promotes its products primarily to producers and veterinarians for food animal products and to veterinarians for companion animal products elanco also advertises certain companion animal products directly to pet owners in markets where it is consistent with allowable promotional practices 

competition 

our human pharmaceutical products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors for both human pharmaceutical and animal health products include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective human pharmaceutical and animal health products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturers generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic human pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete 

with generic or counterfeit versions of our products many of our animal health products also compete with generics 

biosimilars 

several of our current products including cyramza erbitux trulicity and portrazza and many of the new molecular entities nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an an approved innovator biologic that due to its physicalstructural similarity to the original product is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the originator product globally governments have or are developing regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovatordeveloped biologics but the patent for the existing branded product must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example with our partner boehringer ingelheim we have developed basaglar a new insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as the product currently marketed by a competitor our product has launched in the eu and japan and can be launched in the us on december 15 2016 

us private sector payer consolidation 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance 

payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebates price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect our future consolidated results of operations 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section below in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceuticals typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which can result in severe and rapid decline in sales of the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners implementation of this agreement differs between developed and developing 

countries with many developing countries limiting protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement thus certain types of patents such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules are not available in many developing countries further many developing countries do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trips 

certain of our elanco animal health products are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection historically upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health products we have not generally experienced the rapid and severe declines in revenues that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes uses and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection for our topselling or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 

 

outside the us important patent protection or data protection includes 

 us patent protection or data protection for our new molecular entities that have been submitted for regulatory review is as follows additional information about these molecules is provided in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis—latestage pipeline” 

 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our major products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our largest products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others 

 patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws for human pharmaceuticals before the hatchwaxman act no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie a complete new drug application nda the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative human pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative human pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers in hatchwaxman litigation involving alimta and effient among other products for more information on hatchwaxman litigation involving the company see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” and item 3 legal proceedings 

the passage of the america invents act in 2011 added a new procedure to us patent law this procedure inter partes  review ipr allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued us patent iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court we are now seeing instances where generic drug companies and some investment funds are attempting to invalidate our patents by filing ipr challenges in the uspto for more information see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our alimta patents in europe and japan see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” 

government regulation 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulations address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal products the impact on humans who consume the food as well as the impact on the environment at the production site the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the us pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical products and certain animal health products in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive company 

wide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the doj and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions including china brazil and the united kingdom uk have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our human pharmaceuticals under state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus 43 percent formula drug manufacturers are required to provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes in addition third party organizations including professional associations academic institutions and nonprofit entities associated with payers are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and costbenefit analyses on medicines the impact of which are uncertain at this time 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical products 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2015  we employed approximately 8730 people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 480 billion  in 2015  473 billion  in 2014  and 553 billion  in 2013  

our internal human pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of cancer diabetes neurodegeneration immunology and pain we have a strong biotechnology research program with more than half of our clinicalstage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients across all our therapeutic areas we are increasingly focusing our efforts on tailored therapeutics seeking to identify and use advanced diagnostic tools and other information to identify specific subgroups of patients for whom our medicines—or potentially those of other companies—will be the best treatment option 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical products we actively seek out external investments in research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technologies and potential products from internal and external sources to meet unmet veterinary needs our animal health scientists also leverage discoveries from our human health laboratories to develop products to enhance the health and wellbeing of farm animals and pets 

human pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect data and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

 the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological “targets” that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become “candidate” molecules and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one candidate molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low 

 the early development phase involves refining candidate molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals as necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans in general the first human tests often referred to as phase i are conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose has been established the drug is typically administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or biomarkers of the disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase approximately 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase can take several years to complete 

 product phase phase iii molecules have already demonstrated safety and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

 once a molecule is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 50  drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapies for various cancers alzheimer’s disease pain migraines rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis and severe hypoglycemia we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development in our chosen priority areas we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products see item 7 managements discussion and analysis—latestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at four owned sites in the us as well as owned sites in ireland puerto rico and the uk finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems inventory management and backup sites 

however human pharmaceutical and animal health production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly internal standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by corporate qualityassurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to human pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at thirdparty suppliers

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks certain of these risks could also adversely affect the companys reputation 

 there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stages after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved uses difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that   are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial position and prospects 

 a number of our topselling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost or will lose in the next several years significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as key countries outside the us as illustrated in the tables below 





certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiological products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues especially in the us historically outside the us the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the us however generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the us including japan europe and many countries in the emerging markets for biological products such as humalog humulin erbitux and cyramza loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—other matters” and item 1 business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

 our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover develop and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings and may not be upheld we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in sales in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” item 3 legal proceedings and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies for more details 

 public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for human pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medications these pressures could negatively affect our future revenues and income 

in the us public concern over prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals continues to drive the legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal and state measures may be enacted key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity modifications to medicare parts b and d new language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in part d and statelevel proposals to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and nonhealth care initiatives or to manage federal and state budgets 

in the us private sector health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payers typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered and the cost to the consumer nonpreferred formulary placement including the exclusion of a drug from a formulary typically leads to its reduced usage in the patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete to have their branded products included by among other things providing offsetting rebates price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which payers take the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable 

the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca are now in effect through both the launch of statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid an emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high patient outofpocket costs for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market driven in part by aca changes such as the 2020 implementation of the excise tax on employersponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit the socalled cadillac tax continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards qualitybased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives are placing demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products 

we expect pricing reimbursement and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the us to become more severe for more details see item 1 “business—regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—other matters” 

 we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with drugs see item 1 “business—competition” for more details 

 as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound and the british pound against the euro while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard for example the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries other tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress could change the tax rate and manner in which us companies would be taxed additionally the organisation for economic cooperation and development issued its final recommendations of international tax reform proposals to influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate while outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain changes to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 income taxes for more details 

 the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including us have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations and comparable foreign regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures fines and penalties interruption of production leading to product shortages and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues see item 1 “business—regulation of our operations” for more details 

 a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our alliances is stored in our information systems networks and facilities or those of third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information some of this information is created accessed andor maintained by third parties the confidentiality of this information may be breached in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with 

permitted access to our systems and data or wrongful conduct by certain governments hackers unethical competitors or former workforce members the rapid growth of factors such as mobile computing capacity highspeed internet access and social media exacerbates the risk of information security breaches 

the theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights cause damage to company operations and reputation and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage the public trust in our company information security breaches may be very difficult to detect and once detected their impact may be very difficult to assess to date the information security breaches of which we have become aware have been infrequent in occurrence and to the extent we have been able to measure their financial impact on our consolidated results of operations such impact has not been material we have invested and continue to invest to prevent monitor detect and respond to information security breaches by strengthening our employee awareness and training information technology systems and business processes and strengthening data protection requirements for third parties that handle our confidential information however despite these efforts we expect information security breaches to continue and there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent information security breaches that would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 while human pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of drugs affecting our sales volume declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners 

 human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims 

 we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos ®  byetta ®  cymbalta and prozac among other products see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” and item 3 “legal proceedings” for more information on our current product liability litigation because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products 

 pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters mechanical or information technology system failures or inability to obtain solesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given 

the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products see item 1 “business—raw materials and product supply” for more details 

 we rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced these systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to corruption damage or interruption from a variety of sources including energy or telecommunications failures breakdowns natural disasters terrorism war computer malware or other malicious intrusions and random attacks to date system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we have implemented measures to prevent respond to and minimize the impact of system interruptions however there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 we utilize third parties including suppliers alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development the manufacture and commercialization of certain products support for information technology systems and certain financial transactional processes for example we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 the animal health operating segment may be impacted by among other things increased generic competition increased sales of companion animal products by nonveterinarian retail outlets emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets and failure of our research and development acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income 

 we are continuing to integrate into our operations the novartis ah business which we purchased in january 2015 this complex global integration is a multiyear process and could still be disruptive to the ongoing operations of the elanco business or to certain corporate support functions unexpected delays and difficulties in the integration could lead to additional expenses and disruption to ongoing operating results

1  the fda fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs which treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and fill an unmet medical need 

2  the breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of potential medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take over a decade and cost more than 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the us and in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities consequently it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing completion dates and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

novartis animal health acquisition 

on january 1 2015 we completed our acquisition of novartis ah in an allcash transaction for 528 billion  novartis ah operates in approximately 40 countries we acquired novartis ah’s nine manufacturing sites six dedicated research and development facilities a global commercial infrastructure with a portfolio of approximately 600 products a pipeline with more than 40 projects in development and more than 3000 employees the combined organization has increased our animal health product portfolio expanded our global commercial presence and augmented our animal health manufacturing and research and development in particular it has provided elanco with a greater commercial presence in the companion animal and swine markets expanded elanco’s presence in equine and vaccines areas and created an entry into the aquaculture market as a condition to the clearance of the transaction under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act following the closing of the acquisition of novartis ah we divested certain companion animal assets in the us related to the sentinel ®  canine parasiticide franchise to virbac corporation for approximately 410 million the novartis ah business we retained generated revenue of approximately 11 billion in 2014 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings the loss of us patent exclusivity for cymbalta ®  in december 2013 and evista ®  in march 2014 resulted in the immediate entry of generic competitors and a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected products having in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

we lost our data package protection for cymbalta in major european countries in 2014 in 2015 we saw the entry of generic competition in all major european markets the loss of exclusivity for cymbalta in the european markets has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which over time will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows we also lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia indication in december 2015 for zyprexa ®  in japan we will lose our patent protection for the bipolar mania indication in april 2016 for zyprexa in japan generic versions of zyprexa were approved in japan in february 2016 we cannot speculate whether the generic company will apply for pricing and proceed to launch 

additionally as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the alimta ®  vitamin regimen patent which provides us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries and through may 2022 in the us has been challenged in each of these jurisdictions our compound patent for alimta will expire in the us in january 2017 and expired in major european countries and japan in december 2015 we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta into these markets following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows we are aware that a generic competitor has received approval to market a generic version of alimta in a major european country although we are not aware of whether this competitors product has entered the market notwithstanding our patents generic versions of alimta were approved in japan in february 2016 we filed preliminary injunctions against four generic competitors we do not anticipate generic competitors to proceed to launch prior to the completion of the sawai invalidation trial as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

the us compound patent for humalog ®  expired in 2013 thus far the loss of compound patent protection for humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of humalog and to date none have been approved in the us or europe we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop a similar version of humalog and it is difficult to predict the likelihood timing and impact of these products entering the market 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound and the british pound against the euro while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses over the past two years we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuations as the us dollar strengthened compared to several other foreign currencies including the euro british pound and japanese yen while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

united states 

in the us public concern over prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals continues to drive the legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal and state measures may be enacted key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity modifications to medicare parts b and d new language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in part d and statelevel proposals to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and nonhealth care initiatives or to manage federal and state budgets 

in the us private sector consolidation and integration among us healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage the conditions under which drugs are included on a plans formulary and reimbursement the associated outofpocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer outofpocket cost such as nonpreferred copay tiers increased coinsurance levels and higher deductibles consequently pharmaceutical companies compete for formula placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy fewer side effects or greater patient ease of use but also by providing rebates price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations 

the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca are now in effect through both the launch of statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid an emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high outofpocket costs for patients particularly for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market driven in part by aca changes such as the 2020 implementation of the excise tax on employersponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit the socalled cadillac tax continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards qualitybased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products 

tax matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard for example the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries other tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress could change the tax rate and manner in which us companies would be taxed additionally the organisation for economic cooperation and development issued its final recommendations of international tax reform proposals to influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate while outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain changes to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows

revenue 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity by jurisdiction 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

1 us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 

the following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

in the us the volume increase in 2015  was driven by the inclusion of revenue from novartis ah and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products partially offset by the residual impact of the loss of exclusivity for cymbalta and evista 

outside the us the volume increase in 2015  was driven by the inclusion of revenue from novartis ah and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products 

on a pro forma basis which reflects the 2014 revenues of novartis ah as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements our consolidated volume in 2015 would have increased by 2 percent compared with 2014 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2015  compared with 2014  

 2 other pharmaceutical products includes revenue of 1756 million  and 461 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively for erbitux ®  the 2015 revenue is primarily associated with net product revenue from third parties subsequent to the transfer of commercialization rights in the us and canada collectively north america from bristolmyers squibb company and er squibb collectively bms to us in the fourth quarter see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

revenues of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased   7 percent  in the us driven by higher realized prices and to a lesser extent wholesaler buying patterns partially offset by decreased demand revenues outside the us decreased   21 percent  driven by decreased volume primarily due to the loss of a government contract in brazil and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenues of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia decreased   66 percent  in the us due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in december 2013 revenues outside the us decreased   26 percent  driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity in europe in 2014 

revenues of zyprexa a treatment for schizophrenia acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder and bipolar maintenance increased   31 percent  in the us driven by adjustments to the return reserve resulting from the expiration of the period to return expired product for credit revenues outside the us decreased   15 percent  driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates we lost patent exclusivity for zyprexa in japan in december 2015 zyprexa revenues in japan were 4159 million in 2015 compared with 4662 million in 2014 the revenue decrease in japan was due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenues of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder increased   11 percent  in the us   driven by higher realized prices and to a lesser extent increased demand revenues outside the us decreased   1 percent  driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates largely offset by increased volume

revenues of animal health products in the us increased   21 percent  and animal health product revenues outside the us increased   53 percent  the increases were driven by the inclusion of revenue from novartis ah 

on a pro forma basis which reflects the 2014 revenues of novartis ah as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements revenues of animal health products in the us would have decreased 1 percent driven primarily by decreased volume in food animal products revenues outside the us would have decreased 13 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in companion animal products partially offset by higher realized prices and volume for food animal products 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 748 percent  in 2015  essentially flat compared with 2014  as the unfavorable impacts of the inclusion of novartis ah and inventory stepup and amortization costs were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 

research and development expenses increased   1 percent  to 480 billion  in 2015  driven primarily by higher latestage clinical development costs the inclusion of novartis ah and an increase in charges associated with the termination of latestage molecules primarily evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro of approximately 135 million partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased   1 percent  to 653 billion  in 2015  due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 2014 charge associated with the us drug fee partially offset by the inclusion of novartis ah and expenses related to new product launches 

we recognized acquired iprd charges of 5350 million  in 2015  resulting from various collaboration agreements primarily with pfizer as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to locemias intranasal glucagon there were 2002 million  of acquired iprd charges in 2014  related to various collaboration agreements including charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us from boehringer ingelheim of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 3677 million  in 2015  the charges relate to severance costs integration costs for novartis ah and asset impairments in 2014 we recognized charges of 4687 million  for asset impairment restructuring and other special charges the charges included severance costs asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in puerto rico and integration costs for the thenpending acquisition of novartis ah see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 1006 million  in 2015  compared with income of 3405 million  in 2014  other income in 2015  included net gains of 2367 million on investments partially offset by a net charge of 1527 million related to the repurchase of 165 billion of debt other income in 2014  included net gains of 2164 million on investments and 920 million of income associated with the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to boehringer ingelheim see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 137 percent  in 2015  compared with 203 percent  in 2014  the effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of a 1190 million nondeductible charge associated with the us drug fee the decrease in the tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to a favorable tax impact of the net charges related to the repurchase of debt acquired iprd and asset impairment restructuring and other special charges see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

the following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year 

numbers may not add due to rounding 

in the us the volume decrease in 2014  was due to lower demand for cymbalta and evista following patent expirations and to a lesser extent to wholesaler buying patterns 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2014 compared with 2013 



1 us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 

2 collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for erbitux and revenue associated with trajenta 

revenues of alimta increased 2 percent in the us driven by increased volume revenues outside the us increased 5 percent driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices 

revenues of humalog increased 7 percent in the us driven by increased demand partially offset by lower realized prices as a result of payer contracts and greater medicaid and medicare utilization as well as wholesaler buying patterns revenues outside the us increased 6 percent driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent higher realized prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenues of cialis increased 10 percent in the us driven by higher realized prices partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns revenues outside the us increased 3 percent driven by higher realized prices and increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

revenues of cymbalta decreased 89 percent in the us due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in december 2013 revenues outside the us increased 6 percent driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates

revenues of evista decreased 73 percent in the us due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in march 2014 revenues outside the us decreased 24 percent driven primarily by the expiration of a supply agreement in 2013 and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

animal health product revenues in the us increased 4 percent driven by increased volume in food animal products and higher realized prices partially offset by decreased volume in companion animal products due to competitive pressure revenues outside the us increased 16 percent driven by increased volume in food animal products due in part to the acquisition of lohmann se and to a lesser extent higher realized prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 749 percent in 2014 a decrease of 39 percentage points compared with 2013 driven primarily by lower sales of cymbalta and evista following us patent expirations 

research and development expenses decreased 14 percent to 473 billion in 2014 driven primarily by lower latestage clinical development costs research and development expenses in 2013 included 972 million of milestone payments made to boehringer ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin 

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased 7 percent to 662 billion in 2014 driven primarily by the reduction in us sales and marketing activities for cymbalta and evista as well as ongoing cost containment efforts partially offset by an additional 1190 million charge in 2014 associated with the us drug fee an annual nontax deductible fee enacted by the patient protection and affordable care act that is imposed on us and others engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs the final regulations issued by the irs in 2014 accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur this change resulted in the need to expense two years of the us drug fee in 2014 to account for the fee imposed and paid in 2014 and the fee that would be imposed and paid in 2015 

we recognized acquired iprd charges of 2002 million in 2014 resulting from our collaboration agreements with adocia astrazeneca uk limited and immunocore limited in addition to charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us from boehringer ingelheim of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved there were 571 million of acquired iprd charges in 2013 related to the acquisition of rights for the cgrp antibody see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

our effective tax rate was 203 percent in 2014 compared with 205 percent in 2013 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2015  cash and cash equivalents was 367 billion  a decrease of 2052 million  compared with 387 billion  at december 31 2014  refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  

in addition to our cash and cash equivalents we held total investments of 443 billion  and 552 billion  as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

as of december 31 2015  total debt was 798 billion  a slight decrease of 430 million  compared with 802 billion  at december 31 2014  this decrease is due primarily to 268 billion of net repayments of shortterm commercial paper borrowings the repayment of 178 billion of fixedrate notes in connection with the purchase and redemption of certain us dollardenominated notes in june 2015  and to a lesser extent the decrease in fair value of our hedged debt these decreases were largely offset by the issuance of 445 billion of fixedrate notes during 2015  at december 31 2015  we had a total of 130 billion  of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion  of which is available to support our commercial paper program see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowing needs 

for the 130th consecutive year we distributed dividends to our shareholders dividends of 200 per share and 196 per share were paid in 2015  and 2014  respectively in the fourth quarter of 2015  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2016  the quarterly dividend was increased to 051 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2016  of 204 per share 

capital expenditures of 107 billion  during 2015  were 964 million  less than in 2014  we expect 2016  capital expenditures to be approximately 11 billion 

in 2015  we repurchased 7495 million  of shares under the 500 billion  share repurchase program previously announced in october 2013 

see results of operations—executive overview—other matters section for information regarding the actual or anticipated effect of losses of exclusivity for cymbalta us and europe evista us alimta us europe and japan and zyprexa japan 

at december 31 2015  we had an aggregate of 712 billion  of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries a significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the us we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us no accrual for us income taxes is provided we believe cash provided by operating activities in the us and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs dividends paid to shareholders share repurchases and capital expenditures various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in forwardlooking statements and item 1a “risk factors” may however affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2015  and 2014  including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound and the british pound against the euro we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro the british pound and the japanese yen our corporate riskmanagement policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2015  and 2014  would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows 

1   our longterm debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps we used the interest rate forward curve at december 31 2015  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 

2   we have included the following 

 3   we have included longterm liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities we excluded longterm income taxes payable of 8689 million because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2015  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

sales returns  background and uncertainties 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated productsupply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is based on several factors including historical return rates expiration date by product generally 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels among others as well as any other specificallyidentified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity product recalls and discontinuances or a changing competitive environment we maintain a returns policy that allows us pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the products expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires adjustments to the returns reserve may be required in the future based on revised estimates to our assumptions which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of sales we expect the ratio of actual product returns as a percentage of net sales to increase in future periods as we begin to experience elevated return levels for cymbalta following the loss of patent exclusivity in the us market

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid and managed care contracts in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid and managed care rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries an evaluation of the current medicaid and managed care contracts the percentage of our products that are sold via medicaid and managed care contracts and our product pricing although we accrue a liability for medicaid and managed care rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid and managed care rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserves 

financial statement impact 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate 158 million  effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was 87 percent and 88 percent as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us pharmaceutical sales return rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid and managed care 



1  adjustments of the estimates for these returns rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 15 percent  of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

background and uncertainties 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we also consider any thirdparty indemnification to which we are entitled including the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

financial statement impact 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

retirement benefits assumptions 

background and uncertainties 

defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected return on plan assets we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 80 percent  of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

financial statement impact 

if the 2015  discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 429 million  as of january 1 2016 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan costs prior to this change the service and interest costs were determined using a single weightedaverage discount rate based on yield curves of high quality fixed income debt instruments used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period this new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash outflows of our obligations the new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the specific spot yield curve rates the change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs is recorded in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss we will account for this as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016 the decrease in the 2016 service and interest costs is expected to be approximately 110 million compared to the previous method 

if the 2015  expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 227 million  if our assumption regarding the 2015  expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 504 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 75 percent  of both the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at december 31 2015  

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

background and uncertainties 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in the “latestage pipeline” section the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary materially from these estimates 

income taxes 

background and uncertainties 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2015  a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 202 million  and 295 million  respectively 

acquisitions 

background and uncertainties 

to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions qualify as a business combination or as an asset acquisition we make certain judgments which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules this involves determining the inputs processes and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities 

if the acquired set of activities meets the definition of a business assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets where applicable is recorded as goodwill if the acquired set of activities does not meet the definition of a business the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and therefore any acquired iprd that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as well as estimated asset lives can materially affect our consolidated results of operations the fair values of intangible assets including acquired iprd are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management depending on the facts and circumstances we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities 

the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an income method as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities or a discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments including but not limited to revenue and the discount rate 

financial statement impact 

as of december 31 2015  a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of 335 million

financial expectations for 2016   

for the full year of 2016 we expect eps to be in the range of 283 to 293 we anticipate that total revenue will be between 202 billion and 207 billion excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates we expect revenue growth from a number of established products including humalog trajenta cialis forteo strattera erbitux and animal health products as well as higher revenues from new products including cyramza trulicity jardiance portrazza and basaglar we expect this revenue growth to be partially offset by lower revenue from alimta as a result of increased competitive pressures 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 74 percent in 2016 research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of 48 billion to 50 billion other—net income expense is expected to be income of up to 75 million marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 60 billion to 62 billion 

the 2016 tax rate is expected to be approximately 21 percent 

capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 11 billion 

amortization associated with the transfer of erbitux commercialization rights included in our 2016 financial guidance is subject to final acquisition accounting adjustments

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

human pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the us we distribute human pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2014 2013 and 2012 three wholesale distributors in the us—amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 8 percent  and 19 percent  of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major human pharmaceutical products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managed care organizations mcos government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products 

human pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the us we promote our human pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives   while the products marketed vary from country to country endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in total revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries in which we operate we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

human pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our human pharmaceutical products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the us and has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors elanco promotes its products primarily to producers and veterinarians for food animal products and to veterinarians for companion animal products elanco also advertises certain companion animal products directly to pet owners 

competition 

our human pharmaceutical products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors for both human pharmaceutical and animal health products include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products processes and uses most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective human pharmaceutical and animal health products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturers generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic human pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products many of our animal health products also compete with generics 

biosimilars 

several of our current products including cyramza erbitux and reopro and many of the new molecular entities nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a biologic for which marketing approval is granted based on less than a full safety and efficacy package due to the physicalstructural similarity of the biosimilar to an alreadyapproved biologic as well as reliance on the finding of safety and efficacy of the alreadyapproved product globally governments have or are developing regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovatordeveloped biologics but the patent for the existing branded product must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities for example with our partner boehringer ingelheim we have developed a new insulin glargine product which has the same amino acid sequence as the currently marketed product our product has received marketing approval in the eu and tentative approval in the us we intend to begin european launches later in 2015 following expiration of the compound patent for insulin glargine see item 3 legal proceedings for information on legal proceedings relating to this product 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals it is estimated that approximately twothirds of the us population now participates in some version of managed care mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations medicare part d prescription drug plans alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations mcos have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance 

mcos typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered under their plans exclusion of a drug from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their branded products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy fewer side effects or greater patient ease of use a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor price is becoming an increasingly important factor in mco formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the mco has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable as noted above generic drugs typically have lower costs than brandname drugs mcos often favor generics for this reason 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section of item 1 “business” in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceuticals typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which can result in severe and rapid decline in sales of the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

 

 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization more than 140 countries have agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms substantive limitations and ineffectual implementation it is difficult to assess when and how much we will benefit commercially from this protection 

certain of our elanco animal health products are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection historically upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health products we have not generally experienced the rapid and severe declines in revenues that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties sometimes may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses—particularly those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection for our larger or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 

 

 outside the us important patent protection or data protection includes 

 necitumumab our nme that has been submitted for regulatory review is protected by a compound patent 2025 not including possible patent extension and upon us approval would be protected for 12 years by biologics data package protection see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis—latestage pipeline” for more information about this molecule 

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our major products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our largest products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws for human pharmaceuticals before the hatchwaxman act no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie a complete new drug application nda the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative human pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative human pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge for example we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications challenging the vitamin dosage regimen patent for alimta for more information on hatchwaxman litigation involving the company see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” and item 3 legal proceedings 

outside the us the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our alimta vitamin dosage regimen patents in europe and japan see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” 

government regulation 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulations address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal products the impact on humans who consume the food as well as the impact on the environment at the production site the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical products and certain animal health products in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products the us department of agriculture and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the doj and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions including china brazil and the united kingdom have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the us we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our human pharmaceuticals under state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus 43 percent formula drug manufacturers are required to provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceuticals based on the payers assessments of comparative effectiveness and value the us has established the patient centered outcomes research institute pcori a federallyfunded private nonprofit corporation empowered to fund and disseminate comparative effectiveness research cer and build infrastructure for improved outcomes analysis while pcori has no authority to impose formulary changes directly in governmentfunded health programs they are expected to drive an increase in cer studies which payers can use for formulary decisions andor medical societies can use to inform medical guidelines development many countries outside of the us use formal health technology assessment processes to determine formulary placement and purchase price 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical products 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2014  we employed approximately 8145 people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 473 billion  in 2014  553 billion  in 2013  and 528 billion  in 2012  

our internal human pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on our core areas of cancer diabetes and neurodegeneration and two emerging areas immunology and pain we are investing in molecules with multipathway pharmacological efficacy eg dualaction bispecific antibodies and antibodydrug conjugates to expand the potential of our therapeutic portfolio we have a strong biotechnology research program with approximately half of our clinicalstage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients across all our therapeutic areas we are increasingly focusing our efforts on tailored therapeutics seeking to identify and use advanced diagnostic tools and other information to identify specific subgroups of patients for whom our medicines—or potentially those of other companies—will be the best treatment option 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical products we actively seek out external investments in research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technologies and potential products from internal and external sources to meet unmet veterinary needs our animal health scientists also leverage discoveries from our human health laboratories to develop products to enhance the health and wellbeing of livestock and pets 

human pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

 the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological “targets” that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become “lead” molecules and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one such lead molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low 

 the early development phase involves refining lead molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals as necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans the first human tests often referred to as phase i are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose has been established the drug is administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase typically less than 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase normally takes several years to complete 

 product phase phase iii molecules have already demonstrated safety and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

 once a molecule is submitted to regulatory agencies the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 55  drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapies for diabetes various cancers alzheimer’s disease pain highrisk vascular disease rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including molecules targeting various cancers diabetes neurodegeneration pain immunologic diseases anemia cardiovascular disease musculoskeletal disorders and renal diseases we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products see item 7 managements discussion and analysis—latestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

the majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at four owned sites in the us as well as owned sites in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we take a variety of actions including a companywide comprehensive quality system inventory management and backup sites 

however human pharmaceutical and animal health production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that audits and monitors all aspects of quality related to human pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

executive officers of the company 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers except as otherwise noted all executive officers have been employed by the company in management or executive positions during the last five years 

the term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors to be held on may 4 2015 or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified no director or executive officer has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive officer of the company as   that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement there is no understanding between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected

you can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 18 segment information that information is incorporated here by reference 

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated revenue changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations our major product revenues are generally not seasonal

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

 there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market typically takes over a decade and often costs well in excess of 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement limited scope of approved uses difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that   are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial position and prospects 

 we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with drugs see item 1 “business—competition” for more details 

 a number of our topselling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost or will lose in the next several years significant patent protection andor data protection in the united states us as well as key countries outside the us as illustrated in the tables below 





certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for nonbiological products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues for biological products such as humalog humulin and erbitux loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—other matters” and item 1 business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

 our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover develop and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld we face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in sales in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” item 3 legal proceedings and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies for more details 

 in the us prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals congressional investigations into manufacturer’s pricing policies and the federal budget process continue to drive legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal measures may be enacted as a result pharmaceutical companies may see either a reduction in revenue or increase in expenses president obama’s fiscal year 2016 budget includes a number of key health legislative proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals including a reduction in biologic data exclusivity modifications to medicare parts b and d and new language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in part d savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund health care expenditures such as the medicare sustainable growth rate and nonhealth care expenditures state and federal health care proposals including price controls continue to be debated and if implemented could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations 

in the us private sector the growth of managed care organizations mcos is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals it is estimated that approximately twothirds of the us now participates in some form of managed care mcos have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance mcos typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered under their plans exclusion of a drug from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their branded products included price is becoming an increasingly important factor in mco formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the mco has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of opera tions 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products 

we expect pricing reimbursement and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the us to become more severe see item i “business—regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” for more details 

 we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates and results of operations the us and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries there have also been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress that could change the manner in which and rate at which income of us companies would be taxed while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future reform of us taxation including taxation of international income will continue to be a topic of discussion for the us congress and the obama administration additionally the organisation for economic cooperation and development launched and continues to advance an initiative to analyze and potentially influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate a significant change to the us or international tax framework including changes to the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 income taxes for more details 

 as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro chinese yuan and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses 

 the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including lilly have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations and comparable foreign regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures interruption of production leading to product shortages and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues see item 1 “business—regulation of our operations” for more details 

 human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and postmarketing clinical studies may result in product label changes that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after approval for marketing could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims 

 we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily byetta ®  prozac and actos ®  see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” and item 3 “legal proceedings” for more information on our current product liability litigation because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or 

other products in the future which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products 

 pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters or inability to obtain solesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products see item 1 “business—raw materials and product supply” for more details 

 we rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced these systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including energy or telecommunications failures breakdowns natural disasters terrorism war computer malware or other malicious intrusions and random attacks to date system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we have implemented extensive measures to prevent respond to and minimize the impact of system interruptions however there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 a great deal of confidential information owned by both lilly and our alliances is stored in our information systems networks and facilities at third parties this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information some of this information is created accessed andor maintained by third parties the confidentiality of this information may be breached in a variety of ways including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and data or wrongful conduct by certain governments hackers unethical competitors or former workforce members the rapid growth of social media exacerbates the risk of information security breaches 

the theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights cause damage to company operations and reputation and cause us to lose other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage the public trust in our company information security breaches may be very difficult to detect and once detected their impact may be very difficult to assess to date the information security breaches of which we have become aware have been infrequent in occurrence and to the extent we have been able to measure their financial impact on our consolidated results of operations such impact has not been material we have invested and continue to invest to prevent monitor detect and respond to information security breaches by strengthening our employee awareness and training information technology systems and business processes and strengthening data protection requirements for third parties that handle our confidential information however despite these efforts we expect information security breaches to continue and there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent information security breaches that would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 we utilize third parties including suppliers alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development the manufacture and commercialization of certain products support for information technology systems and certain financial 

transactional processes for example we outsource the daytoday management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 the animal health operating segment may be impacted by among other things increased generic competition increased sales of companion animal products by nonveterinarian retail outlets emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets and failure of the research and development acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 

 we are in the process of integrating into our operations the novartis animal health business which we purchased in january 2015 this global integration is complex and potentially disruptive to the ongoing operations of both the ongoing elanco business and the acquired novartis business unexpected delays and difficulties in integrating the two businesses could lead to additional expenses failure to achieve expected operating efficiencies and sales synergies and disruption to ongoing operating results 

 while human pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of drugs affecting our sales volume declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners

other product liability litigation 

we are currently a defendant in a variety of other product liability lawsuits in the united states us 

in october 2012 we were named as a defendant in a purported classaction lawsuit in the us district court for the central district of california  saavedra et al v eli lilly and company  involving cymbalta the plaintiffs assert claims under the consumer protection statutes of four states and seek declaratory injunctive and monetary relief for various alleged economic injuries arising from discontinuing treatment with cymbalta and purported to represent a class of all persons within the us who purchased andor paid for cymbalta in december 2014 the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification plaintiffs have filed a petition with the 9th circuit court of appeals requesting permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of class certification 

additionally we have been named in approximately 45 individual lawsuits filed in various federal courts by claimants alleging injuries arising from discontinuation of treatment with cymbalta counsel for plaintiffs filed a petition seeking to have those cases and an unspecified number of future cases coordinated into a federal multidistrict litigation mdl in the central district of california in december 2014 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation denied the plaintiffs petition for creation of an mdl 

we believe all these cymbalta lawsuits and claims are without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously 

we have been named as a defendant in approximately 105 us product liability lawsuits involving axiron in some of the cases other manufacturers of testosterone are named as codefendants these lawsuits have been consolidated in a federal mdl in the us district court for the northern district of illinois the cases generally allege cardiovascular injuries we believe these claims are without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously 

other patent litigation 

we have filed applications with the us food and drug administration fda and regulators in europe japan and other countries seeking approval to market our new insulin glargine product following the expiration of the compound patent for insulin glargine generally may 2015 in january 2014 sanofiaventis us llc sanofi filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement with respect to our product sanofi asserts infringement of three us patents relating to pen injector devices and two us patents relating to insulin glargine formulations under the hatchwaxman act the initiation of the lawsuit automatically invoked a stay of final fda approval for a period of 30 months until june 2016 which may be shortened in the event of an earlier court decision in our favor in july 2014 sanofi filed a second lawsuit against us in the same court alleging infringement of patents relating to the use of our insulin glargine formulation in a cartridge in august 2014 we received tentative fda approval for our insulin glargine product under the trade name basaglar ®  with final approval subject to the stay described above trials have been scheduled in the district of delaware for september 2015 for the first lawsuit and march 2016 for the second lawsuit 

legal proceedings are also underway in france japan and canada related to various patents asserted by sanofi against our insulin glargine product sanofi has also asserted certain device patents against humalog and humulin pen devices in france and japan in these proceedings proceedings brought in the uk which were related to device patents were resolved in december 2014 with a declaration of noninfringement in favor of lilly 

we do not believe our insulin glargine product infringes any valid claim of the asserted patents and we believe we will prevail in the various proceedings related to the patents 

in canada several generic companies challenged the validity of our zyprexa patent in september 2012 the canadian court of appeals affirmed the lower courts decision that the patent was invalid for lack of utility in 2013 our petition for leave to appeal the decision to the supreme court of canada was denied two of the generic companies apotex inc and teva canada limited pursued claims for damages arising from lilly’s enforcement of the patent under canadian regulations in april 2014 the supreme court of canada dismissed apotexs damages suit tevas claim for damages remains and the total amount of damages that may be awarded to teva will be determined through a separate trial which is scheduled for may 2016 

marketing practices investigations 

in august 2003 we received notice that the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec was conducting an investigation into the compliance by lillys polish subsidiary with the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa subsequently we were notified that the sec had expanded its investigation to other countries and that the department of justice doj was conducting a parallel investigation in december 2012 we announced that we had reached an agreement with the sec to settle its investigation the settlement relates to certain activities of lilly subsidiaries in brazil china poland and russia from 1994 through 2009 without admitting or denying the allegations we consented to pay a civil settlement amount of 294 million and agreed to have an independent compliance consultant conduct a 60day review of our internal controls and compliance program related to the fcpa in january 2015 the doj advised us that they have closed their investigation into this matter 

shareholder derivative litigation 

in 2011 the company received a letter sent on behalf of shareholder kim barovic demanding that the board of directors cause the company to take 1 legal action against certain of its current and former officers and board members for allegedly causing damage to the company by failing to exercise proper oversight over the company’s compliance with the fcpa and 2 all necessary actions to reform and improve certain corporate governance and internal procedures the board established a committee of disinterested directors to consider the demands and determine what action if any the company should take in response in february 2013 following its investigation the committee determined among other things that it would not be in the best interests of the company to take any of the actions demanded by ms barovic 

in august 2013 ms barovic brought a shareholder derivative suit  barovic v lechleiter et al  filed in marion county indiana superior court the suit sought to maintain the action purportedly on behalf of the company against certain current and former directors and officers of the company alleging breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment the company was named in the suit as a nominal defendant the suit did not seek damages from the company but instead requested damages in an unspecified amount and certain equitable relief on the company’s behalf 

in september 2014 following submission by the defendants of a motion to dismiss ms barovic agreed to voluntarily dismiss the suit without prejudice subject to approval by the superior court in october 2014 the superior court ordered the case dismissed without prejudice 

other matters 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund we have been designated as one of several potentially responsible parties with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites under superfund each responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the cleanup 

we are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations including product liability patent employment and premises liability litigation of a character we regard as normal to our business

executive overview 

this section provides an overview of our financial results recent product and latestage pipeline developments and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry earnings per share eps data are presented on a diluted basis 

financial results 

worldwide total revenue decreased   15 percent  to 1962 billion  in 2014  primarily as a result of the loss of united states us patent exclusivity for cymbalta ® in december 2013 and to a lesser extent evista ®  in march 2014 partially offset by volume growth in several other products in 2014  net income decreased   49 percent  to 239 billion  and eps decreased   48 percent  to 223  compared to 2013  net income and eps of 468 billion  and 432  respectively the decreases were due to lower gross margin higher asset impairment restructuring and other special charges and decreased other income partially offset by lower marketing selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses and income tax expense

 the following table reflects the status of each nme within our latestage pipeline including developments since january 1 2014  





there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development rd and the introduction of new products a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the us and in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities consequently it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved 

we manage rd spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total rd spending due to the risks and 

uncertainties involved in the rd process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing completion dates and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our rd projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful rd project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated rd expense while we do accumulate certain rd costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total rd costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

other matters 

subsequent event  novartis animal health acquisition 

on january 1 2015 we completed our acquisition of novartis animal health novartis ah in an allcash transaction for approximately 54 billion novartis ah operates in approximately 40 countries we acquired novartis ah’s nine manufacturing sites six dedicated research and development facilities a global commercial infrastructure with a portfolio of approximately 600 products a pipeline with more than 40 projects in development and more than 3000 employees the combined organization is expected to increase our animal health product portfolio expand our global commercial presence and augment our animal health manufacturing and research and development in particular it is expected to provide elanco with a greater commercial presence in the companion animal and swine markets expand elanco’s presence in equine and vaccines areas and create an entry into the aquaculture market as a condition to the clearance of the transaction under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act following the closing of the acquisition of novartis ah we divested certain companion animal assets in the us related to the sentinel ®  canine parasiticide franchise to virbac corporation for approximately 410 million the novartis ah business we retained generated revenue of approximately 11 billion in 2014 

patent matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings the loss of us patent exclusivity for cymbalta in december 2013 and evista in march 2014 resulted in the immediate entry of generic competitors and a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected products having a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

we lost our data package protection for cymbalta in major european countries in 2014 and we anticipate the entry of generic competition in these countries in 2015 we expect that the entry of generic competition for cymbalta into the markets where it has lost patent protection would cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows we will also lose patent exclusivity in december 2015 for zyprexa ®  in japan 

additionally as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the alimta ®  vitamin dosage regimen patent which provides us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries and through may 2022 in the us has been challenged in each of these jurisdictions our compound patent for alimta will expire in the us in january 2017 and in major european countries and japan in december 2015 we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta into the markets where it has lost patent protection would cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the us compound patent for humalog ®  expired in may 2013 thus far the loss of compound patent protection for humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue to date no biosimilar version of humalog has been approved in the us or europe however we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop biosimilar forms of humalog and it is difficult to predict the likelihood timing and impact of biosimilars entering the market 

foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global company with substantial operations outside the us we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro chinese yuan and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sales and operating expenses in 2014 we saw significant foreign currency rate fluctuations as the us dollar strengthened compared to other foreign currencies including the euro and the japanese yen while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations 

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

united states 

prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals congressional investigations into manufacturer’s pricing policies and the federal budget process continue to drive legislative debate these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal measures may be enacted as a result pharmaceutical companies may see either a reduction in revenue or increase in expenses president obama’s fiscal year 2016 budget includes a number of key health legislative proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals including a reduction in biologic data exclusivity modifications to medicare parts b and d and new language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in part d savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund health care expenditures such as the medicare sustainable growth rate and nonhealth care expenditures state and federal health care proposals including price controls continue to be debated and if implemented could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations 

in the us private sector the growth of managed care organizations mcos is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals it is estimated that approximately twothirds of the us now participates in some form of managed care mco’s have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance mco’s typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered under their plans exclusion of a drug from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their branded products included price is becoming an increasingly important factor in mco formulary decisions particularly in treatment areas in which the mco has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressures could negatively impact future consolidated results of operations 

in 2014 the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act aca took effect through both the launch of statebased exchanges and the expansion of medicaid an emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high outofpocket costs for patients particularly for pharmaceuticals in addition to the coverage expansions many employers in the commercial market driven in part by changes resulting from the aca continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumerdriven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards qualitybased reimbursement and the launch of several valuebased purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven realworld outcomes data and a favorable economic profile 

international 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations costcontainment measures exist in a number of countries including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products 

tax matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions changes in the relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the us and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard for example the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and other tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress could change the tax rate and manner in which us companies would be taxed additionally the organisation for economic cooperation and development launched and continues to advance an initiative to analyze and potentially influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate while outcomes of these initiatives are uncertain changes to key elements of the us or international tax framework could have a material effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows

operating results— 2014   

revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2014  was 1962 billion  a decline of 15 percent  compared with 2013  this decrease was comprised of 13 percent  due to volume 2 percent  due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and 1 percent  due to lower prices numbers do not add due to rounding total revenue in the us decreased   29 percent  to 913 billion  due to lower demand for cymbalta and evista following patent expirations and to a lesser extent to wholesaler buying patterns revenue outside the us increased   3 percent  to 1048 billion  due to increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2014  compared with 2013  



 

sales of alimta a treatment for various cancers increased   2 percent  in the us driven by increased volume sales outside the us increased   5 percent  driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices 

sales of humalog our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes increased   7 percent  in the us driven by increased demand partially offset by lower net effective selling prices as a result of payer contracts and greater medicaid and medicare utilization as well as wholesaler buying patterns sales outside the us increased   6 percent  driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent higher prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia increased   10 percent  in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns sales outside the us increased   3 percent  driven by higher prices and increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder and in the us for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia decreased   89 percent  in the us due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in december 2013 sales outside the us increased   6 percent  driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased   5 percent  in the us primarily driven by increased demand partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns sales outside the us increased   8 percent  driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women increased   5 percent  in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased volume sales outside the us increased   7 percent  driven by increased volume primarily in japan partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates primarily the japanese yen 

sales of zyprexa a treatment for schizophrenia acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder and bipolar maintenance decreased   3 percent  in the us sales outside the us decreased   14 percent  driven by decreased volume the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates primarily the japanese yen and lower prices we will lose patent exclusivity for zyprexa in japan in december 2015 zyprexa sales in japan were approximately 465 million in 2014 compared to approximately 510 million in 2013 

sales of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder increased   1 percent  in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased volume sales outside the us increased   9 percent  driven by increased volume primarily in japan partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates primarily the japanese yen 

sales of effient a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an arteryopening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention including patients undergoing angioplasty atherectomy or stent placement increased   5 percent  in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns sales outside the us decreased   3 percent  driven by lower volume 

sales of evista a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer decreased   73 percent  in the us due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in march 2014 sales outside the us decreased   24 percent  driven primarily by the expiration of a supply agreement in 2013 and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

animal health product sales in the us increased   4 percent  driven by increased volume in food animal products and higher prices partially offset by decreased volume in companion animal products due to competitive pressure sales outside the us increased   16 percent  driven by increased volume in food animal products due in part to the acquisition of lohmann se lohmann ah and to a lesser extent higher prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 749 percent  in 2014  a decrease of 39  percentage points compared with 2013  driven primarily by lower sales of cymbalta and evista following us patent expirations 

research and development expenses decreased   14 percent  to 473 billion  in 2014  driven primarily by lower latestage clinical development costs research and development expenses in 2013  included 972 million  of milestone payments made to boehringer ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin 

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased   7 percent  to 662 billion  in 2014  driven primarily by the reduction in us sales and marketing activities for cymbalta and evista as well as ongoing cost containment efforts partially offset by an additional 1190 million charge in 2014  associated with the us drug fee an annual nontax deductible fee enacted by the patient protection and affordable care act that is imposed on us and others engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs the final regulations issued by the irs in 2014 accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur this change affected all entities conducting covered activities in 2014 and resulted in the need to expense two years of the us drug fee in 2014 to account for the fee imposed and paid in 2014 and the fee that will be imposed and paid in 2015 

we recognized acquired iprd charges of 2002 million  in 2014  resulting from our collaboration agreements with adocia astrazeneca and immunocore limited in addition to charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us from boehringer ingelheim of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it is not yet approved there were 571 million  of acquired iprd charges in 2013  related to the acquisition of rights for the cgrp antibody see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 4687 million  in 2014  these charges included 2255 million  of severance costs related to ongoing efforts to reduce our cost structure and global workforce and 2432 million  of asset impairment and other special charges consisting primarily of a 1808 million  asset impairment charge related to our decision to close and sell a manufacturing plant located in puerto rico in 2013 we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 1206 million  these charges included 300 million  of asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a packaging and distribution facility in germany and 906 million  of severance costs to reduce our cost structure and global workforce see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 3405 million  in 2014  compared with income of 5189 million  in 2013  other income in 2014  included net gains of 2164 million on investments and 920 million of income related to the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to boehringer ingelheim other income in 2013  was primarily comprised of 4954 million  related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with amylin see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 203 percent  in 2014  compared with 205 percent  in 2013  see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

operating results— 2013 

financial results 

worldwide total revenue increased 2 percent to 2311 billion in 2013 driven by growth in several products including cialis humalog trajenta alimta forteo and animal health products partially offset by the continued erosion of zyprexa sales following the loss of patent exclusivity in the us and most major markets outside japan in 2013 net income increased 15 percent to 468 billion and eps increased 18 percent to 432 compared to 2012 net income and eps of 409 billion and 366 respectively the increases were due to higher gross margin lower marketing selling and administrative expenses and to a lesser extent a lower effective tax rate partially offset by higher research and development expenses and lower other income eps in 2013 also benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs 

the 2013 highlighted items are summarized in the executive overview section the 2012 highlighted items are summarized as follows

 asset impairment restructuring and other special charges note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

 revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2013 was 2311 billion a 2 percent increase compared with 2012 as an increase of 5 percent due to higher prices was partially offset by a decrease of 2 percent due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 1 percent decrease due to lower volume total revenue in the us increased 5 percent to 1289 billion due to higher prices partially offset by volume declines for cymbalta and zyprexa due to the loss of patent exclusivity revenue outside the us decreased 1 percent to 1022 billion due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the continued weakness of the japanese yen and to a lesser extent lower prices partially offset by increased volume 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2013 compared with 2012 



 sales of cymbalta increased 1 percent in the us driven by higher prices largely offset by lower demand due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in december 2013 sales outside the us increased 4 percent driven primarily by increased volume partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of alimta increased 8 percent in the us due to higher prices and increased demand sales outside the us increased 1 percent driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices 

sales of humalog increased 11 percent in the us driven by higher prices wholesaler buying patterns and increased demand sales outside the us increased 6 percent driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cialis increased 21 percent in the us driven by higher prices sales outside the us increased 6 percent driven by higher prices and increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of humulin increased 14 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased demand sales outside the us decreased 1 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased volume 

sales of forteo increased 5 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent due to increased volume primarily in japan partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of zyprexa decreased 66 percent in the us due to continued erosion following patent expiration in late 2011 sales outside the us decreased 20 percent driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates lower volume in markets outside of japan and lower prices 

sales of evista increased 10 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased demand sales outside the us decreased 10 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices partially offset by increased volume in japan 

sales of strattera increased 16 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent driven primarily by increased volume in japan partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of effient increased 11 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 12 percent driven primarily by increased volume 

animal health product sales in the us increased 6 percent driven primarily by increased volume for trifexis ®  and to a lesser extent higher prices sales outside the us increased 6 percent driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent higher prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue remained at 788 percent in 2013 as higher prices were offset by the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold which significantly decreased the cost of sales in 2012 

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent to 713 billion in 2013 driven primarily by lower selling and marketing expenses resulting from ongoing costcontainment efforts including a reduction in us sales and marketing activities in anticipation of the loss of patent exclusivity for cymbalta and evista as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates 

research and development expenses increased 5 percent to 553 billion in 2013 due to higher research and clinical development expenses including 972 million of milestone payments made to boehringer ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin 

we recognized an acquired iprd charge of 571 million in 2013 resulting from our acquisition of a cgrp antibody there were no acquired iprd charges in 2012 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 1206 million in 2013 these charges included 300 million of asset impairments primarily associated with the anticipated closure of a packaging and distribution facility in germany and 906 million of severance costs to reduce our cost structure and global workforce in 2012 we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 2811 million these charges included 1226 million related to an intangible asset impairment for liprotamase 745 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 640 million related to the asset impairment of a delivery device platform and 200 million related to the withdrawal of xigris see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 5189 million in 2013 compared with income of 6740 million in 2012 the decrease was driven primarily by lower income related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with amylin of 4954 million in 2013 compared with 7878 million in 2012 partially offset by milestone payments received from boehringer ingelheim for regulatory submissions in the us europe and japan see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 205 percent in 2013 compared with 244 percent in 2012 the 2012 effective tax rate reflected the expiration of the rd tax credit at the end of 2011 and the tax impact of the payment received from amylin partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase the decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate reflects the reinstatement of the rd tax credit in the us effective january 1 2013 as well as the onetime impact of the reinstatement of the rd tax credit for 2012 that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2014  cash and cash equivalents remained essentially unchanged at 387 billion  compared with 383 billion  at december 31 2013  significant sources of cash included cash flows from 

operations of 437 billion  net proceeds from investment transactions of 362 billion  and net proceeds from the issuance of short and longterm debt of 264 billion  significant uses of cash included dividends paid of 210 billion  purchases of property and equipment of 116 billion  share repurchases of 8000 million  and the acquisition of lohmann ah which amounted to 5514 million  we also held 541 billion  of cash in escrow associated with the pending close of the novartis ah acquisition which was reflected as restricted cash as of december 31 2014  in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of novartis ah for approximately 54 billion in an allcash transaction see executive overview—other matters for additional details 

in addition to our cash and cash equivalents we held total investments of 552 billion  and 919 billion  as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

as of december 31 2014  total debt was 806 billion  an increase of 284 billion  compared with 521 billion  at december 31 2013  the increase is due primarily to the increase in shortterm commercial paper borrowings of 268 billion  used primarily to finance the acquisition of novartis ah at december 31 2014  we had a total of 331 billion  of unused committed bank credit facilities 320 billion  of which is available to support our commercial paper program subject to market conditions we intend to replace the majority of our commercial paper borrowings with fixedrate long term notes in the first half of 2015 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowing needs 

for the 130th consecutive year we distributed dividends to our shareholders dividends of 196 per share were paid in both 2014  and 2013  in the fourth quarter of   2014  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of   2015  the quarterly dividend was increased t o 050 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2015  of 200 per share 

capital expenditures of 116 billion  during 2014  were 1505 million  more than in 2013  we expect 2015  capital expenditures to be approximately 13 billion 

in 2014  we repurchased 8000 million  of shares under the 500 billion  share repurchase program previously announced in october 2013 

see executive overview—other matters for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection for cymbalta us and europe evista us alimta us europe and japan and zyprexa japan 

at december 31 2014  we had an aggregate of 854 billion  of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries a significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the united states we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us no accrual for us income taxes is provided we believe cash provided by operating activities in the us and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs dividends paid to shareholders share repurchases and capital expenditures various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in forwardlooking statements and item 1a “risk factors” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2014  and 2013  including derivatives and other interest 

rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro chinese yuan and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face foreign currency exchange exposures primarily when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro the british pound and the japanese yen our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities we analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31 2014  and 2013  would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or financial position over a oneyear period this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 



 the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2014  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated productsupply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network 

redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is based on several factors including historical return rates expiration date by product generally 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels among others as well as any other specificallyidentified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity product recalls and discontinuances or a changing competitive environment we maintain a returns policy that allows us pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the products expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires adjustments to the returns reserve may be required in the future based on revised estimates to our assumptions which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of sales we expect the ratio of actual product returns as a percentage of net sales to increase in future periods as we begin to experience elevated return levels for cymbalta following the recent loss of patent exclusivity in the us market 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid and managed care contracts in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid and managed care rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries an evaluation of the current medicaid and managed care contracts the percentage of our products that are sold via medicaid and managed care contracts and our product pricing although we accrue a liability for medicaid and managed care rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid and managed care rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserves 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014  a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability would lead to an approximate 137 million effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was 88 percent as of december 31 2014  and 2013  

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us sales return rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid and managed care in millions 



 product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products in addition to insurance coverage we also consider any thirdparty indemnification we have including the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected rate of return we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 85 percent  of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

if the healthcarecost trend rates were to increase by one percentage point the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2014  annual expense would increase by 78 million  a onepercentagepoint decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2014  service cost and interest cost by 66 million  if the 2014  discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 354 million  if the 2014  expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 217 million  if our assumption regarding the 2014  expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 499 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 80 percent  of both the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at december 31 2014  

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired iprd all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size patent protection historical pricing of similar products and expected industry trends the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate this analysis is performed for each project independently 

for acquired iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in the “latestage pipeline” section the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some acquired iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

income taxes 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

as of december 31 2014  a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 319 million  and 301 million  respectively

financial expectations for 2015   

for the full year of 2015 we expect eps to be in the range of 240 to 250 we anticipate that total revenue will be between 195 billion and 200 billion the acquisition of novartis ah is expected to add significant revenue 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 750 percent in 2015 marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 65 billion to 68 billion research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of 47 billion to 49 billion reflecting an expected increase in phase iii trial expenses and the inclusion of novartis ah other—net income expense is expected to be in a range between 75 million and 125 million of income 

the 2015 tax rate is expected to be approximately 185 percent assuming a fullyear 2015 benefit of the research and development tax credit and other tax provisions up for extension if these items are not extended the 2015 tax rate would be approximately 15 percentage points higher the 2015 expected tax rate includes the tax impact of costs associated with the novartis ah and lohmann ah acquisitions and amortization of intangibles 

capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 13 billion 

our 2015 financial guidance does not include a potential charge related to the collaboration with pfizer to develop and commercialize tanezumab if the partial clinical hold for the molecule is removed and we and pfizer move forward with development we will pay a 200 million upfront fee to pfizer this charge would reduce eps by approximately 012 and would cause our tax rate to be approximately 10 percentage point lower

business 

tableend eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” or lilly was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and market products in two business segments—human pharmaceutical products and animal health products 

the mission of our human pharmaceutical business is to make medicines that help people live longer healthier more active lives our strategy is to create value for all our stakeholders by accelerating the flow of innovative new medicines that provide improved outcomes for individual patients most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover develop and bring to market innovative new medicines 

our animal health business operating through our elanco division develops manufactures and markets products for both food animals and companion animals 

we manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the united states puerto rico and 11 other countries our products are sold in approximately 120 countries 

human pharmaceutical products 

our human pharmaceutical products include 

endocrinology products  including 

 neuroscience products  including 

 

 oncology products  including

marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

human pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the us we distribute human pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2013 2012 and 2011 three wholesale distributors in the us—amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 10 percent  and 19 percent  of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major human pharmaceutical products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managedcare organizations mcos government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on lilly products 

human pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the us we promote our human pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in total revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales organizations but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors 

human pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our human pharmaceutical products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the us and has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors elanco promotes its products primarily to producers and veterinarians for food animal products and to veterinarians for companion animal products elanco also advertises certain companion animal products directly to pet owners 

competition 

our human pharmaceutical products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors for both human pharmaceutical and animal health products include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products and processes most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to decreased sales progressive price reductions or both 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective human pharmaceutical and animal health products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

generic pharmaceuticals 

one of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals in the us and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceuticals other than biological products biologics exempts generics from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturers generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when a branded nonbiologic human pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products many of our animal health products also compete with generics 

biosimilars 

some of our current products including humalog humulin erbitux and reopro and many of the new molecular entities in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of followon biologics also known as biosimilars a biosimilar is a biologic for which marketing approval would be granted based on less than a full safety and efficacy package due to the physicalstructural similarity of the biosimilar to an alreadyapproved biologic as well as reliance on the finding of safety and efficacy of the alreadyapproved product globally governments have or are developing regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovatordeveloped biologics but the patent for the existing branded product must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

managed care organizations 

the growth of mcos in the us is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals it is estimated that approximately twothirds of the us population now participates in some version of managed care mcos can include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations medicare part d prescription drug plans alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations mcos have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance to us 

to successfully compete for business with mcos we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other medicines or other forms of care as noted above generic drugs are exempt from costly and timeconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and as such typically have lower costs than brandname drugs mcos that focus primarily on 

the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics for this reason many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brandname drugs in their healthcare programs laws in the us generally allow and in many cases require pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brandname drug the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it 

mcos typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered under their plans exclusion of a drug from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included where possible companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products such as greater efficacy fewer side effects or greater patient ease of use a lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not always successful in having our major products included on mco formularies 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes in addition as discussed below for some products we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section of item 1 “business” in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceuticals typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which can result in severe and rapid decline in sales of the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

 

the base period of data package protection is five years in the us 12 years for new biologics as described below ten years in the eu and eight years in japan the period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent 

 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto more than 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms substantive limitations and ineffectual implementation it is difficult to assess when and how much we will benefit commercially from this protection 

certain of our elanco animal health products are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection in general upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health products we have not experienced the rapid and severe declines in revenues that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties sometimes may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses—particularly those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data protection for our larger or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 

 

 outside the us important patent protection or data protection includes 

 us patent protection or data protection for our new molecular entities that have been submitted for regulatory review is as follows additional information about these molecules is provided in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis—latestage pipeline” 

 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our major products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our largest products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others 

 

countries covered by a relevant patent the agreement is subject to termination for material default and failure to cure by lilly and in the event that lilly becomes bankrupt or insolvent 

patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws for human pharmaceuticals before the hatchwaxman act no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie a complete new drug application nda the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative human pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative human pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications challenging the vitamin dosage regimen patent for alimta for more information on this litigation see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 16 contingencies” 

outside the united states the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our alimta vitamin dosage regimen patents in europe see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 16 contingencies” 

government regulation 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulations address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal products the impact on humans who consume the food as well as the impact on the environment at the production site the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical products and certain animal health products in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products the us department of agriculture usda and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency ema in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulations however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals certain of our products are manufactured by third parties and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the doj and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information regarding a corporate integrity agreement entered into by lilly in connection with the resolution of a us federal marketing practices investigation and certain related state investigations involving zyprexa 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa the sec and the doj have increased their fcpa enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information about a secdoj investigation under the fcpa involving our operations in several countries 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions including china brazil and the uk have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities andor increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the united states government and governmentfunded healthcare programs often impose direct and indirect price controls we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our human pharmaceuticals under state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs minimum of 231 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities no rebates are required at this time in the medicare part b 

physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus 43 percent formula drug manufacturers are required to provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 

rebates are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class 

in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls international reference pricing to other countries’ prices discounts and rebates therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choices restrictions on physician prescription levels and mandatory generic substitution 

globally public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceuticals based on the payers assessments of comparative effectiveness and value the us has established the patient centered outcomes research institute pcori a federallyfunded private nonprofit corporation empowered to fund and disseminate comparative effectiveness research and build infrastructure for improved outcomes analysis while pcori has no authority to impose formulary changes directly in governmentfunded health programs they are expected to drive an increase in cer studies which payers can use for formulary decisions andor medical societies can use to inform medical guidelines development many countries outside of the us use formal health technology assessment hta processes to determine formulary placement and purchase price 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical products 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2013 we employed approximately 7850 people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 553 billion  in 2013  528 billion  in 2012  and 502 billion  in 2011  

our human pharmaceutical research and development focuses on five therapeutic categories cancer endocrine diseases including diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders central nervous system and related diseases autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are also investing in molecules with multipathway pharmacological efficacy to expand the potential of our therapeutic portfolio we have a strong biotechnology research program with approximately half of our clinicalstage pipeline and more than half of our latestage pipeline currently consisting of biotechnology molecules in addition to discovering and developing new molecular entities we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients across all our therapeutic areas we are increasingly focusing our efforts on tailored therapeutics seeking to identify and use advanced diagnostic tools and other information to identify specific subgroups of patients for whom our medicines—or those of other companies—will be the best treatment option 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including academic institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical products we actively seek out external investments in research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own efforts these investments 

can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technologies and potential products from internal and external sources to meet unmet veterinary needs our animal health scientists also leverage discoveries from our human health laboratories to develop products to enhance the health and wellbeing of livestock and pets 

human pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical products 

phases of new drug development 

 the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological “targets” that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become “lead” molecules and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one such lead molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low 

 the early development phase involves refining lead molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals as necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans the first human tests often referred to as phase i are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose has been established the drug is administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase typically less than 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase normally takes several years to complete 

 product phase phase iii molecules have already demonstrated safety and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

 once a molecule is submitted the time to final marketing approval can vary from six months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data 

presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 60  drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval are potential therapies for diabetes various cancers alzheimer’s disease pain highrisk vascular disease rheumatoid arthritis lupus psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including molecules targeting various cancers diabetes alzheimer’s disease depression pain migraine bipolar disorder anemia cardiovascular disease musculoskeletal disorders renal diseases lupus and crohns disease we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products including axiron cialis effient humalog and trajenta see item 7 managements discussion and analysislatestage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidates 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally have sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

we produce most of our products in our own facilities our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at four owned sites in the us as well as owned sites in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand to maintain a stable supply of our products we take a variety of actions including a companywide comprehensive quality system inventory management and backup sites 

however human pharmaceutical and animal health production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that audits 

and monitors all aspects of quality related to human pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

executive officers of the company

employees 

at the end of 2013 we employed approximately 37925  people including approximately 21425 employees outside the united states a substantial number of our employees have long records of continuous service 

financial information relating to business segments and classes of products 

you can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 19 segment information that information is incorporated here by reference 

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated revenue changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

 there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market typically takes a decade or more and often costs well in excess of 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and payer reimbursement limited scope of approved uses difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others regulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products 

we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products or whether our products once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing 

products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies failure to do so in the shortterm or longterm would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial position and prospects 

 we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies to compete successfully we must continue to deliver to the market innovative costeffective products that meet important medical needs our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products and by generic versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products see item 1 “business—competition” for more details 

 a number of our topselling human pharmaceutical products recently have lost or will lose in the next several years significant patent protection andor data protection in the us as well as key countries outside the united states as illustrated in the tables below 





for nonbiological products loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues for biological products such as humalog humulin and erbitux loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the nearterm entry of competitor versions ie biosimilars due to development timelines manufacturing challenges andor uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—legal regulatory and other matters” and item 1 business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights for more details 

 our longterm success depends on our ability to continually discover develop and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market 

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld we face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in sales in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 16 contingencies for more details 

 the continuing prominence of us budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies’ revenue or increase expenses may be enacted certain federal and state health care proposals including state price controls continue to be debated and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices the medicare independent payment advisory board established under the affordable care and patient protection act is empowered to recommend cost reduction policies under certain circumstances these proposals if implemented could negatively affect revenues 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations proposals for costcontainment measures are pending in a number of countries including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectualproperty protection such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of continued austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries and the desire to manage health expenses carefully even as economies recover in addition governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding the country’s health care system offerings some governments may adopt a genericsonly policy which reduces current and future access to our human pharmaceutical products others may use some of the approaches to restrict pricing reimbursement and access outlined above 

we expect pricing reimbursement and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the us to become more severe see item i “business—regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access” for more details 

 the marketing promotional and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers prescribers and patients are subject to extensive regulation many companies including lilly have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authorities private payers and consumers these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies including exclusion from us federal and other health care programs in addition regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations and comparable foreign regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures interruption of production leading to product shortages and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services that requires us to maintain comprehensive compliance programs governing our research manufacturing and sales and marketing of pharmaceuticals a material failure to comply with the agreement could result in severe sanctions to the company see item 1 “business—regulation of our operations” for more details 

 human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration after approval the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients we and others including regulatory agencies and private payers collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products in addition we or others may conduct postmarketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products new safety or efficacy data from these sources may result in product label changes that could reduce the products market acceptance and result in declining sales serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after approval for marketing could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims 

 we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily byetta ®  darvon ™  prozac and actos ®  see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 16 contingencies” and item 3 “legal proceedings” for more information on our current product liability litigation because of the nature of pharmaceutical products we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and if involving marketed products could adversely affect sales of the product due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products 

 pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities could result in product shortages leading to lost revenue such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems natural disasters or inability to obtain solesource raw or intermediate materials in addition given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products see item 1 “business—raw materials and product supply” for more details 

 we rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced these systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including energy or telecommunications failures breakdowns natural disasters terrorism war computer malware or other malicious intrusions and random attacks to date system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations we have implemented extensive measures to prevent respond to and minimize the impact of system interruptions however there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 a great deal of sensitive confidential data is stored in our information systems and networks including valuable trade secrets and intellectual property corporate strategic plans marketing plans customer information and personally identifiable information such as employee and patient information some of this information is created accessed andor maintained by third parties the confidentiality of this information may be breached through malicious intrusions by private or governmental actors through human or electronic means including “hacking” or “cyberattacks” or through negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and data the rapid growth of social media exacerbates the risk of confidentiality breaches unauthorized disclosure of trade secret information could impair our ability to secure and maintain patent rights and cause us to lose other competitive advantages unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage the public trust in our company breaches of our data 

security may be very difficult to detect and once detected their impact may be very difficult to assess to date the data security breaches of which we have become aware have been infrequent in occurrence and to the extent we have been able to measure their financial impact on our consolidated results of operations such impact has not been material we have invested and continue to invest to prevent monitor detect and respond to data security breaches by strengthening our information technology systems business processes and training and strengthening data protection requirements for third parties that hold our confidential information however despite these efforts we expect data security breaches to continue and there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent data security breaches that would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 we utilize third parties including suppliers alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for selected aspects of product development the manufacture and commercialization of certain products support for information technology systems and certain financial transactional processes outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce results in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 the animal health operating segment may be impacted by among other things increased generic competition emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in foodproducing animals perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising processing or consumption of foodproducing animals an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets and failure of the research and development acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 

 while human pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of drugs affecting our sales volume declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization additionally some customers including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products also if our customers suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties we could experience slower customer collections greater bad debt expense and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners 

 changes in tax laws including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates and settlements of federal state and foreign tax audits can affect our results of operations the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies there have also been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress that could change the manner in which and rate at which income of us companies would be taxed while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future reform of us taxation including taxation of international income will continue to be a topic of discussion for the us congress and the obama administration a significant change to the us tax system including changes to the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

executive overview 

this section provides an overview of our financial results recent product and latestage pipeline developments and legal regulatory and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry earnings per share eps data is presented on a diluted basis 

financial results 

worldwide total revenue increased 2 percent  to 2311 billion  in 2013  driven by growth in several products including cialis ®  humalog ®  trajenta ®  alimta ®  forteo ®  and animal health products partially offset by the continued erosion of zyprexa ®  sales following the loss of patent exclusivity in the us and most major markets outside japan in 2013  net income increased 15 percent to 468 billion  and eps increased 18 percent to 432  compared to 2012  net income and eps of 409 billion  and 366  respectively the increases were due to higher gross margin lower marketing selling and administrative expenses and to a lesser extent a lower effective tax rate partially offset by higher research and development expenses and lower other income eps in 2013  also benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding compared to 2012  as a result of our share repurchase programs

 the following are latestage pipeline updates since january 1 2013 

basal insulin peglispro —in january 2013 we announced plans for the 2013 and 2014 initiation of the remainder of the preplanned clinical trials for the molecule these studies will be conducted to support regulatory submissions and evaluate safety efficacy and differentiation of the molecule these studies are in addition to the five ongoing imagine clinical trials 

dulaglutide —in april 2013 we announced that the phase iii award2 and award4 trials studying dulaglutide as an investigational onceweekly treatment for type 2 diabetes met the primary endpoints related to reduction in hemoglobin a1c hba1c compared to insulin glargine and that the 15 mg dose demonstrated statistically superior reduction in hba1c from baseline compared to insulin glargine in both trials in the third quarter of 2013 we filed for regulatory review in both the us and europe 

edivoxetine —in december 2013 we announced the decision to stop development of edivoxetine as an addon treatment for depression due to lack of efficacy in three acute randomized placebocontrolled phase iii studies the decision was not based on safety concerns 

empagliflozin —in january 2013 we announced positive topline results for four completed phase iii clinical trials studying empagliflozin for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in all four studies the primary efficacy endpoint defined as significant change in hba1c from baseline compared to placebo was met with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg taken once daily the pivotal studies for empagliflozin were completed in 2012 in the first quarter of 2013 boehringer ingelheim filed for regulatory review in both the us and europe the boehringer ingelheim manufacturing facility where empagliflozin is being produced is subject to an fda warning letter however it is not clear if this will impact the timing of fda action for empagliflozin in the fourth quarter of 2013 boehringer ingelheim filed for regulatory review in japan 

enzastaurin —in may 2013 we announced the decision to stop development of enzastaurin as a result of negative clinical trial results from the phase iii prelude study which explored the molecule as a monotherapy in the prevention of relapse for patients with diffuse large bcell lymphoma 

ixekizumab —in january 2013 we initiated phase iii clinical trial testing for ixekizumab as a potential treatment for psoriatic arthritis 

liprotamase —in december 2013 we made the decision to discontinue further development of liprotamase 

necitumumab —in august 2013 we announced that the phase iii study squire met its primary endpoint finding that patients with stage iv metastatic squamous nsclc experienced increased overall survival when administered necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as a firstline treatment as compared to chemotherapy alone we anticipate filing for regulatory review before the end of 2014 

new insulin glargine product —in july 2013 we and boehringer ingelheim announced that the marketing authorization application for our new insulin glargine product filed in june 2013 through the biosimilar pathway was accepted for review by the european medicines agency in the fourth quarter of 2013 we filed for regulatory review in the us and japan 

in january 2014 sanofiaventis us llc sanofi filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement with respect to our insulin glargine product for which we are seeking approval from the fda sanofi asserts infringement of two patents relating to pen injector devices and two patents relating to insulin glargine formulations under the hatchwaxman act the initiation of the lawsuit automatically invokes a stay of fda approval of the product for a period of 30 months which may be shortened in the event of an earlier decision in our favor we believe the lawsuit is without merit and we are prepared to vigorously defend against the allegations 

ramucirumab —our rolling submission to the fda for ramucirumab as a singleagent biologic therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer following progression on prior chemotherapy was completed in the third quarter of 2013 and received priority review status by the fda in october 2013 our regulatory submission in europe for the same indication was also completed in the third quarter of 2013 in september 2013 we announced that the rainbow trial a global phase iii study of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and a secondary endpoint of improved progressionfree survival we intend to submit an application for this indication to regulatory authorities in 2014 in september 2013 we also announced that a separate global phase iii study of ramucirumab in women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer rose did not meet its primary endpoint of 

progressionfree survival we do not plan to submit an application to regulatory authorities for ramucirumab in the firstline treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic her2negative breast cancer based on the results from the rose study in february 2014 we announced that the revel trial a global phase iii study of ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapy docetaxel in patients with secondline nsclc met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and a secondary endpoint of improved progressionfree survival we intend to submit the first application for this indication to regulatory authorities in 2014 

tabalumab —in february 2013 we announced our decision to discontinue the phase iii rheumatoid arthritis program for tabalumab due to lack of efficacy the decision was not based on safety concerns the tabalumab phase iii program for lupus is continuing as planned 

tanezumab —in october 2013 we entered into a collaboration agreement with pfizer to jointly develop and globally commercialize tanezumab for the potential treatment of osteoarthritis pain chronic low back pain and cancer pain tanezumab is currently in phase iii clinical development and is subject to a partial clinical hold by the fda pending submission of nonclinical data to the fda pfizer anticipates submitting that data in 2014 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development rd and the introduction of new products a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the us and other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities consequently it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products 

we manage rd spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total rd spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the rd process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing completion dates and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our rd projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful rd project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated rd expense while we do accumulate certain rd costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total rd costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

legal regulatory and other matters 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings cymbalta ®  lost patent exclusivity in the us in december 2013 resulting in the immediate entry of several generic competitors we also expect the loss of us patent protection for evista ®  in march 2014 to result in immediate generic competition we will lose our data package protection for cymbalta in major european countries in 2014 however we do not anticipate the entry of generic competition in most of these countries until 2015 the entry of generic competition in each of these markets is expected to cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected products having a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

the us compound patent for humalog expired in may 2013 the loss of compound patent protection for humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue to date no biosimilar version of humalog has been approved in the us or europe however we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop biosimilar forms of humalog and it is difficult to predict the likelihood timing and impact of biosimilars entering the market 

the continuing prominence of us budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies’ revenue 

or increase expenses may be enacted certain federal and state health care proposals including state price controls continue to be debated and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices these federal and state proposals or state price pressures could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations proposals for costcontainment measures are pending in a number of countries including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectualproperty protection such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of continued austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries the desire to manage health expenses carefully even as economies recover and the effort in some countries to expand access to health care coverage while seeking savings from the biopharmaceutical sector 

the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies there also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress that could change the manner in which and the rate at which income of us companies would be taxed while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future reform of us taxation including taxation of international income will continue to be a topic of discussion for congress and the obama administration a significant change to the us tax system including changes to the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in addition the organization for economic cooperation and development recently launched an initiative to analyze and potentially influence international tax policy in the major countries in which we operate while the outcomes of this initiative are uncertain significant changes to key elements of the global international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

operating results— 2013   

revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2013  increased 2 percent  to 2311 billion  compared with 2012  as an increase of 5 percent due to higher prices was partially offset by a decrease of 2 percent due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 1 percent decrease due to lower volume total revenue in the us increased 5 percent  to 1289 billion  due to higher prices partially offset by volume declines for cymbalta and zyprexa due to the loss of patent exclusivity revenue outside the us decreased 1 percent  to 1022 billion  due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the continued weakness of the japanese yen and to a lesser extent lower prices partially offset by increased volume 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2013  compared with 2012  



 sales of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder and in the us for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia increased 1 percent in the us driven by higher prices largely offset by lower demand due to the loss of us patent exclusivity in december 2013 which is causing rapid and severe declines in our cymbalta sales sales outside the us increased 4 percent driven primarily by increased volume partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

we will lose effective exclusivity for cymbalta in major european countries upon expiration of our data package protection in 2014 however because generic manufacturers cannot file for regulatory approval until after our data package protection expires we do not anticipate the entry of generic competition in most of these countries until 2015 while it is difficult to predict the precise impact on cymbalta sales we expect the introduction of generics in these markets to result in a rapid and severe decline in our cymbalta sales which will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

 sales of alimta a treatment for various cancers increased 8 percent in the us due to higher prices and increased demand sales outside the us increased 1 percent driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices 

sales of humalog our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes increased 11 percent in the us driven by higher prices wholesaler buying patterns and increased demand sales outside the us increased 6 percent driven by increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia bph increased 21 percent in the us driven by higher prices sales outside the us increased 6 percent driven by higher prices and increased volume partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased 14 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased demand sales outside the us decreased 1 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased volume 

sales of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women increased 5 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent due to increased volume primarily in japan partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of zyprexa a treatment for schizophrenia acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder and bipolar maintenance decreased 66 percent in the us due to the continued erosion following patent expiration in 2011 sales outside the us decreased 20 percent driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates lower volume in markets outside of japan and lower prices zyprexa sales in japan were approximately 510 million in 2013 compared to approximately 585 million in 2012 and were negatively impacted by the continued weakness of the japanese yen 

sales of evista a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer increased 10 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased demand sales outside the us decreased 10 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices partially offset by increased volume in japan 

we will lose effective patent exclusivity for evista in the us on march 2 2014 we expect generic competition immediately following the loss of exclusivity while it is difficult to predict the precise impact on evista sales we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our us evista sales which will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

sales of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder increased 16 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent driven primarily by increased volume in japan partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of effient a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an arteryopening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention including patients undergoing angioplasty atherectomy or stent placement increased 11 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 12 percent driven primarily by increased volume 

animal health product sales in the us increased 6 percent driven primarily by increased volume for trifexis ®  and to a lesser extent higher prices sales outside the us increased 6 percent driven by increased volume and to a lesser extent higher prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue remained at 788 percent in 2013  as higher prices were offset by the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold which significantly decreased the cost of sales in 2012 

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent  to 713 billion  in 2013  driven primarily by lower selling and marketing expenses resulting from ongoing costcontainment efforts including the previously announced reduction in us sales and marketing activities in anticipation of the loss of patent exclusivity for cymbalta and evista as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates 

research and development expenses increased 5 percent  to 553 billion  in 2013  due to higher research and clinical development expenses including 972 million  of milestone payments made to boehringer ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin 

we recognized an acquired iprd charge of 571 million  in 2013  resulting from our acquisition of a cgrp antibody currently being studied as a potential treatment for the prevention of frequent recurrent migraine headaches following a successful phase ii proofofconcept study there were no  acquired iprd charges in 2012  see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 1206 million  in 2013  these charges included 300 million of asset impairments primarily associated with the anticipated closure of a packaging and distribution facility in germany and 906 million of severance costs to reduce our cost structure and global workforce in 2012 we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 2811 million  these charges included 1226 million related to an intangible asset impairment for 

liprotamase 745 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 640 million related to the asset impairment of a delivery device platform and 200 million related to the withdrawal of xigris see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 5189 million  in 2013  compared with income of 6740 million  in 2012  the decrease was driven primarily by lower income related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with amylin of 4954 million  in 2013 compared with 7878 million  in 2012 partially offset by milestone payments received from boehringer ingelheim for regulatory submissions in the us europe and japan see notes 4 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 205 percent  in 2013  compared with 244 percent  in 2012  the 2012 effective tax rate reflected the expiration of the rd tax credit at the end of 2011 and the tax impact of the payment received from amylin partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase the decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate reflects the reinstatement of the rd tax credit in the us effective january 1 2013 as well as the onetime impact of the reinstatement of the rd tax credit for 2012 that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2012 decreased 7 percent to 2260 billion driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in most major markets partially offset by growth in cymbalta forteo effient alimta and our animal health portfolio worldwide sales volume decreased 7 percent and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue decline partially offset by an increase of 2 percent due to higher prices the decrease in volume was driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in most major markets partially offset by volume gains for certain other products total revenue in the us decreased 5 percent to 1231 billion due to the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa partially offset by higher prices and increased demand for certain other products revenue outside the us decreased 9 percent to 1029 billion driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in markets outside of japan the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates and lower prices partially offset by increased demand for certain other products 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2012  compared with 2011  



 sales of cymbalta increased 23 percent in the us due to higher prices and to a lesser extent increased demand sales outside the us increased 9 percent driven by increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of alimta increased 13 percent in the us driven by increased demand and higher prices sales outside the us remained flat as increased demand was offset by lower prices in japan and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of humalog decreased 2 percent in the us due to increased government and commercial rebates as well as the products removal from a large formulary in 2012 sales outside the us increased 6 percent due to increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cialis increased 11 percent in the us driven by increased demand and higher prices sales outside the us decreased 2 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased demand and higher prices 

sales of zyprexa decreased 83 percent in the united states sales outside the us decreased 45 percent the decreases were due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the us and most major international markets outside of japan partially offset by growth in japan zyprexa sales in japan were approximately 585 million in 2012 compared to approximately 540 million in 2011 

sales of humulin increased 1 percent in the us driven by higher prices largely offset by decreased demand us sales of humulin were negatively affected by the products removal from a large formulary in 2012 as well as the continued decline in the market for human insulin and the termination of the humulin relion agreement with walmart sales outside the us decreased 2 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased volume 

sales of forteo increased 8 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased volume sales outside the us increased 33 percent primarily due to the increased demand in japan 

sales of evista decreased 1 percent in the us driven by decreased demand largely offset by higher prices sales outside the us decreased 14 percent driven by decreased volume and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of strattera decreased 2 percent in the us due to decreased demand partially offset by higher prices sales outside the us increased 4 percent driven by increased demand in japan partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of effient increased 52 percent in the us driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices sales outside the us increased 47 percent due to increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

animal health product sales in the us increased 30 percent primarily due to increased demand for companion animal products sales outside the us increased 12 percent driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain janssen animal health assets in europe see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and the growth of other products partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 03 percentage points in 2012 to 788 percent this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of zyprexa and to a lesser extent higher miscellaneous manufacturing costs partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold which decreased cost of sales in 2012 and increased cost of sales in 2011 

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent in 2012 to 751 billion driven by lower marketing expense resulting from our costcontainment efforts research and development expenses increased 5 percent to 528 billion due to higher latestage clinical trial costs 

no acquired iprd charges were incurred in 2012 compared with 3880 million in 2011 all of which was associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 2811 million in 2012 these charges comprised 1226 million related to an intangible asset impairment for liprotamase 745 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 640 million related to the asset impairment of a delivery device platform and 200 million related to the withdrawal of xigris in 2011 we recognized asset impairment restructuring and other special charges of 4014 million of which 3164 million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions and 850 million related to the withdrawal of xigris see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 6740 million in 2012 compared with expense of 1790 million in 2011 the increase was driven by income of 7878 million recognized from the early payment of the exenatide revenuesharing obligation by amylin see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 244 percent in 2012 compared with 187 percent in 2011 the increase in 2012 reflects the tax impact of the payment received from amylin and the expiration of the research and development tax credit at the end of 2011 partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase the effective tax rate for 2011 was lower due to a tax benefit on the iprd charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim as well as a benefit from the resolution in 2011 of the irs audits of tax years 20052007 along with certain matters related to 20082009 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2013  cash and cash equivalents decreased to 383 billion  compared with 402 billion  at december 31 2012  as cash flow from operations of 574 billion  was more than offset by dividends paid of 212 billion  share repurchases of 170 billion  net purchases of investments of 102 billion  and purchases of property and equipment of 101 billion  in addition to our cash and cash equivalents we held total investments of 919 billion  and 798 billion  as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

as of december 31 2013  total debt was 521 billion  a decrease of 3184 million  compared with 553 billion  at december 31 2012  the decrease is due primarily to the decrease in fair value of our hedged debt we intend to refinance 100 billion of debt that is maturing in march 2014 a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the anticipated refinancing has been hedged through the use of forwardstarting interest rate swaps see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details we currently have 136 billion  of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion  of which backs our commercial paper program 

capital expenditures of 101 billion  during 2013  were 1067 million  more than in 2012  we expect 2014  capital expenditures to be approximately 13 billion as we invest in the longterm growth of our diabetescare product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality productivity and capability of our manufacturing research and development facilities 

for the 129th consecutive year we distributed dividend payments to our shareholders dividends of 196 per share were paid in both 2013  and 2012  in the fourth quarter of 2013  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2014  the quarterly dividend was maintained at 049 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2014  of 196 per share 

during 2013 we repurchased the remaining 110 billion  of shares associated with our 150 billion  share repurchase program announced in 2012 in october 2013 we announced a new 500 billion share repurchase program which will be completed over time we purchased 5000 million  of shares under the new repurchase program in 2013  

at december 31 2013 we had an aggregate of 1161 billion  of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries a significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the united states we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us no accrual for us income taxes is provided we believe cash provided by operating activities in the us and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs dividends paid to shareholders share repurchases and capital expenditures various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in forwardlooking statements and item 1a “risk factors” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

in december 2013 we lost us patent protection for cymbalta in 2014 we will lose us patent protection for evista and data package protection for cymbalta in major european countries see executive overview—legal regulatory and other matters for additional information 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation and various international government funding levels 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2013  and 2012  including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from 

translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro the british pound and the japanese yen our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2013  and 2012  a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 4 collaborations for additional details these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 



 the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2013  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major 

wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated productsupply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is based on several factors including historical return rates expiration date by product generally 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels among others as well as any other specificallyidentified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity product recalls and discontinuances or a changing competitive environment we maintain a returns policy that allows us pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the products expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires additional adjustments to the returns reserve may be required in the future based on revised estimates to our assumptions which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product returns have been less than 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of sales however we expect the ratio of actual product returns as a percentage of net sales to increase in future periods as we begin to experience elevated return levels for both zyprexa and cymbalta following the recent losses of patent exclusivity for these products in several major markets 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserves 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet a 5 percent change in our global 

sales return rebate and discount liability at december 31 2013  would lead to an approximate 138 million effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was 88 percent and 83 percent as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us sales return rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 



 product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are selfinsured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected rate of return we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 80 percent  of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

if the healthcarecost trend rates were to increase by one percentage point the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2013  annual expense would increase by 94 million  a onepercentagepoint decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2013  service cost and interest cost by 76 million  if the 2013  discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 406 million  if the 2013  expected return on plan assets for us plans were to change by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 201 million  if our assumption regarding the 2013  expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 576 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 80 percent  of both the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at december 31 2013  

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the iprd acquired in a business combination all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size patent protection historical pricing of similar products and expected industry trends the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate this analysis is performed for each project independently 

for iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in the “latestage pipeline” section the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

estimates of future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

income taxes 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in 

evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

as of december 31 2013  a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 262 million  and 324 million  respectively

financial expectations for 2014   

for the full year of 2014 we expect eps to be in the range of 277 to 285 eps expectations for 2014 reflect completed share repurchases in 2013 and potential share repurchases in 2014 we anticipate that total revenue will be between 192 billion and 198 billion patent expirations are expected to drive a rapid and severe decline in us sales of cymbalta and evista these revenue declines are expected to be partially offset by growth from a portfolio of other products including humalog trajenta cialis forteo and alimta as well as our animal health business in addition strong revenue growth is expected in china while a weaker japanese yen is expected to dampen revenue growth in japan 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 74 percent in 2014 marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 62 billion to 65 billion research and development expense is expected to be in the range of 44 billion to 47 billion other—net income expense is expected to be in a range between 100 million and 200 million of income benefited by gains of 150 million to 200 million on the sale of equity investments acquired as part of past business development transactions operating cash flows are expected to be sufficient to pay our dividend of approximately 21 billion allow for capital expenditures of approximately 13 billion and fund potential business development activity and share repurchases 

our 2014 financial guidance does not include a potential charge related to the collaboration with pfizer to develop and commercialize tanezumab if the partial clinical hold for the molecule is removed and we and pfizer move forward with development we will pay a 200 million upfront fee to pfizer this charge would reduce eps by approximately 012

business 

tableend eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” or lilly was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and market products in two business segments—human pharmaceutical products and animal health products 

the mission of our human pharmaceutical business is to make medicines that help people live longer healthier more active lives our strategy is to create value for all our stakeholders by accelerating the flow of innovative new medicines that provide improved outcomes for individual patients most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover develop and bring to market innovative new medicines 

our animal health business operating through the elanco animal health division develops manufactures and markets products for both food and companion animals 

we manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the united states puerto rico and 11 other countries our products are sold in approximately 130 countries

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

human pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the us we distribute human pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2012 2011 and 2010 three wholesale distributors in the us—amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 10 percent  and 16 percent  of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the us through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain websites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies we have entered into arrangements with many of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on lilly products 

human pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the us we promote our human pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in total revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales organizations but in some countries we market our products through independent distributors 

human pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our human pharmaceutical products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 

terminate the collaboration commercial operations were transferred to amylin in the us at the end of november 2011 outside the us we anticipate transferring responsibility for commercialization of exenatide to amylin in substantially all markets by the end of the first quarter of 2013 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4 collaborations” for more information on the november 2011 agreement 

 animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the us and has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors elanco promotes its products primarily to producers and veterinarians for food animal products and to veterinarians for companion animal products elanco also advertises certain companion animal products directly to pet owners 

competition 

our human pharmaceutical products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors include safety effectiveness and ease of use of our products price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products and processes most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions decreased sales volume or both increasingly to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers managed care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers we must demonstrate that our human pharmaceuticals offer not only medical benefits but also more value as compared with other forms of care 

manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals invest far less than we do in research and development and typically have lower manufacturing cost structures therefore they can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when our branded pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products many of our animal health products also compete with generics 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective human pharmaceuticals and animal health products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes 

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section of item 1 “business” in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 loss of patent protection for human pharmaceuticals typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which can result in severe and rapid decline in sales of the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

 

yet entirely clear and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing 

 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto more than 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms and substantive limitations it is difficult to assess when and how much we will benefit commercially from this protection 

certain of our elanco animal health products are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection in general upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health products we have not experienced the rapid and severe declines in revenues that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties sometimes may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses—particularly those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data package protection for our larger or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 

 

 outside the us important patent or data package protection includes 

 us patent protection or data package protection for our new molecular entity that has been submitted for regulatory review is as follows additional information about this molecule is provided in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis—latestage pipeline” 

 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our major products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our larger products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others 

 patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws for human pharmaceuticals before the hatchwaxman act no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie a complete new drug application nda the hatchwaxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative human pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative human pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on alimta for more information on this litigation see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data —note 15 contingencies” 

outside the united states the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue for more information on challenges to our alimta patent protection in europe see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 15 contingencies” 

government regulation 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulations address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal products the impact on humans who consume the food as well as the impact on the environment at the production site the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical products and certain animal health products in the us and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of those products the us department of agriculture usda and the us environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceuticals under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency ema in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other us federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing 

kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the doj and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities over this period several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information regarding a corporate integrity agreement entered into by lilly in connection with the resolution of a us federal marketing practices investigation and certain related state investigations involving zyprexa 

the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa recently the sec and the doj have increased their fcpa enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information about a secdoj investigation involving our operations in several countries 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities and increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of our human pharmaceuticals under state medicaid programs and to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities we also give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare additional costcontainment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

the 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act brought significant changes to us health care the minimum statutory rebate for branded prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries increased from 151 percent to 231 percent this rebate has been expanded to managedmedicaid a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies additionally a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in 340b facilities has been expanded drug manufacturers are required to provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—legal regulatory and other matters” for more discussion of us health 

care reform at the state level budget pressures are causing various states to impose costcontrol measures such as higher rebates and more restrictive formularies 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection recently several governments have implemented acrosstheboard price cuts of branded human pharmaceuticals as part of austerity measures in the face of the global financial crisis and severe national budget deficits 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could negatively affect our pricing and rebates 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2012  we employed approximately 7700 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 528 billion  in 2012  502 billion  in 2011  and 488 billion  in 2010  

our human pharmaceutical research and development focuses on five therapeutic categories cancer endocrine diseases including diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders central nervous system and related diseases autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are also investing in molecules with multipathway pharmacological efficacy to expand the potential of our therapeutic portfolio we have a strong biotechnology research program with approximately half of our clinicalstage pipeline and more than half of our latestage pipeline currently consisting of biotechnology molecules in addition to discovering and developing new molecular entities we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients across all our therapeutic areas we are increasingly focusing our efforts on tailored therapeutics seeking to identify and use advanced diagnostic tools and other information to identify specific subgroups of patients for whom our medicines—or those of other companies—will be the best treatment option 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technologies and potential products from internal and external sources to meet unmet veterinary needs our animal health scientists leverage discoveries from our human health laboratories to develop products to enhance the health and wellbeing of livestock and pets 

human pharmaceutical development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies to collect and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes the new drug research and development process in more detail 

phases of new drug development 

discovery research phase 

the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological “targets” that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become “lead” molecules and go on to the next phase of development the probability of any one such lead molecule completing the rest of the drug development process and becoming a product is extremely low 

early development phase 

the early development phase involves refining lead molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans the first human tests often referred to as phase i are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose has been established the drug is administered to small populations of patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase typically less than 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase normally takes several years to complete 

product phase 

product phase phase iii molecules have already demonstrated safety and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four years 

submission phase 

once a molecule is submitted the time to final marketing approval can vary from six months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 60  drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules in the product 

phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval are potential therapies for diabetes various cancers alzheimer’s disease highrisk vascular disease rheumatoid arthritis lupus psoriasis depression and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including molecules targeting various cancers diabetes alzheimer’s disease depression migraine anemia cardiovascular disease musculoskeletal disorders renal diseases osteoarthritis pain and bipolar disorder we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products including alimta axiron cialis effient erbitux and humalog 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally have sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

our active ingredient manufacturing occurs at four owned sites in the us as well as owned sites in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including formulation filling assembling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world in 2010 we sold our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site in west lafayette indiana to an affiliate of evonik industries ag and entered into a nineyear supply and services agreement whereby evonik manufactures final and intermediatestep active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain lilly human pharmaceutical and animal health products 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures process modifications and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines 

quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and lilly standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that audits and monitors all aspects of quality related to human pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

executive officers of the company 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers except as otherwise noted all executive officers have been employed by the company in management or executive positions during the last five years

you can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—segment information that information is incorporated here by reference 

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated revenue changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations our major product revenues are generally not seasonal 

financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations 

you can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference to date our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by local restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad including the availability of us dollar exchange we cannot predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign operations including possible nationalization might have on our future operations or what other restrictions may be imposed in the 

future in addition changing currency values can either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position liquidity and results of operations we mitigate foreign exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign currency contracts

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

 intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our 

human pharmaceutical patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” for more details we face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” for more details

the following latestage pipeline developments have occurred since january 1 2012 

baricitinib —in november 2012 we initiated phase iii clinical trial testing 

dulaglutide —in october 2012 we announced positive topline results of three completed phase iii award trials award1 award3 and award5 studying dulaglutide as a onceweekly treatment for type 2 diabetes the primary efficacy endpoints as measured by reduction in hemoglobin a1c hba1c at the 15 mg dose were met in all three studies having met the primary endpoints superiority for hba1c lowering was examined and both doses of dulaglutide 075 mg and 15 mg demonstrated statistically superior reduction in hba1c from baseline compared to exenatide twicedaily injection at 26 weeks award1 metformin at 26 weeks award3 and sitagliptin at 52 weeks award5 we anticipate filing for regulatory review in the us and europe in 2013

novel basal insulin analog —in january 2013 we announced that we and boehringer ingelheim adjusted the scope of our collaboration resulting in our reassuming the sole worldwide development and commercialization rights for the novel basal insulin analog we also announced plans for the 2013 and 2014 initiation of the remainder of the preplanned clinical trials for the molecule these studies will be conducted to support regulatory submissions and evaluate safety efficacy and differentiation of the molecule these studies are in addition to the five ongoing imagine clinical trials 

pomaglumetad methionil —in august 2012 we announced the decision to stop ongoing phase iii clinical studies investigating pomaglumetad methionil for the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia the decision was based on a lack of efficacy in two registration trials the decision was not based on any safety signals 

ramucirumab —in october 2012 we announced that the regard trial a phase iii study of ramucirumab as a secondline treatment in patients with metastatic gastric cancer met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and its secondary endpoint of increased progressionfree survival we anticipate filing for regulatory review in the us and europe in 2013 

solanezumab —in august 2012 we announced that the primary endpoints both cognitive and functional were not met in either of the two phase iii doubleblind placebocontrolled expedition trials in patients with mildtomoderate alzheimers disease however a prespecified secondary analysis of pooled data across both trials showed a 34 percent reduction of cognitive decline in patients with mild alzheimers disease we plan to conduct an additional phase iii study of solanezumab in patients with mild alzheimers disease enrollment is expected to begin no later than the third quarter of 2013 

tabalumab —in february 2013 we announced our decision to discontinue the phase iii rheumatoid arthritis program for tabalumab due to lack of efficacy the decision was not based on safety concerns the tabalumab phase iii program for lupus is ongoing and will continue as planned 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development rd and the introduction of new products a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities consequently it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products 

we manage rd spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total rd spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the rd process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing completion dates and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our rd projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful rd project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated rd expense while we do accumulate certain rd costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total rd costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category 

legal regulatory and other matters 

we will lose us patent protection for cymbalta in december 2013 and for evista in march 2014 see financial condition for additional information 

the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 brought significant changes to us health care these changes began to affect our financial results in 2010 and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future beginning in 2011 pharmaceutical drug manufacturers provided a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the doughnut hole the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally beginning in 2011 a nontaxdeductible annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs this fee is allocated to companies based on their priorcalendaryear market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs we recognized 1707 million  and 1780 million  as marketing selling and administrative expense related to this fee for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

the continuing prominence of us budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes fees rebates or other federal measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies’ revenue or increase expenses may be enacted certain other federal and state health care proposals including state price controls continue to be debated and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices these federal and state proposals or state price pressures could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations proposals for costcontainment measures are pending in a number of countries including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectualproperty protection such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries 

the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies there also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress that could change the manner in which and the rate at which income of us companies would be taxed while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future reform of us taxation including taxation of international income will continue to be a topic of discussion for congress and the obama administration a significant change to the us tax system including changes to the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

operating results— 2012   

revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2012  decreased 7 percent  to 2260 billion  driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in most major markets partially offset by growth in cymbalta forteo effient alimta and our animal health portfolio worldwide sales volume decreased 7 percent and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue decline partially offset by an increase of 2 percent due to higher prices the decrease in volume was driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in most major markets partially offset by volume gains for certain other products total revenue in the us decreased 5 percent  to 1231 billion  due to the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa partially offset by higher prices and increased demand for certain other products revenue outside the us decreased 9 percent  to 1029 billion  driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in markets outside of japan the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates and lower prices partially offset by increased demand for certain other products 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2012  compared with 2011  



 sales of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder and in the us for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia increased 23 percent in the us due to higher prices and to a lesser extent increased demand sales outside the us increased 9 percent driven by increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates we will lose effective exclusivity for cymbalta in the us in december 2013 several manufacturers have received tentative approvals to market generic duloxetine and we expect generic duloxetine to be introduced in the market immediately following the loss of exclusivity while it is difficult to predict the precise impact on cymbalta sales we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our cymbalta sales which will have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 

sales of alimta a treatment for various cancers increased 13 percent in the us driven by increased demand and higher prices sales outside the us remained flat as increased demand was offset by lower prices in japan and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of humalog our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes decreased 2 percent in the us due to increased government and commercial rebates as well as the products removal from a large formulary in 2012 sales outside the us increased 6 percent due to increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia bph increased 11 percent in the us driven by increased demand and higher prices sales outside the us decreased 2 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased demand and higher prices 

sales of zyprexa a treatment for schizophrenia acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder and bipolar maintenance decreased 83 percent in the united states sales outside the us decreased 45 percent the decreases were due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the us and most major international markets outside of japan partially offset by growth in japan zyprexa sales in japan were approximately 585 million in 2012 compared to approximately 540 million in 2011 

sales of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased 1 percent in the us driven by higher prices largely offset by decreased demand us sales of humulin were negatively affected by the products removal from a large formulary in 2012 as well as the continued decline in the market for human insulin and the termination of the humulin relion agreement with walmart sales outside the us decreased 2 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased volume 

sales of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men increased 8 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased volume sales outside the us increased 33 percent primarily due to the increased demand in japan 

sales of evista a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer decreased 1 percent in the us driven by decreased demand largely offset by higher prices sales outside the us decreased 14 percent driven by decreased volume and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder in children adolescents and in the us in adults decreased 2 percent in the us due to decreased demand partially offset by higher prices sales outside the us increased 4 percent driven by increased demand in japan partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of effient a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an arteryopening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention including patients undergoing angioplasty atherectomy or stent placement increased 52 percent in the us driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices sales outside the us increased 47 percent due to increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

animal health product sales in the us increased 30 percent primarily due to increased demand for companion animal products sales outside the us increased 12 percent driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain janssen animal health assets in europe see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and the growth of other products partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 03 percentage points in 2012  to 788 percent this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of zyprexa and to a lesser extent higher miscellaneous manufacturing costs partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold which decreased cost of sales in 2012  and increased cost of sales in 2011  

marketing selling and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent  in 2012  to 751 billion  driven by lower marketing expense resulting from our costcontainment efforts research and development expenses increased 5 percent  to 528 billion  due to higher latestage clinical trial costs 

no  acquired iprd charges were incurred in 2012  compared with 3880 million  in 2011  all of which was associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim we recognized asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 2811 million  in 2012  these charges comprised 1226 million related to an intangible asset impairment for liprotamase 745 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 640 million related to the asset impairment of a product delivery device platform and 200 million related to the withdrawal of xigris in 2011 we recognized asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 4014 million  of which 3164 million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions and 850 million related to the withdrawal of xigris see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net income expense was income of 6740 million  in 2012  compared with expense of 1790 million  in 2011  the increase was driven by income of 7878 million recognized from the early payment of the exenatide revenuesharing obligation by amylin see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 244 percent  in 2012  compared with 187 percent  in 2011  the increase in 2012 reflects the tax impact of the payment received from amylin and the expiration of the research and development tax credit at the end of 2011 partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase the effective tax rate for 2011 was lower due to a tax benefit on the iprd charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim as well as a benefit from the resolution in 2011 of the irs audits of tax years 20052007 along with certain matters related to 20082009 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

we achieved revenue growth of 5 percent to 2429 billion in 2011  primarily driven by the collective growth of cymbalta insulin products animal health products alimta effient and cialis partially offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity this revenue growth as well as a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by lower gross margin percentage increased marketing selling and administrative costs higher other expense and the increased impact in 2011 of the items noted below as a result net income decreased 14 percent to 435 billion and eps decreased 15 percent to 390 per share in 2011  as compared to 507 billion or 458 per share in 2010  in addition to the highlighted items summarized in the executive overview 2011  results also included the following items that affect comparisons

 revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2011  increased 5 percent to 2429 billion driven by the collective growth of cymbalta insulin products animal health products alimta effient and cialis partially offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity worldwide sales volume increased 6 percent and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue growth partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to lower prices the increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of us patent exclusivity for zyprexa and gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine revenue in the us increased 1 percent to 1298 billion due to higher volume partially offset by lower prices revenue outside the us increased 11 percent to 1131 billion due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices total revenue was reduced by 4088 million in 2011 due to the impact of us health care reform compared to a reduction of 2290 million in 2010 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2011  compared with 2010  



 sales of zyprexa decreased 13 percent in the us due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the us on october 23 2011 despite a decline in demand for branded zyprexa us volume increased in 2011 primarily as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine in connection with our sixmonth agreement with prasco laboratories this volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to branded zyprexa and authorized olanzapine sales outside the us decreased 3 percent driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity throughout most major markets outside of japan during 2011 partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in japan 

sales of cymbalta increased 14 percent in the us driven primarily by increased demand and higher prices sales outside the us increased 44 percent driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of alimta increased 4 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices and increased demand sales outside the us increased 17 percent due to increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of humalog increased 14 percent in the us due to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices sales outside the us increased 16 percent driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cialis increased 7 percent in the us primarily due to higher prices sales outside the us increased 12 percent driven by increased demand the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices 

sales of humulin increased 25 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices for humulin and increased demand attributable to humulin relion sales outside the us increased 7 percent due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices 

sales of evista increased 4 percent in the us due to higher prices partially offset by decreased demand sales outside the us increased 5 percent driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent increased demand partially offset by lower prices 

sales of forteo decreased 9 percent in the us driven by lower demand partially offset by higher prices sales outside the us increased 50 percent primarily due to increased demand in japan 

sales of strattera increased 1 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices partially offset by lower demand sales outside the us increased 22 percent driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices 

sales of gemzar a product approved to treat various cancers decreased 90 percent in the us due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition which began in november 2010 following the expiration of the compound patent sales outside the us decreased 10 percent due to generic competition in most major markets 

prior to the termination of our exenatide collaboration with amylin in november 2011 we recognized in revenue our 50 percent share of byettas gross margin in the united states in december 2011 we recognized a pro rata portion of revenue resulting from the termination agreement in 2011  we recognized total exenatide revenue of 4227 million a decrease of 2 percent 

animal health product sales in the us increased 16 percent due primarily to increased demand sales outside the us increased 27 percent driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain janssen and pfizer animal health assets in europe and to a lesser extent increased demand for other products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 20 percentage points in 2011  to 791 percent this decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold which significantly increased cost of sales in 2011 but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in 2010 patent expirations for zyprexa and gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent 

marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2011  to 788 billion the increase was driven by the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates in addition higher administrative expenses in the us included 1780 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with us health care reform investment in research and development increased 3 percent to 502 billion due primarily to increased latestage clinical trial costs including costs related to the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 

we incurred an iprd charge of 3880 million in 2011  associated with our diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim compared with 500 million in 2010  associated with the inlicensing agreement with acrux we recognized asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 4014 million in 2011  including charges of 3164 million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions to reduce our cost structure and global workforce and a special charge of 850 million related to the withdrawal of xigris in 2010 we recognized charges totaling 1920 million for asset impairments restructuring and other special charges see notes 3 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net expense increased 1740 million to an expense of 1790 million in 2011  due primarily to impairments of acquired iprd assets in 2011 and damages recovered in 2010 from generic pharmaceutical companies related to zyprexa patent litigation in germany see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate was 187 percent in 2011  compared with 223 percent in 2010  the decrease was due to the tax benefit on the iprd charge associated with the boehringer ingelheim diabetes collaboration as well as a benefit from the resolution in 2011 of the irs audits of tax years 20052007 along with certain matters related to 20082009 additionally the tax rate for 2010 was increased by a onetime charge associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of us health care reform see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2012  cash and cash equivalents totaled 402 billion  compared with 592 billion  at december 31 2011  the decrease was driven by net purchases of 326 billion in investment securities with maturities extending beyond one year dividends paid of 219 billion  the maturity and repayment of longterm debt of 150 billion purchases of property and equipment of 9054 million  and common stock repurchases of 7211 million  partially offset by cash from operations of 530 billion  and 138 billion in proceeds from the early payment of amylins revenuesharing obligations and loan 

capital expenditures of 9054 million  during 2012  were 2334 million  more than in 2011  we expect 2013  capital expenditures to be approximately 900 million as we invest in the longterm growth of our diabetescare product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality productivity and capability of our manufacturing research and development facilities 

as of december 31 2012  total debt was 553 billion  a decrease of 146 billion  compared with 699 billion  at december 31 2011  the decrease is due primarily to the previously mentioned longterm debt maturity and payment of 150 billion our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s remain aa and a2 respectively our ratings outlook from both moody’s and standard  poor’s is stable 

dividends of 196 per share were paid in 2012  and 2011  2012  was the 128th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments in the fourth quarter of 2012  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2013  the quarterly dividend was maintained at 049 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2013  of 196 per share 

both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign governmentbacked agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation the federal governments involvement in the us economy and various international government funding levels we continue to focus specifically on the economic health of the european economy as heightened economic concerns persist currently we believe economic conditions in europe will not have a material impact on our liquidity 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including dividends share repurchases capital expenditures and contractual maturities due on debt in 2013  we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowings we currently have 136 billion  of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion  of which backs our commercial paper program various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in forwardlooking statements and item 1a “risk factors” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectualproperty protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings through 2014 we expect to lose us patent protection for cymbalta december 2013 and evista march 2014 the loss of exclusivity for cymbalta and evista will likely result in generic competition generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product and having a material adverse effect on our results of operations the us patent for humalog expires in may 2013 humalog is currently protected in europe only by formulation patents we do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue to date no biosimilar version of humalog has been approved in the us or europe however we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop biosimilar forms of humalog and it is difficult to predict the likelihood timing and impact of biosimilars entering the market our goal is to mitigate the effect of these exclusivity losses on our operations liquidity and financial position through growth in our patentprotected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period in the emerging markets in japan and in our animal health business our expected growth in the emerging markets and japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of patentprotected products 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2012  and 2011  including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro the british pound and the japanese yen our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2012  and 2011  a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively would not have a material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 



 the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2012  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a 

consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated productsupply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product returns have been less than 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserves 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet a 5 percent change in our global sales return rebate and discount liability at december 31 2012  would lead to an approximate 108 million effect on our income before income taxes 

the portion of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was 83 percent and 82 percent as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us sales return rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 



 product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we have been and will continue to be largely selfinsured for product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans we use an actuarially determined planspecific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates in evaluating the expected rate of return we consider many factors with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions asset returns and asset allocations approximately 80 percent  of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results as well as the discount rates expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates of other companies where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2012  annual expense would increase by 156 million  a one 

percentagepoint decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2012  service cost and interest cost by 126 million  if the 2012  discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 352 million  if the 2012  expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 197 million  if our assumption regarding the 2012  expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 436 million  the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 80 percent  of the total projected benefit obligation and approximately 81 percent  of total plan assets at december 31 2012  

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the iprd acquired in a business combination all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size patent protection historical pricing of similar products and expected industry trends the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate this analysis is performed for each project independently 

for iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in the “latestage pipeline” section the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some iprd assets will become impaired in the future 

the estimated future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

income taxes 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed 

any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

as of december 31 2012  a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 464 million  and 338 million  respectively

financial expectations for 2013   

our 2013 financial guidance includes an estimated onetime benefit of 007 per share associated with the research and development tax credit for 2012 that will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013 resulting from the delay in the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 for the full year of 2013 we expect eps to be in the range of 410 to 425 we anticipate that total revenue will be between 226 billion and 234 billion despite the initial impact of the us cymbalta patent expiration in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the loss of the anticipated 15 percent revenuesharing obligation on worldwide exenatide sales we expect overall revenue growth driven by a portfolio of products including humalog humulin cialis strattera forteo alimta cymbalta outside the us effient tradjenta and axiron as well as animal health products in addition significant revenue growth is expected in japan and the emerging markets particularly china 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 78 percent marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 71 billion to 74 billion research and development expense is expected to be in the range of 52 billion to 55 billion other—net income expense is expected to be in a range between 340 million and 490 million of income operating cash flows are expected to be more than sufficient to pay our dividend complete our previously announced 15 billion share repurchase program allow for capital expenditures of approximately 900 million and fund potential business development activity

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2011 2010 and 2009 three wholesale distributors in the us—amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 11 percent and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated total revenue in any of those years 

we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the us and we maintain web sites with information about our major products we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with some of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on lilly products 

  

pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total revenue distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales organizations but in some countries we market our products through independent distributors 

pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the us elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors 

competition 

our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete globally with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health businesses 

important competitive factors include safety effectiveness and ease of use of our products price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products and processes most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions decreased sales volume or both increasingly to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers managed care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers we must demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also more value as compared with other forms of care 

manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals invest far less than we do in research and development and therefore can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when our branded pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the us intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective medicines that provide improved outcomes to individual patients and deliver value to payers together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the us and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes 

  

the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major markets such as the us various european countries and japan these patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent applications covering the compounds are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the “research and development” section of item 1 “business” in general national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the pct application which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term 

 

  

 loss of patent protection often results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which can result in severe and rapid decline in sales of the product however in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other followon versions of a new medicine beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws the primary forms of data protection are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 outside the major markets the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms and substantive limitations it is difficult to assess when and how much we will benefit commercially from this protection 

there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or 

  

processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties sometimes may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses—particularly those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or data package protection for our larger or recently launched patentprotected marketed products is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 us patent protection or data package protection for our new molecular entities that have been submitted for regulatory review is as follows additional information about these molecules is provided in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis under “late stage pipeline” the dates below do not include any potential patent extensions or adjustments as described above 

 

  

 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our major products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our larger products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others 

 

  

 patent challenges 

in the us the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy 

  

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filers of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

generic manufacturers use paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on alimta for more information on this litigation see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” 

outside the united states the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the us and we expect this trend to continue 

government regulation 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

outside the us our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency ema in the european union and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the department of justice and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities over this period several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information regarding a corporate integrity agreement entered into by lilly in connection with the resolution of a us federal marketing practices investigation and certain related state investigations involving zyprexa 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa recently the us securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice doj 

  

have increased their fcpa enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information about a currently pending secdoj investigation involving our operations in several countries 

in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent years several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area increased their enforcement activities and increased the level of crossborder coordination and information sharing 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from us federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of our products under state medicaid programs and to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities we also give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare additional cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

the enactment of the “patient protection and affordable care act” and “the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010” in march 2010 has brought significant changes to us health care increases in the minimum statutory rebate for branded prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries from 151 percent to 231 percent were generally effective in 2010 this rebate has been expanded to managedmedicaid a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies additionally a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in 340b facilities has been expanded beginning in 2011 drug manufacturers are required to provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage the doughnut hole is being phased out by the federal government between 2011 and 2020 additionally beginning in 2011 an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—legal regulatory and other matters” for more discussion of us health care reform at the state level budget pressures are causing various states to impose costcontrol measures such as higher rebates and more restrictive formularies 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection recently several governments have implemented acrosstheboard price cuts of branded pharmaceuticals as part of austerity measures in the face of the global financial crisis and severe national budget deficits 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory developments could negatively affect our pricing and rebates 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2011 we employed approximately 7500 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 502 billion in 2011 488 billion in 2010 and 433 billion in 2009 

our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on five therapeutic categories cancer endocrine diseases including diabetes obesity and musculoskeletal disorders central nervous system and related diseases autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are also investing in molecules with multipathway pharmacological efficacy to expand the potential of our therapeutic portfolio we have a strong biotechnology research program with nearly half of our clinical stage pipeline and more than half of our latestage pipeline currently consisting of biotechnology molecules in addition to discovering and developing new molecular entities we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients across all our therapeutic areas we are increasingly focusing our efforts on tailored therapeutics seeking to identify and use advanced diagnostic tools and other information to identify specific subgroups of patients for whom our medicines—or those of other companies—will be the best treatment option 

  

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our pharmaceutical products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies to collect and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics the following describes the new drug research and development process in more detail 

phases of new drug development 

discovery research phase 

the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological “targets” that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become “lead” molecules and go on to the next phase of development the probability of any one such lead molecule completing the rest of the drug development process and becoming a product is extremely low 

early development phase 

the early development phase involves refining lead molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans the first human tests often referred to as phase i are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose has been established the drug is administered to small populations of sick patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase typically less than 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase normally takes several years to complete 

product phase 

product phase phase iii molecules have already demonstrated safety and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are now rigorously tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from two to four years 

submission phase 

once a molecule submitted the time to final marketing approval can vary from six months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development we currently have approximately 65 drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval are potential therapies for diabetes various cancers alzheimer’s disease rheumatoid arthritis lupus psoriasis schizophrenia depression and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency as well as an imaging agent for detecting betaamyloid plaques which are associated with alzheimer’s disease in the brain we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including molecules targeting various cancers diabetes obesity alzheimer’s disease depression bipolar disorder migraine atherosclerosis anemia rheumatoid arthritis musculoskeletal disorders and renal diseases we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products including alimta cialis effient erbitux forteo and humalog 

  

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally have sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at four owned sites in the us as well as owned sites in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world in january 2010 we sold our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site in west lafayette indiana to an affiliate of evonik industries ag and entered into a nineyear supply and services agreement whereby evonik will manufacture final and intermediatestep active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain lilly human and animal health products 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicines we have implemented quality systems relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

executive officers of the company 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers except as otherwise noted all executive officers have been employed by the company in executive positions during the last five years 

the term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors to be held on april 16 2012 or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified no director or executive officer has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive officer of the company as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement there is no understanding between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected 

 

   

 employees 

at the end of 2011 we employed approximately 38080 people including approximately 20800 employees outside the united states a substantial number of our employees have long records of continuous service 

financial information relating to business segments and classes of products 

you can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products in item 8 of this form 10k “segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference 

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated revenue changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations in addition margins vary for our different products due to various factors including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the products the value of the products to the marketplace and government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement our major product revenues are generally not seasonal 

financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations 

you can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations in item 8 “segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference to date our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by local restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad including the availability of us dollar exchange we cannot predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign operations including possible nationalization might have on our future operations or what other restrictions may be imposed in the future in addition changing currency values can either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position liquidity and results of operations we mitigate foreign exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign currency contracts

 item 1a risk factors cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

  

we make certain forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and company spokespersons may make such statements in the future where possible we try to identify forwardlooking statements by using such words as “expect” “plan” “will” “estimate” “forecast” “project” “believe” and “anticipate” forwardlooking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts they are likely to address our growth strategy sales of current and anticipated products financial results our research and development programs the status of product approvals legislative and regulatory developments and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations all forwardlooking statements are based on our expectations at the time we make them they are subject to risks and uncertainties including those summarized below 

 

  

  

 intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major products will be routinely challenged and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” for more details we face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” for more details 

 

  

   

loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in a rapid and severe decline in sales see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—financial condition” and item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights” for more details

other product liability litigation 

we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability lawsuits in the us involving primarily zyprexa byetta diethylstilbestrol des and darvon 

in approximately 15 us lawsuits against us involving approximately 90 claimants plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed des during pregnancy in the 1950s and 1960s approximately 65 of these claimants allege that they were indirectly exposed in utero to the medicine and later developed breast cancer as a consequence in december 2009 a lawsuit was filed in us district court in washington dc against lilly and other manufacturers  michele fecho et al v eli lilly and company et al  seeking to assert product liability claims on behalf of a putative class of men and women allegedly exposed to the medicine who claim to have later developed breast cancer in january 2012 the judge in this case ordered the parties to proceed to mediation we believe these claims are without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously 

along with several other manufacturers we have been named as a defendant in approximately 165 cases in the us involving approximately 755 claimants related to the analgesic darvon and related formulations of propoxyphene these cases generally allege various cardiac injuries in november 2011 a lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the eastern district of louisiana  ballard et al v eli lilly and company et al against lilly and other manufacturers as a putative class action seeking to assert product liability claims on behalf of us residents who ingested propoxyphene and allegedly sustained personal injuries we transferred the us regulatory approvals and all marketing rights to our propoxyphene products in 2002 to aai pharma which subsequently transferred all such approvals and marketing rights to xanodyne pharmaceuticals inc we believe these claims are without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously 

we have been named along with takeda chemical industries ltd and takeda affiliates as a defendant in product liability cases in the us related to the diabetes medication actos which we copromoted with takeda in the us from 1999 until september 2006 under our agreement with takeda we will be indemnified by takeda for our losses and expenses in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

other marketing practices investigations 

in august 2003 we received notice that the staff of the sec is conducting an investigation into the compliance by polish subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies including lilly with the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the staff has issued subpoenas to us requesting production of documents related to the investigation in connection with that matter staffs of the sec and the department of justice doj have asked us to voluntarily provide additional information related to certain activities of lilly affiliates in a number of other countries the sec staff has also issued subpoenas related to activities in these countries we are cooperating with the sec and the doj in this investigation and are in advanced discussions with the sec to resolve their investigation

executive overview 

this section provides an overview of our financial results recent product and latestage pipeline developments and legal regulatory and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 

financial results 

we achieved revenue growth of 5 percent in 2011 which was primarily driven by the collective growth of cymbalta insulin products animal health products alimta effient and cialis offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity this revenue growth as well as a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by lower gross margin percentage increased marketing selling and administrative costs higher other expense and the increased impact in 2011 of the items noted below as a result net income decreased 14 percent to 435 billion and earnings per share decreased 15 percent to 390 per share in 2011 as compared to 507 billion or 458 per share in 2010

 latestage pipeline 

our longterm success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies we currently have approximately 65 potential new drugs in human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical research 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development rd and the introduction of new products a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than 

  

1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others delays and uncertainties in the us food and drug administration fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity consequently it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products 

we manage rd spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total rd spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the rd process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing completion dates and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our rd projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful rd project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated rd expense while we do accumulate certain rd costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total rd costs by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category

arxxant —in december we completed and evaluated the final clinical trial for arxxant the eyes study which did not meet the primary study endpoint we have opted not to resubmit arxxant to the fda for diabetic retinopathy 

bydureon —in june the european commission granted marketing authorization for bydureon the first onceweekly treatment for type 2 diabetes in combination with certain oral therapies european launches began in the third quarter of 2011 starting with the united kingdom and germany in january 2012 the fda approved bydureon as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes we and amylin terminated the collaboration in november 2011 refer to note 4 of the financial statements for additional information 

florbetapir —in march we received a complete response letter from the fda for the new drug application nda for amyvid florbetapir that was primarily focused on the need to establish a reader training program for market implementation that helps to ensure reader accuracy and consistency of interpretations of existing amyvid scans we submitted our response to the fda’s complete response letter 

ixekizumab —in november we began the first phase iii clinical trial for ixekizumab 

  

linagliptin and empagliflozin —in january 2011 we announced a global agreement with boehringer ingelheim boehringer to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes compounds currently in mid and latestage development including boehringer’s two investigational oral diabetes agents linagliptin and empagliflozin in 2011 linagliptin was approved and launched in the us trade name tradjenta japan trade name trazenta™ europe trade name trajenta ®  and other countries in january 2012 the fda approved jentadueto™ a combination of linagliptin and metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes 

liprotamase —in april we received a complete response letter from the fda for the nda for liprotamase that communicated the need for us to conduct an additional clinical trial prior to a resubmission we are currently finalizing the study design and anticipate starting a clinical study in 2012 

necitumumab —in february 2011 we and bristolmyers squibb company stopped enrollment in one of the two global phase iii studies the decision to stop enrollment in the phase iii nonsquamous nsclc inspire trial combination treatment with alimta followed an independent data monitoring committee recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism blood clots in the experimental arm of the study the second phase iii study in squamous nsclc looking at the combination use of necitumumab with gemzar is continuing 

new insulin glargine product —in september we began the first phase iii clinical trial for our new insulin glargine product 

novel basal insulin analog —in november we began the first phase iii clinical trial for our novel basal insulin analog 

pomaglumetad methionil —in february 2011 we began the first phase iii clinical trial for pomaglumetad methionil 

solanezumab —in january 2012 an independent data monitoring committee dmc recommended that we continue the two ongoing phase iii randomized pivotal trials for solanezumab without modifications based on preplanned interim safety and futility analyses the dmc also recommended that we make a protocol modification to expeditionxt the openlabel extension study of the two phase iii trials making the protocol for the openlabel extension more consistent with the current protocol for the pivotal studies 

acquisition 

in february 2012 we acquired chemgen corp a privatelyheld bioscience company specializing in the development and commercialization of innovative feed enzyme products that improve the efficiency of poultry egg and meat production the transaction is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

legal regulatory and other matters 

in october 2011 we announced the withdrawal of our xigris drotrecogin alfa activated product in all markets following results of the prowessshock study which did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in 28day allcause mortality in patients with septic shock we incurred a charge of 850 million pretax or approximately 05 per share for product returns and contractual commitments related to xigris revenue related to xigris has not been material to our consolidated financial statements 

the enactment of the “patient protection and affordable care act” ppaca and “the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010” in march 2010 brought significant changes to us health care these changes began to affect our financial results in the first quarter of 2010 and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future the us supreme court has agreed to decide the constitutionality of the ppaca oral arguments will take place in march 2012 and a decision is expected in the summer of 2012 

changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from 151 percent to 231 percent became effective in the first quarter of 2010 this rebate has been expanded to managed medicaid a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies additionally a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities has been expanded 

beginning in 2011 drug manufacturers provided a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage the doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between 2011 and 2020 additionally beginning in 2011 a nontaxdeductible annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs this fee is allocated to companies based on their priorcalendaryear market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs in 2011 we recorded 1780 million related to this fee which is included in marketing selling and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

also there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers such as us who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the medicare part d drug benefit beginning in 2013 the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers while this tax will not take effect for two more years accounting rules dictated that we adjust our deferred tax asset through a onetime noncash charge of 851 million upon enactment of the tax law change which we recorded in the first quarter of 2010 

the continuing prominence of us budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes fees rebates or other measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies’ revenue or increase 

  

expenses may be enacted certain other federal and state health care proposals continue to be debated and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices we also expect pricing pressures at state levels could become more severe these federal and state proposals or state price pressures could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies there also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress that could change the manner in which and the rate at which income of us companies would be taxed while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future reform of us taxation including taxation of international income will continue to be a topic of discussion for congress and the obama administration a significant change to the us tax system including changes to the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in october 2010 puerto rico enacted income and excise tax legislation affecting our operations this tax is included in costs of sales in our consolidated statement of operations we believe this tax should be creditable against our us income taxes 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and several european countries have recently required either price decreases or rebate increases in response to economic pressures we also anticipate an adverse effect from biennial pricing actions in japan there are proposals for costcontainment measures pending in a number of additional countries including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries 

operating results—2011 

revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2011 increased 5 percent to 2429 billion driven by the collective growth of cymbalta insulin products animal health products alimta effient and cialis offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity worldwide sales volume increased 6 percent and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue growth partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to lower prices the increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of us patent exclusivity for zyprexa and gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine revenue in the us increased 1 percent to 1298 billion due to higher volume partially offset by lower prices revenue outside the us increased 11 percent to 1131 billion due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices in 2011 total revenue was reduced by 4088 million due to the impact of us health care reform 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2011 compared with 2010 

 

  

    

 

zyprexa is a treatment for schizophrenia acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder and bipolar maintenance zyprexa sales in the us decreased 13 percent in 2011 due to the loss of patent exclusivity in 

  

the us on october 23 2011 despite a decline in demand for branded zyprexa us volume increased in 2011 primarily as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine in connection with our sixmonth agreement with prasco laboratories this volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to branded zyprexa and authorized olanzapine sales outside the us decreased 3 percent driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity throughout most major markets outside of japan during 2011 partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in japan in the five major european countries which in the aggregate had approximately 900 million in sales in 2011 we lost exclusivity in spain in april 2011 and in france germany italy and the united kingdom in september 2011 globally upon loss of exclusivity we are experiencing generic competition which is causing rapid and severe declines on our zyprexa sales in japan our secondlargest market with approximately 540 million in sales in 2011 our patent expires in december 2015 we anticipate worldwide sales of zyprexa to decline by at least 3 billion in 2012 

sales of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder and in the us for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia increased 14 percent in the us driven primarily by increased demand and higher prices sales outside the us increased 44 percent driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of alimta a treatment for various cancers increased 4 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices and increased demand sales outside the us increased 17 percent due to increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates we expect 2012 sales outside the us to be negatively affected by significant government price reductions in japan which is our second largest market for alimta and the introduction of generic competition in certain markets 

sales of humalog our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes increased 14 percent in the us due to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices sales outside the us increased 16 percent driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction also approved in october 2011 for benign prostatic hyperplasia in the us increased 7 percent in the us primarily due to higher prices sales outside the us increased 12 percent driven by increased demand the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices 

sales of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased 25 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices for humulin and increased demand attributable to humulin relion sales outside the us increased 7 percent due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices 

sales of evista a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer increased 4 percent in the us due to higher prices partially offset by lower demand sales outside the us increased 5 percent driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent increased demand partially offset by lower prices 

sales of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men decreased 9 percent in the us driven by lower demand partially offset by higher prices sales outside the us increased 50 percent primarily due to the increased demand in japan 

sales of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder in children adolescents and in the us in adults increased 1 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices partially offset by lower demand sales outside the us increased 22 percent driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices 

sales of gemzar a product approved to treat various cancers decreased 90 percent in the us due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition which began in november 2010 following the expiration of the compound patent sales outside the us decreased 10 percent due to generic competition in most major markets we expect sales to continue to decline in 2012 

we report as revenue for erbitux a product approved to treat various cancers the net royalties received from our collaboration partners and our product sales our revenues increased 6 percent to 4092 million in 2011 

prior to the termination of our exenatide collaboration with amylin in november 2011 we recognized in revenue our 50 percent share of byettas gross margin in the us in december 2011 we recognized a pro rata portion of revenue resulting from the termination arrangement we will continue to recognize 100 percent of byetta and bydureon sales outside the us until those markets transition to amylin on a marketbymarket basis over a period beginning no earlier than the second half of 2012 and that will not extend beyond december 31 2013 we also recognize our sales of byetta pen delivery devices to amylin which will continue until no later than the end of 2013 in 2011 we recognized total exenatide revenue of 4227 million a decrease of 2 percent 

animal health product sales in the us increased 16 percent due primarily to increased demand sales outside the us increased 27 percent during 2011 driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain janssen and pfizer animal health assets in europe and to a lesser extent increased demand for other products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

  

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 20 percentage points in 2011 to 791 percent this decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold which significantly increased cost of sales in 2011 but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in 2010 patent expirations for zyprexa and gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent 

marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2011 to 788 billion the increase was driven by the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates in addition higher administrative expenses in the us included 1780 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with us health care reform investment in research and development increased 3 percent to 502 billion due primarily to increased latestage clinical trial costs including costs related to the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 

we incurred an iprd charge of 3880 million in 2011 associated with our diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim compared with 500 million in 2010 associated with the inlicensing agreement with acrux we recognized asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 4014 million in 2011 including charges of 3164 million primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce and a special charge of 850 million related to the withdrawal of xigris in 2010 we recognized charges totaling 1920 million for asset impairments restructuring and other special charges see notes 3 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net expense increased 1740 million to a net expense of 1790 million in 2011 due primarily to the partial impairment of the acquired iprd assets related to liprotamase and amyvid in 2011 and damages recovered in 2010 from generic pharmaceutical companies related to zyprexa patent litigation in germany 

our effective tax rate was 187 percent in 2011 compared with 223 percent in 2010 the decrease was due to the tax benefit on the iprd charge associated with the boehringer ingelheim diabetes collaboration as well as a benefit of 853 million primarily from the resolution in 2011 of the irs audits of tax years 20052007 along with certain matters related to 20082009 additionally the tax rate for 2010 was increased by a onetime charge of 851 million associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of us health care reform 

operating results—2010 

financial results 

we achieved revenue growth of 6 percent to 2308 billion in 2010 which was primarily driven by the collective growth of alimta cymbalta animal health products insulin products cialis and zyprexa offset by a decline in gemzar revenue cost of sales and marketing selling and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than revenue and our effective tax rate increased net income increased 17 percent to 507 billion and earnings per share increased 16 percent to 458 per share in 2010 as compared to 433 billion or 394 per share in 2009 net income comparisons between 2010 and 2009 are affected by the impact of several highlighted items the highlighted items for 2010 are summarized in the executive overview the 2009 highlighted items are summarized as follows

our worldwide revenue for 2010 increased 6 percent to 2308 billion driven by the collective growth of alimta cymbalta animal health products insulin products cialis and zyprexa offset by a decline in gemzar revenue worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent while selling prices contributed 2 percent of revenue growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates was negligible revenue in the us increased 5 percent to 1287 billion due to higher prices revenue outside the us increased 7 percent to 1021 billion due to increased demand partially offset by lower prices in 2010 total revenue was reduced by 2290 million due to the impact of us health care reform 

  

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

  

    

 

zyprexa sales in the us increased 7 percent in 2010 driven by higher prices partially offset by lower demand sales outside the us decreased 2 percent driven by lower prices and decreased demand in europe and canada partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in japan 

sales of cymbalta increased 9 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 31 percent driven primarily by increased demand in japan europe and canada 

sales of alimta increased 17 percent in the us due primarily to increased demand sales outside the us increased 41 percent due to increased demand demand outside the us was favorably affected by continued strong growth in japan 

sales of humalog increased 1 percent in the us due to higher prices partially offset by the impact of wholesaler buying patterns sales outside the us increased 11 percent driven by increased demand primarily in japan and china 

sales of cialis increased 6 percent in the us due to higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent due primarily to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices 

sales of gemzar decreased 3 percent in the us due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition which began in november 2010 following the expiration of the compound patent sales outside the us decreased 31 percent due primarily to generic competition in most major markets 

sales of humulin increased 17 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices and increased demand sales outside the us remained essentially flat when compared to 2009 due to lower prices offset by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of evista remained essentially flat in the us due to decreased demand offset by increased prices sales outside the us decreased 2 percent driven by lower prices and lower demand partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of forteo decreased 4 percent in the us driven by lower demand partially offset by higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent due to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices

erbitux revenues were 3861 million in 2010 compared with 3908 million in 2009 

animal health product sales in the us and outside the us increased 15 percent due primarily to increased demand for our companion animal and feed additive products 

  

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 05 percentage points in 2010 to 811 percent this increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 

marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2010 to 705 billion the increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the us partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and companywide cost containment efforts investment in research and development increased 13 percent to 488 billion due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials 

we incurred an iprd charge of 500 million in 2010 associated with the inlicensing agreement with acrux compared with 900 million in 2009 resulting from the inlicensing agreement with incyte we recognized asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 1920 million in 2010 primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce in 2009 we recognized charges totaling 6927 million for asset impairments restructuring and other special charges see notes 3 5 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net expense improved 2245 million to a net expense of 50 million in 2010 due primarily to net gains on equity investments lower net interest expense damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following zyprexa patent litigation in germany and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at our enfield connecticut distribution center 

the effective tax rate was 223 percent for 2010 compared with 192 percent for 2009 the 2010 increase was driven by 851 million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to us health care reform the 2009 effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2011 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 690 billion compared with 673 billion at december 31 2010 the increase in cash was driven by cash from operations of 723 billion partially offset by net noncurrent investment activity as cash was invested with maturities greater than one year of 232 billion dividends paid of 218 billion business and product acquisitions of 133 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 6720 million 

capital expenditures of 6720 million during 2011 were 223 million less than in 2010 we expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately 800 million as we invest in the longterm growth of our diabetescare product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality productivity and capability of our manufacturing research and development facilities 

total debt at december 31 2011 was 699 billion an increase of 605 million from december 31 2010 which was due primarily to the 2524 million increase in the fair value of hedged debt offset by the full repayment in 2011 of 1250 million of shortterm floating rate debt and 637 million in employee stock ownership plan debentures in 2012 we plan to retire 151 billion of our debt as it matures our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s remain aa and a2 respectively our ratings outlook from both moody’s and standard  poor’s is stable 

dividends of 196 per share were paid in 2011 and 2010 2011 was the 127th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments in the fourth quarter of 2011 effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2012 the quarterly dividend was maintained at 49 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2012 of 196 per share 

as of the fourth quarter of 2011 the us economy continues to recover while concerns have grown regarding the health of the european economy worries in europe have spread beyond the “peripheral” nations to encompass the entirety of the euro area with many economists believing a recession in the euro area to be probable meanwhile us economic data in the fourth quarter generally exceeded expectations with housing and employment indicators signaling a strengthening recovery still given the fragility of the economic recovery and the heightened anxiety regarding europe the federal reserve has maintained its view that accommodative policy is likely to be warranted through 2014 both domestically and abroad high sovereign debt levels sluggish growth rating downgrades and ongoing fiscal deficits have spurred efforts at fiscal austerity notably in spain italy and greece we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers including foreign government backed agencies and suppliers the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation the federal government’s involvement in the us economy and various international government funding levels currently we believe economic conditions in europe will not have a material impact on our liquidity 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including debt service capital expenditures and dividends in 2012 we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowings because of the high credit quality of our short and longterm debt our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected we currently have 124 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion of which backs our commercial paper program various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and the “financial expectations for 2012” section may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

  

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings through 2014 we expect to lose us patent protection for cymbalta june 2013 and evista march 2014  cymbalta could receive an additional six months of exclusivity based on completion of pediatric studies 

zyprexa and gemzar have already lost exclusivity in the us and europe in the us gemzar lost exclusivity in november 2010 and zyprexa lost exclusivity in october 2011 in addition we face us patent litigation over alimta and it is possible we could lose our exclusivity prior to the expiration of the relevant patents refer to the hatchwaxman patent litigation discussion in note 15 and in the “legal and regulatory matters” section below the loss of exclusivity for alimta cymbalta or evista would likely result in generic competition generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the us patent for humalog expires in may 2013 humalog is currently protected in europe only by formulation patents we do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue to date no company has received approval to market a biosimilar version of humalog however it is difficult to predict the likelihood and impact of biosimilars entering the market our goal is to mitigate the effect of these exclusivity losses on our operations liquidity and financial position through growth in our patentprotected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period in emerging markets in japan and in our animal health business our expected growth in the emerging markets and japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of new products in these markets 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2011 and 2010 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro the british pound and the japanese yen our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2011 and 2010 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

  

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 

 

  

       

 

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2011 we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated productsupply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

  

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other government programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserves 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances us sales returns federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by 246 billion 166 billion and 120 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively a 5 percent change in the sales return medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2011 would lead to an approximate 123 million effect on our income before income taxes as of december 31 2011 our sales returns medicaid and medicare rebate liability was 123 billion 

our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet approximately 82 percent and 83 percent of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us returns rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 

 

  

  

 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance we have been and will continue to be largely selfinsured for future product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan 

  

assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans in evaluating these assumptions we consider many factors including an evaluation of the discount rates expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates of other companies our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately 81 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we use an actuarially determined companyspecific yield curve to determine the discount rate in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2011 annual expense would increase by 151 million a onepercentagepoint decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2011 service cost and interest cost by 123 million if the 2011 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 284 million if the 2011 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 192 million if our assumption regarding the 2011 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 353 million the us plans including puerto rico represent approximately 82 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 81 percent of total plan assets at december 31 2011 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the iprd acquired in a business combination all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size patent protection historical pricing of similar products and expected industry trends the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate this analysis is performed for each project independently 

for iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in the “latestage pipeline” section the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some iprd assets will become impaired at some time in the future 

the estimated future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

income taxes 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable 

  

income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 406 million and 306 million respectively 

financial expectations for 2012 

for the full year of 2012 we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 310 to 320 we anticipate that total revenue will be between 218 billion and 228 billion this includes an expected decline of more than 3 billion in zyprexa sales due to patent expirations in most markets outside of japan the reduction in revenue due to zyprexa patent expirations is expected to be partially offset by growth in key franchises including cymbalta cialis humalog humulin and forteo as well as continued growth of newer products such as effient axiron and tradjenta we also anticipate continued strong doubledigit revenue growth from our elanco animal health business both japan and emerging markets are expected to post continued strong underlying volume growth however overall revenue growth in these markets in 2012 will be adversely affected by anticipated pricing actions in japan and by the expected impact of patent expirations including zyprexa in some emerging market countries 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 77 percent marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to decline and be in the range of 74 billion to 78 billion research and development expense is expected to be flat to increasing and in the range of 50 billion to 53 billion other—net expense is expected to be in a range between net expense of 50 million and net income of 100 million operating cash flows are expected to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately 800 million as well as anticipated business development activity and our current dividend 

private securities litigation reform act of 1995— 

a caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we caution investors that any forwardlooking statements or projections made by us including those above are based on management’s belief at the time they are made however they are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially and will depend on among other things the continuing growth of our currently marketed products developments with competitive products the implementation of us health care reform the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches asset impairments restructurings and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired iprd charges foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions changes in effective tax rates wholesaler inventory changes other regulatory developments litigation patent disputes and government investigations the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing importation and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects which are discussed earlier in this section and in item 1a “risk factors” we undertake no duty to update these forwardlooking statements 

legal and regulatory matters 

we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations the most significant of these are described below it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters and we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for any of these matters however we believe that except as specifically noted below with respect to the alimta hatchwaxman act patent challenges the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 

patent litigation 

we are engaged in the following us patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 

 

 we believe the hatchwaxman challenges to alimta are without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated 

  

results of operations liquidity and financial position we expect a loss of exclusivity for alimta would result in a rapid and severe decline in future revenues in the relevant market 

 

 zyprexa litigation 

we are a defendant in approximately 40 zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us covering approximately 120 plaintiffs the lawsuits allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug approximately 25 of the lawsuits covering about 30 plaintiffs are part of a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york edny mdl no 1596 in october 2011 a jury trial in a california state court was decided in our favor we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all these lawsuits and claims 

we were served with lawsuits filed by 13 states alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug we settled the zyprexarelated claims of all of these states incurring pretax charges of 2300 million in 2009 and 150 million in 2008 

in 2005 and 2006 four lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities which made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa these actions were consolidated into a single lawsuit brought under certain state consumerprotection statutes the federal civil racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and common law theories seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa treble damages punitive damages and attorneys’ fees as with the product liability suits these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug in september 2008 judge weinstein certified a class consisting of thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities and individual consumers and denied our motion for summary judgment in september 2010 both decisions were reversed by the second circuit court of appeals which found that the case cannot proceed as a class action and entered a judgment in our favor on plaintiffs’ overpricing claim the us supreme court denied plaintiffs’ petition for certiorari all remaining claims at issue in these cases have now been resolved 

byetta litigation 

we have been named as a defendant in approximately 120 lawsuits involving approximately 480 plaintiffs primarily seeking to recover damages for pancreatitis experienced by patients prescribed byetta we are aware of approximately 530 additional claimants who have not yet filed suit approximately 100 of these lawsuits are filed in california and coordinated in a los angeles superior court 

other product liability litigation 

we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol these claims are covered by insurance subject to deductibles and coverage limits 

product liability insurance 

because of the nature of pharmaceutical products it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future in the past several years we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies in 2010 2009 and 2008 three wholesale distributors in the united states—amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 12 percent and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales in any of those years we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government but those sales are not material 

we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are assigned to therapeutic areas such as neuroscience diabetes and oncology we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups government agencies and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with these organizations which provide for discounts or rebates on one or more lilly products 

pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales organizations but in some countries we market our products through independent distributors 

  

pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

we market certain of our significant products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 

 

  

  

  

  

 animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors 

competition 

our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries 

important competitive factors include safety effectiveness and ease of use of our products price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products and processes most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions decreased volume of sales or both increasingly to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers managed care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers we must demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also more value as compared with other forms of care 

manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals invest far less than we do in research and development and therefore can price their products much lower than our branded products accordingly when our branded pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states intellectual property protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products 

we believe our longterm competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative costeffective medicines that provide improved outcomes to individual patients and deliver value to payers together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products and it is possible that our products will become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the united states and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products in addition competitors or other third parties sometimes may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

outside the united states the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms and substantive limitations it is difficult to assess when and how much if at all we will benefit commercially from this protection 

  

when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or databased exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

some of our current products including erbitux forteo reopro and xigris and many of the potential products in our research pipeline are biological products “biologics” based on the biologics price competition and innovation act enacted in the us in 2010 the fda now has the authority to approve similar versions “biosimilars” of innovative biologic products a competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic address the challenges of biologics manufacturing and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data which fda will determine on a casebycase basis under the data protection provisions of this law fda cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic regulators in the eu and other countries also have been given the authority to approve biosimilars the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiologic products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses—particularly those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

the most relevant us patent protection or databased exclusivity for our major patentprotected marketed products is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent licenses 

most of our important products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our larger products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others 

 

  

   

patent challenges 

in the united states the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws before hatch waxman no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on alimta cymbalta gemzar and strattera for more information on this litigation see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” 

outside the united states the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the united states and we expect this trend to continue for more information on significant patent challenges outside the united states see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” 

government regulation 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide quality systems in our manufacturing product development and process development operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

outside the united states our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency ema in the european union and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the department of justice and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities over this period several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements see item 3 “legal 

  

proceedings” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” for information about currently pending and certain prior marketing and promotional practices investigations involving lilly including information regarding a corporate integrity agreement entered into by lilly in connection with the resolution of a us federal marketing practices investigation and certain related state investigations involving zyprexa 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our payments to these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa recently the us securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice have increased their fcpa enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information about a currently pending investigation involving our operations in several countries 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in pending or future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of our products under state medicaid programs and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare or cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities additional cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

the enactment of the “patient protection and affordable care act” and “the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010” in march 2010 brings significant changes to us health care changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from 151 percent to 231 percent were generally effective in the first quarter of 2010 this rebate has been expanded to managedmedicaid a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies additionally a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities has been expanded beginning in 2011 drug manufacturers will provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage the doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between 2011 and 2020 additionally beginning in 2011 an annual fee will be imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—legal regulatory and other matters” for more discussion of us health care reform at the state level budget pressures are causing various states to impose costcontrol measures such as higher rebates and more restrictive formularies 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection recently several governments have implemented across the board price cuts of branded pharmaceuticals in response to national budget pressures 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will become more severe 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2010 we employed approximately 7400 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 488 billion in 2010 433 billion in 2009 and 384 billion in 2008 

  

our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on five therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes obesity and musculoskeletal disorders cancer autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in a strong biotechnology research program with more than onethird of our clinical stage pipeline currently consisting of biotechnology molecules in addition to discovering and developing new molecular entities we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients across all our therapeutic areas we are increasingly focusing our efforts on tailored therapeutics seeking to identify and use advanced diagnostic tools and other information to identify specific subgroups of patients for whom our medicines—or those of other companies—will be the best treatment option 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our pharmaceutical products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success even after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies the following describes the new drug research and development process in more detail 

phases of new drug development 

discovery research phase 

the earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many years scientists identify design and synthesize promising molecules screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological “targets” that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases targets can be part of the body such as a protein receptor or gene or foreign such as a virus or bacteria some targets have been proven to affect disease processes but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become “lead” molecules and go on to the next phase of development the probability of any one such lead molecule completing the rest of the drug development process and becoming a product is extremely low 

early development phase 

the early development phase involves refining lead molecules understanding how to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans the first human tests often referred to as phase i are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and find the potential dosing range after a safe dose has been established the drug is administered to small populations of sick patients phase ii to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease and to continue to assess safety in parallel scientists work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing processes longterm animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues of the molecules that enter the early development phase typically less than 10 percent move on to the product phase the early development phase normally takes several years to complete 

product phase 

product phase phase iii molecules have already demonstrated safety and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy as a result these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success the molecules are now rigorously tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval the new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and submitted to regulatory agencies around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from 2 to 4 years 

submission phase 

once submitted the time to final marketing approval can vary from six months to several years depending on variables such as the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agencyies to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas 

  

we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development at present we have more than 65 drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development among our new investigational molecules in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval are potential therapies for diabetes cancers alzheimer’s disease rheumatoid arthritis lupus depression and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency as well as an imaging agent for detecting betaamyloid plaques which are associated with alzheimer’s disease in the brain we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including molecules targeting cancers diabetes obesity alzheimer’s disease schizophrenia depression bipolar disorder migraine alcohol dependence musculoskeletal disorders atherosclerosis anemia benign prostatic hyperplasia erectile dysfunction and renal diseases we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products including alimta byetta cialis effient erbitux forteo and humalog 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition byetta is manufactured by thirdparty suppliers to amylin in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally have sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at four owned sites in the united states as well as owned sites in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world effective in january 2010 we sold one of our us sites tippecanoe laboratories in west lafayette indiana to an affiliate of evonik industries ag and entered into a nineyear supply and services agreement whereby evonik will manufacture final and intermediate step active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain lilly human and animal health products 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

executive officers of the company 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers except as otherwise noted all executive officers have been employed by the company in executive positions during the last five years 

the term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors to be held on april 18 2011 or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified no director or executive officer has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive officer of the company as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement there is no understanding between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected 

 

   

 employees 

at the end of 2010 we employed approximately 38350 people including approximately 20700 employees outside the united states a substantial number of our employees have long records of continuous service 

financial information relating to business segments and classes of products 

you can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products in item 8 of this form 10k “segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference 

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net sales changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations in addition margins vary for our different products due to various factors including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the products the value of the products to the marketplace and government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement our major product sales are generally not seasonal 

financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations 

you can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations in item 8 “segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference to date our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by local restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad including the availability of us dollar exchange we cannot predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign operations including possible nationalization might have on our future operations or what other restrictions may be imposed in the future in addition changing currency values can either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position liquidity and results of operations we mitigate foreign exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign currency contracts

 item 1a risk factors cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements tableend in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

we make certain forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and company spokespersons may make such statements in the future where possible we try to identify forwardlooking statements by using such words as “expect” “plan” “will” “estimate” “forecast” “project” “believe” and “anticipate” forwardlooking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts they are likely to address our growth strategy sales of current and anticipated products financial results our research and development programs the status of product approvals legislative and regulatory developments and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations all forwardlooking statements are based on our expectations at the time we make them they are subject to risks and uncertainties including those summarized below 

 

  

  

 intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major products will be routinely challenged and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property protection” for more details we are increasingly facing generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property protection” for more details 

  

  

  

  

 

loss of exclusivity whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation typically results in a rapid and severe decline in sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property protection” for more details

other patent litigation 

cialis in july 2005 vanderbilt university filed a lawsuit in the us district court in delaware against icos corporation seeking to add three of its scientists as coinventors on the cialis compound and methodofuse patents in january 2009 the district court judge ruled in our favor declining to add any of these scientists as an inventor on either patent the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the lower court ruling in april 2010 in january 2011 the us supreme court declined to review this decision and no further appeals are possible 

other product liability litigation 

we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability lawsuits in the united states involving primarily zyprexa thimerosal byetta and diethylstilbestrol des 

we have been named as a defendant in approximately 120 actions in the us involving approximately 140 claimants brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us beginning in the 1930s we purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to thimerosal in the 1920s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the majority of the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies in march 2010 three special masters of the court of claims issued rulings in the three separate test cases all concluding that thimerosalcontaining vaccines do not cause autism petitioners did not seek review of these decisions and the judgments were entered dismissing the cases in april 2010 all claimants have been notified that if they intend to pursue their claims they will be required to identify a separate theory consistent with the requirements of the act 

we have been named a defendant in approximately 100 byetta product liability lawsuits involving approximately 335 plaintiffs primarily seeking to recover damages for pancreatitis experienced by patients prescribed byetta we are aware of approximately 40 additional claimants who have not yet filed suit the majority of the cases are filed in california and coordinated in a los angeles superior court in june 2009 a lawsuit was filed in louisiana state court  ralph jackson v eli lilly and company et al  seeking to assert similar product liability claims on behalf of louisiana residents who were prescribed byetta however the plaintiff dropped the class action allegations we believe these claims are without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously 

in approximately 20 us lawsuits against us involving approximately 100 claimants plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed des during pregnancy in the 1950s 

  

and 1960s approximately 65 of these claimants allege that they were indirectly exposed in utero to the medicine and later developed breast cancer as a consequence in december 2009 a lawsuit was filed in us district court in washington dc against lilly and other manufacturers  michele fecho et al v eli lilly and company et al  seeking to assert product liability claims on behalf of a putative class of men and women allegedly exposed to the medicine who claim to have later developed breast cancer we believe these claims are without merit and are prepared to defend against them vigorously

we have also been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the us district court for the northern district of new york  schaeferlarose et al v eli lilly and company  filed november 14 2006 claiming that our pharmaceutical sales representatives should have been categorized as “nonexempt” rather than “exempt” employees and claiming that the company owes them back wages for overtime worked as well as penalties interest and attorneys’ fees other pharmaceutical industry participants face similar lawsuits the case was transferred to the us district court for the southern district of indiana and in february 2008 the indianapolis court conditionally certified a nationwide optin collective action under the fair labor standards act of all current and former employees who served as a lilly pharmaceutical sales representative at any time from november 2003 to the present as of the close of the optin period fewer than 400 of the over 7500 potential plaintiffs elected to participate in the lawsuit in september 2009 the district court granted our motion for summary judgment with regard to ms schaeferlarose’s claims and ordered the plaintiffs to demonstrate why the entire collective action should not be decertified within 30 days plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment decision and also opposed decertification and in october 2010 the court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration but decided not to decertify the collective action at this time plaintiffs have filed an appeal of the summary judgment ruling we believe this lawsuit is without merit and are prepared to defend against it vigorously

this section provides an overview of our financial results recent product and latestage pipeline developments and legal regulatory and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 

financial results 

we achieved revenue growth of 6 percent in 2010 which was primarily driven by the collective growth of alimta cymbalta animal health products insulin products cialis and zyprexa offset by the decline in gemzar revenue cost of sales and marketing selling and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than revenue and our effective tax rate increased as a result of these factors as well as higher other income in 2010 and the items noted below net income increased 17 percent to 507 billion and earnings per share increased 16 percent to 458 per share in 2010 as compared to 433 billion or 394 per share in 2009

 latestage pipeline 

our longterm success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies we currently have more than 65 potential new drugs in human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development 

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than 1 billion failure can occur at any point in the process including late in the process after substantial investment as a result most research programs will not generate financial returns new product candidates that 

  

appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others delays and uncertainties in the us food and drug administration fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity consequently it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products 

we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules and a delay in or termination of one project will not by itself necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process we cannot reliably estimate the nature timing completion dates and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none are individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes we must make significant cost estimations and allocations some of which rely on data that is neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms as a consequence we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by therapeutic category 

new molecular entities currently in phase iii clinical trial testing include the following 

baff antibody —an antibaff antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus 

bi10773 —a sglt2 inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 

enzastaurin —a small molecule for the treatment of diffuse large bcell lymphoma 

glp1 fc —a glucagonlike peptide 1 analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 

necitumumab —a fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated as a treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer 

neri —a potent and highly selective norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor being investigated as a treatment for major depression 

ramucirumab —a monoclonal antibody being investigated as a treatment for metastatic breast and gastric cancers 

solanezumab —an amyloid beta aß antibody for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease 

new molecular entities that have been submitted for regulatory review include the following 

arxxant —a potential treatment for diabetic retinopathy 

florbetapir —a molecular imaging tool under investigation for the detection of betaamyloid plaque in the brain the absence of betaamyloid plaque in the brain makes a diagnosis of alzheimer’s disease unlikely 

linagliptin —a dpp4 inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 

liprotamase —a nonporcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy

 legal regulatory and other matters 

the us compound patent for gemzar expired november 15 2010 our methodofuse patent expiring in 2013 was held invalid by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit we are seeking review by the us supreme court but generic gemcitabine was introduced to the us market in midnovember 2010 and gemzar sales are experiencing a rapid and severe decline 

the us district court for the district of new jersey ruled that our methodofuse patent for strattera which expires in 2017 is invalid our appeal to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit was heard in december 2010 and we are awaiting a ruling the court of appeals has granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic atomoxetine until a ruling is rendered several generic companies have tentative approval to market generic atomoxetine and should the appeal be unsuccessful we would anticipate a rapid and severe decline in strattera sales due to generic competition 

the enactment of the “patient protection and affordable care act” and “the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010” in march 2010 brings significant changes to us health care these changes began to 

  

affect our financial results in the first quarter of 2010 and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from 151 percent to 231 percent were generally effective in the first quarter of 2010 this rebate has been expanded to managed medicaid a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies additionally a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve lowincome and uninsured patients known as 340b facilities has been expanded also there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers such as us who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the medicare part d drug benefit beginning in 2013 the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers while this tax will not take effect for three more years accounting rules dictate that we adjust our deferred tax asset through a onetime noncash charge upon enactment of the tax law change which we recorded in the first quarter of 2010 in addition the federal government created an expedited regulatory approval pathway in the us for biosimilars or followon biologics copies of biological compounds biologics will have at least 12 years of datapackage protection following launch congress is expected to take up patent law reform in 2011 some proposals would strengthen the pharmaceutical business model while others under consideration might pose some risks 

beginning in 2011 drug manufacturers will provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the “doughnut hole” the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage the doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between 2011 and 2020 additionally beginning in 2011 a nontax deductible annual fee will be imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs this fee is allocated to companies based on their prior calendar year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs a guidance project is currently under way within the irs and us treasury concerning the implementation of this fee these costs will be included in marketing selling and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies some provisions changing taxation of international income were enacted in august 2010 these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future reform of us taxation including taxation of international income continues to be a topic of discussion for congress and the obama administration a significant change to the us tax system including changes to the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations on october 25 2010 puerto rico enacted income and excise tax legislation affecting our operations this tax will be included in costs of sales in our consolidated statement of operations we believe this tax should be creditable against our us income taxes 

certain other federal and state health care proposals may continue to be debated and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices these proposals include legalizing the importation of prescription drugs and other costcontrol strategies in addition the constitutionality of us health care reform is being challenged we expect pricing pressures at state levels to become more severe which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and several european countries have recently required either price decreases or rebate increases in response to economic pressures there are proposals for costcontainment measures pending in a number of additional countries including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact given the effect of the downturn in the global economy on local governments 

  

operating results—2010 

revenue 

our worldwide revenue for 2010 increased 6 percent to 2308 billion driven by the collective growth of alimta cymbalta animal health products insulin products cialis and zyprexa offset by the decline in gemzar revenue worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent while selling prices contributed 2 percent of revenue growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates was negligible revenue in the us increased 5 percent to 1287 billion due to higher prices revenue outside the us increased 7 percent to 1021 billion due to increased demand partially offset by lower prices in 2010 total revenue was reduced by 2290 million due to the impact of us health care reform 

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

  

    

 

zyprexa our topselling product is a treatment for schizophrenia acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder and bipolar maintenance zyprexa sales in the us increased 7 percent in 2010 driven by higher prices partially offset by lower demand sales outside the us decreased 2 percent driven by lower prices and decreased demand in europe and canada partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in japan we will lose effective exclusivity for zyprexa in the us in october 2011 we will also lose effective exclusivity in most of europe in 2011 in the five major european countries which in the aggregate had approximately 140 billion in sales for 2010 we will lose effective exclusivity in april 2011 spain and september 2011 france germany italy and the united kingdom several manufacturers have received tentative approvals to market generic olanzapine and we expect generic olanzapine to be introduced in these markets immediately following the expiration of the patents while it is difficult to predict the precise impact on zyprexa sales we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our zyprexa sales which will have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows in japan our secondlargest market for zyprexa with more than 400 million of sales in 2010 our patent expires in december 2015 

sales of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain generalized anxiety disorder and in the united states for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia increased 9 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices sales outside the us increased 31 percent driven primarily by increased demand in japan europe and canada 

sales of alimta a treatment for various cancers increased 17 percent in the us due primarily to increased demand sales outside the us increased 41 percent due to increased demand demand outside the us was favorably affected by continued strong growth in japan

sales of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction increased 6 percent in the us due to higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent due primarily to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices 

  

sales of gemzar a product approved to treat various cancers decreased 3 percent in the us due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition which began in november 2010 following the expiration of the compound patent sales outside the us decreased 31 percent due primarily to generic competition in most major markets we expect sales to decline in 2011 with severe declines in the us 

sales of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes increased 17 percent in the us driven primarily by higher prices and increased demand sales outside the us remained essentially flat when compared to 2009 due to lower prices offset by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates

gross margin costs and expenses 

gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 05 percentage points in 2010 to 811 percent this increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 

marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2010 to 705 billion the increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the us partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and companywide cost containment efforts investment in research and development increased 13 percent to 488 billion due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials 

we incurred an iprd charge of 500 million in 2010 associated with the inlicensing agreement with acrux compared with 900 million in 2009 resulting from the inlicensing agreement with incyte we recognized asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 1920 million in 2010 primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce in 2009 we recognized charges totaling 6927 million for asset impairments restructuring and other special charges see notes 3 5 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net expense improved 2245 million to a net expense of 50 million in 2010 due primarily to net gains on equity investments lower net interest expense damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following zyprexa patent litigation in germany and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at the company’s enfield connecticut distribution center 

the effective tax rate was 223 percent for the fullyear 2010 in 2009 the effective tax rate was 192 percent the 2010 effective tax rate increased due to 851 million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to us health care reform the 2009 effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site 

  

operating results—2009 

financial results 

we achieved revenue growth of 7 percent in 2009 which was primarily driven by the collective growth of alimta cymbalta humalog and zyprexa and the inclusion of erbitux revenue as a result of the imclone systems inc imclone acquisition in november 2008 the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the us dollar on international inventories sold during the year decreased our cost of sales in 2009 and increased our cost of sales in 2008 which contributed to an improvement in gross margin marketing selling and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than sales we incurred income tax expense of 103 billion in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 192 percent earnings increased to 433 billion and earnings per share increased to 394 per share in 2009 as compared to a net loss of 207 billion and a loss per share of 189 in 2008 net income comparisons between 2009 and 2008 are affected by the impact of several highlighted items the highlighted items for 2009 are summarized in the executive overview the 2008 highlighted items are summarized as follows

the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2009 compared with 2008 

 

  

    

 

zyprexa sales in the us increased 6 percent in 2009 due to higher prices partially offset by reduced demand sales outside the us increased 4 percent driven by increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates demand outside the us was favorably impacted by the withdrawal of generic competition in germany in early 2009 

sales of cymbalta in 2009 increased 13 percent in the us driven by higher prices and increased demand sales outside the us increased 18 percent driven by increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices 

sales of humalog in 2009 increased 20 percent in the us driven by higher prices increased demand and wholesaler buying patterns sales outside the us increased 3 percent driven by increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of alimta increased 45 percent in the us primarily driven by increased demand sales outside the us increased 50 percent driven by increased demand partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates demand outside the us benefited from the addition of the nonsmall cell lung cancer indication in japan 

our sales of cialis increased 16 percent in the us driven by higher prices increased demand and wholesaler buying patterns sales outside the us increased 3 percent driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of gemzar increased 2 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices sales outside the us decreased 37 percent driven by reduced demand and lower prices as a result of the entry of generic competition in most major markets and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of evista decreased 3 percent in the us driven by reduced demand partially offset by higher prices sales outside the us decreased 7 percent driven by the outlicensing of evista in most european markets and to a lesser extent lower prices 

sales of humulin increased 6 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices partially offset by reduced demand sales outside the us decreased 9 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent lower prices partially offset by increased demand 

sales of forteo increased 6 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by reduced demand sales outside the us increased 3 percent driven by increased demand and prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

sales of strattera increased 2 percent in the us driven by higher prices partially offset by reduced demand sales outside the us increased 15 percent driven by increased demand and higher prices partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

  

worldwide sales of byetta increased 6 percent to 7965 million during 2009 our revenues increased 13 percent to 4485 million in 2009 

erbitux revenues were 3908 million in 2009 compared with 294 million in 2008 we acquired erbitux as part of our acquisition of imclone in november 2008 

animal health product sales in the us increased 25 percent primarily driven by the inclusion of posilac sales following the acquisition completed october 2008 sales outside the us decreased 4 percent driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

gross margin costs and expenses 

the 2009 gross margin increased to 806 percent of total revenue compared with 785 percent for 2008 this increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the us dollar on international inventories sold during the year which decreased cost of sales in 2009 but increased cost of sales in 2008 

marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 4 percent in 2009 to 689 billion the increase was driven by the increased marketing and selling expenses outside the us higher incentive compensation and the impact of the imclone acquisition partially offset by the movement of foreign exchange rates investment in research and development increased 13 percent to 433 billion due primarily to the imclone acquisition and increased latestage clinical trial costs 

we incurred an iprd charge of 900 million in 2009 associated with the inlicensing agreement with incyte compared with 484 billion in 2008 the 2008 iprd charge included 469 billion resulting from the acquisition of imclone we recognized asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 6927 million in 2009 primarily related to asset impairment charges related to the sale of our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site and special charges related to zyprexa litigation with multiple state attorneys general compared with 197 billion in 2008 the 2008 charges were primarily associated with the resolution of zyprexa investigations with the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania and multiple states see notes 3 5 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other—net expense was a net expense in both years increasing by 2034 million to 2295 million in 2009 primarily due to lower interest income and higher interest expense resulting from the imclone acquisition 

we incurred income tax expense of 103 billion in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 192 percent the effective tax rate for 2009 was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the tippecanoe site we incurred tax expense of 7643 million in 2008 despite having a loss before income taxes of 131 billion our net loss was driven by the 469 billion iprd charge for imclone and the 148 billion zyprexa investigation settlements the iprd charge was not tax deductible and only a portion of the zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible in addition we recorded tax expense associated with the imclone acquisition as well as a discrete income tax benefit of 2103 million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the 20012004 irs audit see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2010 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 673 billion compared with 450 billion at december 31 2009 the increase in cash was driven by cash from operations of 686 billion partially offset by dividends paid of 217 billion business and product acquisitions of 110 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 6943 million 

capital expenditures of 6943 million during 2010 were 707 million less than in 2009 we expect 2011 capital expenditures to be between 800 million and 900 million as we invest in the longterm growth of our diabetes care products continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems and invest in our oncology biotechnology capabilities 

total debt at december 31 2010 was 693 billion an increase of 2644 million from december 31 2009 which was due to the 1418 million increase in the fair value of hedged debt and an increase in shortterm debt of 1307 million our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s are aa and a2 respectively our moody’s longterm debt rating was moved to a2 from a1 in november 2010 our ratings outlook from both moody’s and standard and poor’s is stable 

dividends of 196 per share were paid in 2010 and 2009 2010 was the 126th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments in the fourth quarter of 2010 effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2011 the quarterly dividend was maintained at 49 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2011 of 196 per share 

as of the fourth quarter of 2010 the us and global economic recoveries proceed but face continued headwinds us economic data in the fourth quarter reflected a steady pace of economic recovery though the rate of recovery has not been sufficient to materially reduce unemployment given persistently high unemployment and little sign of nearterm inflation risk the us federal reserve has maintained its accommodative monetary policy most recently through its november 2010 announcement of expanded asset purchases the federal reserve continues its policy stance of exceptionally low rates for an extended period to stimulate lending and economic growth high sovereign debt levels and efforts at fiscal austerity in the us and other developed countries continue to be a concern for many economists and are predicted to challenge the economic recovery globally given this backdrop both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges and are taking steps to reduce the costs of care 

  

including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates in the us price cuts in government systems outside the us and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs globally we continue to monitor the potential nearterm impact of the economic environment on prescription trends the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation the federal government’s involvement in the us economy and various international government funding levels 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including debt service capital expenditures and dividends in 2011 we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowings because of the high credit quality of our short and longterm debt our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected we currently have 124 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion of which backs our commercial paper program and matures in may 2011 various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and the “financial expectations for 2011” section may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings through 2014 we expect to lose effective exclusivity for the following key products 

 

  

  

  

 cymbalta could receive an additional six months of exclusivity based on completion of pediatric studies 

gemzar has already lost effective exclusivity in the us and major european countries france germany italy spain and the united kingdom and humalog has lost exclusivity in major european countries in addition we face us patent litigation over alimta cymbalta and strattera and it is possible we could lose our effective exclusivity for one or more of these products prior to the expiration of the relevant patents see the hatchwaxman patent litigation discussion in note 15 and in the “legal and regulatory matters” section below revenue from alimta cymbalta humalog and zyprexa contribute materially to our results of operations liquidity and financial position the loss of exclusivity would likely result in generic competition generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations however our goal is to partially mitigate the effect on our operations liquidity and financial position through growth in our patentprotected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period in emerging markets in japan and in our animal health business our expected growth in the emerging markets and japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of patentprotected products in these markets 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2010 and 2009 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2010 and 2009 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone 

  

and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 

 

  

       

 

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2010 we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership for approximately 85 percent of our sales this is at the time products are shipped to the customer typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain the remaining sales which are outside the us are recorded at the point of delivery provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

  

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

we establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longterm care hospital patient assistance programs and various other government programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit we adjust our rebate reserves 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances us sales returns federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by 166 billion 120 billion and 103 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively a 5 percent change in the sales return medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2010 would lead to an approximate 85 million effect on our income before income taxes as of december 31 2010 our sales returns medicaid and medicare rebate liability was 8583 million 

our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet approximately 83 percent and 84 percent of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us returns rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 

 

  

  

 

  

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection in the past several years we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans in evaluating these assumptions we consider many factors including an evaluation of the discount rates expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates of other companies our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we use an actuarially determined companyspecific yield curve to determine the discount rate in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2010 annual expense would increase by 144 million a onepercentagepoint decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2010 service cost and interest cost by 117 million if the 2010 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 287 million if the 2010 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 183 million if our assumption regarding the 2010 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 333 million the us plans represent approximately 81 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 83 percent of total plan assets at december 31 2010 

impairment of indefinitelived and longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present when required a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 

there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the iprd acquired in a business combination all of which require multiple assumptions we utilize the “income method” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size patent protection historical pricing of similar products and expected industry trends the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate this analysis is performed for each project independently 

for iprd assets the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product as discussed previously in the “latestage pipeline” section 

  

the nature of the pharmaceutical business is highrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products as such it is likely that some iprd assets will become impaired at some time in the future 

the estimated future cash flows based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

income taxes 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 535 million and 237 million respectively 

financial expectations for 2011 

for the full year of 2011 we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 392 to 407 which includes the dilutive impact of the upfront fee and other anticipated expenses related to the collaboration with boehringer ingelheim but excludes potential restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce we expect that total revenue growth will be flat to slightly increasing which assumes we maintain our patent exclusivity for us strattera sales and also assumes rapid and severe erosion of global zyprexa sales after patent expirations in major markets including the us starting in october 2011 and the continued severe erosion of us gemzar sales we anticipate that the impact of us health care reform will lower 2011 revenue by 400 million to 500 million we expect these reductions in revenue to be offset by sales growth of alimta cialis cymbalta effient humalog and animal health products 

we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will decline approximately two percentage points marketing selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low to midsingle digits and include an estimated 150 million to 200 million in nontax deductible expense for the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with us health care reform while research and development expense growth is expected to be relatively flat other—net expense is expected to be a net expense of between 50 million and 150 million cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of between 800 and 900 million as well as anticipated business development activity and our dividend 

private securities litigation reform act of 1995— 

a caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we caution investors that any forwardlooking statements or projections made by us including those above are based on management’s belief at the time they are made however they are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially and will depend on among other things the continuing growth of our currently marketed products developments with competitive products the implementation of us health care reform the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches asset impairments restructurings and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired iprd charges foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions changes in effective tax rates wholesaler inventory changes other regulatory developments litigation patent disputes and government investigations the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing importation and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects are discussed earlier in this section and in item 1a “risk factors” we undertake no duty to update these forwardlooking statements 

  

legal and regulatory matters 

we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations the most significant of these are described below while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters we believe that except as specifically noted below the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 

patent litigation 

we are engaged in the following us patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we believe each of these hatchwaxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us 

 

  

  

 we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a countrybycountry basis we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

zyprexa litigation 

we were named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us and notified of other claims of individuals who have not filed suit the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the “claims” allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york edny mdl no 1596 

since june 2005 we have settled approximately 32720 claims the two primary settlements were as follows 

 

  

 we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims consisting of approximately 70 lawsuits in the us covering approximately 150 plaintiffs of which about 50 lawsuits covering about 50 plaintiffs are part of the mdl we have a trial scheduled in texas state court in august 2011 

in january 2009 we reached resolution with the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa and the state medicaid fraud control units of 36 states and the district of columbia of an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa as part of the resolution we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act for the offlabel promotion of zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia including alzheimer’s dementia between september 1999 and march 2001 we recorded a charge of 142 billion for this matter in the third quarter of 2008 and paid substantially all of this amount in 2009 as part of the settlement we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years the agreement also provides for an independent thirdparty review organization to assess and report on the company’s systems processes policies procedures and practices 

in october 2008 we reached a settlement with 32 states and the district of columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws while there was no finding that we violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted we paid 620 million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding zyprexa for a period of six years through consent decrees filed with the settling states 

we were served with lawsuits filed by the states of alaska arkansas connecticut idaho louisiana minnesota mississippi montana new mexico pennsylvania south carolina utah and west virginia alleging that zyprexa 

  

caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug we settled the zyprexarelated claims of all of these states incurring pretax charges of 2300 million in 2009 and 150 million in 2008 

in 2005 two lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa these actions were consolidated into a single lawsuit brought under certain state consumer protection statutes the federal civil rico statute and common law theories seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa treble damages punitive damages and attorneys’ fees two additional lawsuits were filed in the edny in 2006 on similar grounds as with the product liability suits these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug in september 2008 judge weinstein certified a class consisting of thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities and individual consumers and denied our motion for summary judgment in september 2010 both decisions were reversed by the second circuit court of appeals which found that the case cannot proceed as a class action and entered a judgment in our favor on plaintiffs’ overpricing claim plaintiffs are seeking review of this decision by the us supreme court an unfavorable outcome in this case could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

other product liability litigation 

we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des thimerosal and byetta approximately a third of these claims are covered by insurance subject to deductibles and coverage limits 

product liability insurance 

because of the nature of pharmaceutical products it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future in the past several years we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future

internal control over financial reporting 

dr lechleiter and mr rice provided a report on behalf of management on our internal control over financial reporting in which management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective at december 31 2010 in addition ernst  young llp as of december 31 2010 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm provided an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting you can find the full text of management’s report and ernst  young’s attestation report in item 8 and both reports are incorporated by reference in this item 

changes in internal controls 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we are pursuing a multiyear initiative to outsource some accounting transactionprocessing activities migrating to a consistent enterprise financial system across the organization and moving certain activities to newlyestablished captive shared services centers in addition we are in the process of reducing financial human resources at various locations around the world none of these initiatives is in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in our internal control over financial reporting these initiatives are expected to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting but in the shortterm may increase our risk

 item 1 business tableend  

eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment—pharmaceutical products we also have an animal health business segment whose operations are not material to our financial statements 

 

our mission is to make medicines that help people live longer healthier more active lives our strategy is to create value for all our stakeholders by accelerating the flow of innovative new medicines that provide improved outcomes for individual patients most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover develop and bring to market innovative new medicines 

 

we manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the united states puerto rico and 17 other countries our products are sold in approximately 128 countries

marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

 

pharmaceuticals—united states 

in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals public and private payers and appropriate health care professionals three wholesale distributors in the united states—amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc—each accounted for between 12 percent and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2009 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material 

 

we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are assigned to therapeutic areas such as neuroscience diabetes osteoporosis and oncology we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

 

large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups government agencies and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with these organizations which provide for discounts or rebates on one or more lilly products 

 

pharmaceuticals—outside the united states 

outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries 

 

 

  we maintain our own sales organizations but in some countries we market our products through independent distributors 

 

pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

we market certain of our significant products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 

 

  

animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors 

 

competition 

our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries 

 

important competitive factors include safety effectiveness and ease of use of our products price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new products and processes most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions decreased volume of sales or both manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products much lower than branded products accordingly when a branded pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states intellectual property protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products increasingly to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care 

 

we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others innovative costeffective medicines that provide improved outcomes to individual patients and deliver value to payers together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our discovery development manufacturing marketing and support operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors 

 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

 

overview 

intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents in the united states and many other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers 

 

 

  from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products in addition from time to time competitors or other third parties assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

 

outside the united states the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms and substantive limitations it is difficult to assess when and how much if at all we will benefit commercially from this protection 

 

when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or databased exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

 

some of our current products including erbitux forteo reopro and xigris and many of the potential products in our research pipeline are biological products “biologics” currently generic versions of biologics cannot be approved under us law competitors seeking approval of biologics must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing which typically involves more complex and costly processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations however certain health care reform bills recently debated in congress included provisions that would create a regulatory pathway to allow generic biologics under these proposals the innovator would receive databased exclusivity for a period of years following regulatory approval for marketing even in the absence of new legislation the us food and drug administration fda is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics 

 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses—particularly those products discussed below—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

 

the most relevant us patent protection together with expected expiration for our major marketed products is as follows 

 

  

  

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

 

 

  patent licenses 

most of our important products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our larger products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others 

 

  

patent challenges 

in the united states the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug—not safety and efficacy 

 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

 

in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on alimta cymbalta evista gemzar and strattera for more information on this litigation see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” 

 

outside the united states the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the united states and we expect this trend to continue for more information on significant patent challenges outside the united states see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” 

 

government regulation 

 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment 

 

 

  of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products in 2007 congress passed the food and drug administration amendments act fdaaa which imposes additional requirements for drug development and commercialization and provides the fda with further authorities and resources particularly in the area of drug safety 

 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations in recent years we have made and we continue to make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing product and process development and quality operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

 

outside the united states our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency ema in the european union and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the department of justice and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities over this period several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements see item 3 “legal proceedings” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” for information about currently pending and recently resolved marketing and promotional practices investigations involving lilly including information regarding a corporate integrity agreement entered into by lilly in connection with the resolution of a us federal marketing practices investigation and certain related state investigations involving zyprexa 

 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” prohibits certain individuals and entities including us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on us publicly traded companies as noted above outside the us our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials additionally in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore our payments to these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa recently the us securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice have increased their fcpa enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information about a currently pending investigation involving our operations in several countries 

 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in pending or future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs additional cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

 

in the us the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma provides a prescription drug benefit for seniors under the medicare program known as medicare part d pricing to manufacturers for drugs covered by the program is currently established through competitive negotiations 

 

 

  between the manufacturers and private payers in addition comprehensive health care reform was the subject of recent intense debate in congress and we expect the health care reform debate to continue although it is difficult to predict the direction of the debate the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—executive overview—legal regulatory and other matters” for more discussion of mma and us health care reform at the state level budget pressures are causing various states to impose costcontrol measures such as higher rebates and more restrictive formularies 

 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will become more severe 

 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2009 we employed approximately 7600 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 349 billion in 2007 384 billion in 2008 and 433 billion in 2009 

 

our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes obesity and musculoskeletal disorders cancer and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in a strong biotechnology research program including therapeutic proteins antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides as well as genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function biomarkers and targeted therapeutics in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients we also conduct research in animal health including animal nutrition and physiology control of parasites and veterinary medicine both food and companion animal 

 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our pharmaceutical products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

 

drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success even after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all stages of development at present we have over 60 drug candidates across all stages of human testing among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of human testing are potential therapies for diabetes cancers and alzheimer’s disease we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including compounds targeting cancers diabetes schizophrenia obesity depression sleep disorders pain alcohol dependence musculoskeletal disorders atherosclerosis and autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis we are also developing new uses formulations or delivery methods for many of these compounds as well as our currently marketed products such as alimta byetta cialis cymbalta effient erbitux forteo gemzar and humalog 

 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition byetta is manufactured by thirdparty suppliers to amylin in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally have sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative 

 

 

  source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

 

our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at five sites in the united states as well as locations in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world effective in january 2010 we sold one of our us sites tippecanoe laboratories in west lafayette indiana to an affiliate of evonik industries ag and entered into a nineyear supply and services agreement whereby evonik will manufacture final and intermediate step active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain lilly human and animal health products 

 

we manage our supply chain including our own facilities contracted arrangements and inventory in a way that should allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities extended failure of a contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

 

control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

 

executive officers of the company 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers except as otherwise noted all executive officers have been employed by the company in executive positions during the last five years 

 

the term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors to be held on april 19 2010 or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified no director or executive officer has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive officer of the company as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement there is no understanding between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected 

 

 

 

 

   

 

employees 

at the end of 2009 we employed approximately 40360 people including approximately 20300 employees outside the united states a substantial number of our employees have long records of continuous service 

 

financial information relating to business segments and classes of products 

you can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products in item 8 of this form 10k “segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference 

 

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net sales changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations in addition margins vary for our different products due to various factors including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the products the value of the products to the marketplace and government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement our major product sales are generally not seasonal 

 

financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations 

you can find financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations in item 8 “segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference to date our overall operations abroad have not been significantly deterred by local restrictions on the transfer of funds from branches and subsidiaries located abroad including the availability of us dollar exchange we cannot predict what effect these restrictions or the other risks inherent in foreign operations including possible nationalization might have on our future operations or what other restrictions may be imposed in the future in addition changing currency values can either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position

 item 1a risk factors cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements tableend  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

 

we make certain forwardlooking statements in this form 10k and company spokespersons may make such statements in the future where possible we try to identify forwardlooking statements by using such words as “expect” “plan” “will” “estimate” “forecast” “project” “believe” and “anticipate” forwardlooking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts they are likely to address our growth strategy sales of current and anticipated products financial results our research and development programs the status of product approvals legislative and regulatory developments and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations all forwardlooking statements are based on our expectations at the time we make them they are subject to risks and uncertainties including those summarized below 

 

  

 

    

 

 

1 the gemzar use patent and evista dosage form patent have been held invalid by federal district courts and we have appealed those decisions for more information see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis—legal and regulatory matters” 

 

loss of exclusivity typically results in a rapid and severe decline in sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property protection” for more details additionally if these or other significant products were to become subject to a problem such as an early loss of patent protection as a result of litigation unexpected side effects regulatory proceedings material product liability litigation publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from competitive products the adverse impact on our revenues cash flows and earnings could be significant 

 

  

intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the us the hatchwaxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our patents as a result we expect that our us patents on major products will be routinely challenged and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property protection” for more details we are increasingly facing generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the us as well in addition competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them if successful such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales see item 1 “business—patents trademarks and other intellectual property protection” for more details

other patent litigation 

cialis in july 2005 vanderbilt university filed a lawsuit in the united states district court in delaware against icos corporation seeking to add three of its scientists as coinventors on the cialis compound and methodofuse patents in january 2009 the district court judge ruled in our favor declining to add any of these scientists as an inventor on either patent the plaintiff appealed this ruling to the court of appeals for the federal circuit which heard oral arguments in november 2009 we await the court’s decision we believe these claims are without legal merit and expect to prevail in the appeal however it is not possible to determine the outcome an unfavorable final outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position

legal regulatory and other matters 

in september 2009 we set a goal to reduce our expected cost structure by 1 billion by the end of 2011 we also plan to lower global headcount to 35000 by the end of 2011 excluding strategic sales force additions in highgrowth emerging markets and japan which could result in future periodic restructuring charges 

 

in january 2009 we reached resolution with the office of the us attorney for the edpa and the state medicaid fraud control units of 36 states and the district of columbia of an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa we recorded a charge of 142 billion for this matter in the third quarter of 2008 in 2009 we paid substantially all of this amount as required by the settlement agreements in addition in october 2008 we reached a settlement with 32 states and the district of columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws under which we paid 620 million however we were served with lawsuits brought by attorneys general of a number of states alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug and seeking to recover the costs paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drugbenefit programs as well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be incurred to treat zyprexarelated illnesses in 2009 we incurred pretax charges of 2300 million reflecting the probable and estimable exposures in connection with these claims we have reached settlements or are in advanced discussions to settle all of the remaining state claims the pennsylvania case is set for trial in april 2010 in state court 

 

health care reform is currently the subject of intense debate in the us congress the impact of reform on the pharmaceutical industry is uncertain most reform proposals intend to provide coverage for the uninsured include increasing existing price rebates in federally funded health care programs and the expansion of rebates or other pharmaceutical company discounts into new programs there are also proposals that will impose new fees on pharmaceutical industry sales of certain prescription pharmaceutical products certain federal and state health care reform proposals that go beyond providing additional health insurance coverage for the uninsured may also place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices these proposals include reducing incentives for employersponsored health care 

 

 

  the creation of an independent commission to propose changes to medicare with a particular focus on the cost of biopharmaceuticals in medicare part d which lowers the projections for future government spending in medicare and a governmentrun public option with biopharmaceutical pricesetting capabilities additionally various proposals could legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow or require the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers in addition the federal government is considering creating an expedited regulatory approval pathway for biosimilars copies of biological compounds for biologic products in the us the proposals vary as to which biologic products would be eligible how quickly a biosimilar might reach the market and the ability to interchange the biosimilar and the original biologic product at the pharmacy we expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to become more severe which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

 

in its budget submission to congress in february 2010 the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of usbased companies while it is uncertain how the us congress may address this issue reform of us taxation including taxation of international income continues to be a topic of discussion for the us congress a significant change to the us tax system including changes to the taxation of international income could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection these proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact given the effect of the downturn in the global economy on local governments

we incurred tax expense of 7643 million in 2008 despite having a loss before income taxes of 131 billion our net loss was driven by the 469 billion acquired iprd charge for imclone and the 148 billion zyprexa investigation settlements the iprd charge was not tax deductible and only a portion of the zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible in addition we recorded tax expense associated with the imclone acquisition as well as a discrete income tax benefit of 2103 million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the 20012004 irs audit the effective tax rate was 238 percent in 2007 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2009 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 450 billion compared with 593 billion at december 31 2008 the decrease in cash was driven by a reduction in shortterm borrowings of 582 billion and dividends paid of 215 billion partially offset by cash from operations of 434 billion which included payments related to the zyprexa edpa settlement of 139 billion and proceeds of longterm debt issuances of 240 billion 

 

capital expenditures of 7650 million during 2009 were 1822 million less than in 2008 we expect 2010 capital expenditures to be approximately 10 billion as we invest in our biotechnology capabilities continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems and invest in the longterm growth of our diabetes care products 

 

total debt at december 31 2009 was 666 billion a decrease of 380 billion from december 31 2008 reflecting the paydown of our commercial paper that was issued to finance our acquisition of imclone partially offset by 240 billion of longterm debt we issued in march 2009 our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s remain at aa and a1 respectively 

 

 

  dividends of 196 per share were paid in 2009 an increase of 4 percent from 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2009 effective for the firstquarter dividend in 2010 the quarterly dividend was maintained at 49 per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2010 of 196 per share the year 2009 was the 125th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments 

 

despite increasing unemployment and declines in real consumer spending consumer confidence has grown and job losses have slowed during the second half of 2009 many financial institutions continue to have tightened lines of credit thus reducing funding available to stimulate nearterm economic growth while there are some positive signs the prospects for recovery are uncertain pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns however an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall prescriptions corresponding to the growth of the uninsured and underinsured population in the us in addition both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs we continue to monitor the potential nearterm impact of prescription trends the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers the evolving health care debate the federal government’s involvement in the economic crisis and various international government funding levels 

 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including debt service capital expenditures costs associated with litigation and government investigations and dividends in 2010 we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowings our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the illiquidity in the markets because of the high credit quality of our short and longterm debt we currently have 124 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion of which backs our commercial paper program and matures in may 2011 various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

 

we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues cash flows and earnings in the next three years we will lose effective exclusivity for zyprexa in major european countries september 2011 and the us october 2011 and for humalog in major european countries november 2010 gemzar has already lost effective exclusivity in major european countries in addition we face us patent litigation over several key patentprotected products whose exclusivity extends beyond 2012 including alimta cymbalta evista gemzar and strattera and it is possible we could face an unexpected loss of our effective exclusivity for one or more of these products prior to the end of 2012 revenue from each of these products contributes materially to our results of operations liquidity and financial position and the loss of exclusivity could result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product however we plan to mitigate the effect on our operations liquidity and financial position through growth in our remaining business and the previously announced plan to reduce our expected cost structure by 1 billion by the end of 2011 

 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2009 and 2008 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 

  respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

  the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2009 we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership for more than 85 percent of our sales this is at the time products are shipped to the customer typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain the remaining sales which are outside the us are recorded at the point of delivery provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

 

we establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales once the product is returned it is destroyed consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longtermcare hospital patient assistance programs and various other government programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country a best estimate of these 

 

 

  rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit we adjust our rebate reserves 

 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances us sales returns federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by 120 billion 103 billion and 7388 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively a 5 percent change in the sales return medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2009 would lead to an approximate 60 million effect on our income before income taxes as of december 31 2009 our sales returns medicaid and medicare rebate liability was 6923 million 

 

our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet approximately 84 percent and 80 percent of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us returns rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection in the past few years we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future 

 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

 

periodically we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans in evaluating these assumptions we consider many factors including an evaluation of the discount rates expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend 

 

 

  rates of other companies our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately 88 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we use an actuarially determined companyspecific yield curve to determine the discount rate in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

 

we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2009 annual expense would increase by 189 million a onepercentagepoint decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2009 service cost and interest cost by 158 million if the 2009 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 236 million if the 2009 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by 168 million if our assumption regarding the 2009 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by 277 million the us plans represent approximately 82 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 83 percent of total plan assets at december 31 2009 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted the estimated future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

 

income taxes 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

 

we believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of 418 million and 418 million respectively 

 

financial expectations for 2010 

 

for the full year of 2010 we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 465 to 485 excluding the potential impact of health care reform in the us and restructuring charges resulting from previously announced strategic headcount reductions we expect volumedriven revenue growth in the highsingle digits driven primarily by alimta cymbalta humalog cialis effient and the exenatide franchise we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be flat to declining marketing selling and 

 

 

  administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low to midsingle digits while research and development expenses are projected to grow in the lowdouble digits other—net expense income is expected to be a net expense of between 1500 million and 2000 million cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately 10 billion anticipated business development activity and our dividend 

 

we caution investors that any forwardlooking statements or projections made by us including those above are based on management’s belief at the time they are made however they are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially and will depend on among other things the continuing growth of our currently marketed products developments with competitive products the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches asset impairments restructurings and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired inprocess research and development charges foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions changes in effective tax rates wholesaler inventory changes other regulatory developments litigation patent disputes and government investigations and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing importation and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals as well as proposed health care reform currently being discussed by the us congress we undertake no duty to update these forwardlooking statements 

 

legal and regulatory matters 

 

we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations the most significant of these are described below while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters we believe that except as specifically noted below the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 

 

patent litigation 

we are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 

 

  

 

    

  

we believe each of these hatchwaxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us 

 

  

we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a countrybycountry basis we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

 

xigris and evista in june 2002 ariad pharmaceuticals inc ariad the massachusetts institute of technology the whitehead institute for biomedical research and the president and fellows of harvard 

 

 

  college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts sued us alleging that sales of two of our products xigris and evista were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products following jury and bench trials on separate issues the us district court of massachusetts entered final judgment in september 2007 that ariad’s claims were valid infringed and enforceable and finding damages in the amount of 65 million plus a 23 percent royalty on net us sales of xigris and evista since the time of the jury decision however the court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal are exhausted in april 2009 the court of appeals for the federal circuit overturned the district court judgment concluding that ariad’s asserted patent claims are invalid in august 2009 the court of appeals agreed to review this decision en banc thereby vacating the court of appeals decision the en banc hearing occurred in december 2009 and we are awaiting a decision nevertheless we believe that these allegations are without legal merit that we will ultimately prevail on these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 

 

zyprexa litigation 

we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the “claims” allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 1596 

 

since june 2005 we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims the agreements cover a total of approximately 32670 claimants including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims the two primary settlements were as follows 

 

  

we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 170 lawsuits in the us covering approximately 260 plaintiffs of which about 140 cases covering about 150 plaintiffs are part of the mdl the mdl cases have been scheduled for trial in groups and no specific trial dates for trial groups have been assigned we also have trials scheduled in texas state court in may and august 2010 and in ohio in august 2010 

 

in january 2009 we reached resolution with the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa and the state medicaid fraud control units of 36 states and the district of columbia of an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa as part of the resolution we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act for the offlabel promotion of zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia including alzheimer’s dementia between september 1999 and march 2001 we recorded a charge of 142 billion for this matter in the third quarter of 2008 in 2009 we paid substantially all of this amount as required by the settlement agreements as part of the settlement we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years the agreement also provides for an independent thirdparty review organization to assess and report on the company’s systems processes policies procedures and practices 

 

in october 2008 we reached a settlement with 32 states and the district of columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws while there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted we accrued and paid 620 million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding zyprexa for a period of six years through consent decrees filed with the settling states 

 

we have been served with lawsuits filed by the states of alaska arkansas connecticut idaho louisiana minnesota mississippi montana new mexico pennsylvania south carolina utah and west virginia alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug these suits seek to recover the costs paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drugbenefit programs as well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be incurred by the states to treat zyprexarelated illnesses the connecticut idaho louisiana minnesota mississippi montana new mexico and west virginia cases are part of the mdl proceedings in the edny 

 

 

  the alaska case was settled in march 2008 for a payment of 150 million plus terms designed to ensure subject to certain limitations and conditions that alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims we are in advanced discussions with the attorneys general for several of these states seeking to resolve their zyprexarelated claims and we have agreed to settlements with the states of arkansas connecticut idaho mississippi new mexico south carolina utah and west virginia in the second and third quarters of 2009 we incurred pretax charges of 1050 million and 1250 million respectively reflecting the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection with these claims the pennsylvania case is set for trial in april 2010 in state court 

 

in 2005 two lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes the federal civil rico statute and common law theories seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa treble damages punitive damages and attorneys’ fees two additional lawsuits were filed in the edny in 2006 on similar grounds in september 2008 judge weinstein certified a class consisting of thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities and individual consumers we appealed the certification order and judge weinstein’s order denying our motion for summary judgment in september 2008 while the second circuit court of appeals heard oral arguments on the appeal in december 2009 no opinions have been rendered in 2007 the pennsylvania employees trust fund brought claims in state court in pennsylvania as insurer of pennsylvania state employees who were prescribed zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the new york cases as with the product liability suits these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug in december 2009 the court granted our summary judgment motion dismissing the case plaintiffs have appealed this decision 

 

in early 2005 we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec and a second has been certified in ontario and includes all canadian residents except for residents of quebec and british columbia the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the product liability litigation pending in the us we are in advanced discussions to resolve all zyprexa classaction litigation in canada 

 

we cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

other product liability litigation 

we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des thimerosal and byetta the majority of these claims are covered by insurance subject to deductibles and coverage limits 

 

product liability insurance 

because of the nature of pharmaceutical products it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future in the past several years we have been unable to attain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future 

 

private securities litigation reform act of 1995— a caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

 

under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we caution investors that any forwardlooking statements or projections made by us including those made in this document are based on management’s expectations at the time they are made but they are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected economic competitive governmental technological legal and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects are discussed earlier in this section and in item 1a “risk factors” we undertake no duty to update forwardlooking statements

disclosure controls and procedures 

under applicable securities and exchange commission sec regulations management of a reporting company with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer must periodically evaluate the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” which are defined generally as controls and other procedures of a reporting company designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the reporting company in its periodic reports filed with the sec such as this form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported on a timely basis 

 

our management with the participation of john c lechleiter phd chairman president and chief executive officer and derica w rice executive vice president global services and chief financial officer evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2009 and concluded that they are effective

 item 1 business tableend  

eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” which may be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment − pharmaceutical products we also have an animal health business segment whose operations are not material to our financial statements we manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the united states puerto rico and 25 other countries our products are sold in approximately 135 countries 

 

most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products we direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat human diseases we also conduct research to find products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production

marketing 

 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

  pharmaceuticals − united states 

 

in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals public and private payers and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country three wholesale distributors in the united states − amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation − each accounted for between 12 and 16 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2008 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material 

 

we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical and drug journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are assigned to therapeutic areas such as neuroscience diabetes osteoporosis and oncology we supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations as appropriate to leverage our own resources and the strengths of our partners in various markets 

 

large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups government agencies and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we maintain special business groups to service wholesalers managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with a number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more lilly products 

 

pharmaceuticals − outside the united states 

 

outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales organizations in some countries however we market our products through independent distributors 

 

pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

 

we market certain of our significant products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 

 

 3 

   

animal health products 

 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states to market animal health products elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors 

 

competition 

 

our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries 

 

important competitive factors include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service and research and development of new products and processes if competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic versions of our products increasingly to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care 

 

we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others innovative costeffective products that serve unmet medical needs together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our discovery development manufacturing marketing and support operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors 

 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

 

overview 

 

intellectual property protection is in the aggregate material to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents both in the united states and in other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products in addition from time to time competitors or other third parties assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

 

outside the united states the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms and substantive 

  limitations it is still too soon to assess when and how much if at all we will benefit commercially from these changes 

 

when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or databased exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

 

some of our products including erbitux forteo reopro and xigris are biological products or biologics additionally many of the potential products in our research pipeline are biologics currently generic versions of biologics cannot be approved under us law competitors seeking approval of biologics must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing which involves more complex and costly processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations however the law could change in the future to allow generic biologics even in the absence of new legislation the us food and drug administration fda is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics 

 

our intellectual property portfolio 

 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses − particularly those products discussed below − to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

 

the most relevant us patent protection together with expected expiration for our major marketed products is as follows 

 

  

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

 

patent licenses 

 

most of our important products were discovered in our own laboratories and are not subject to significant license agreements two of our larger products cialis and alimta are subject to patent assignments or licenses granted to us by others

patent challenges 

 

in the united states the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biologics without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug − not safety and efficacy 

 

absent a patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30 to 42month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the ndalisted patents are challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

 

in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue in addition generic companies have shown an increasing willingness to launch “at risk” ie after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on alimta cymbalta evista gemzar and strattera for more information on these see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis − legal and regulatory matters” 

 

outside the united states the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely in recent years we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the united states and we expect this trend to continue for more information on significant patent challenges outside the united states see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis − legal and regulatory matters” 

 

government regulation 

 

regulation of our operations 

 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex 

  federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment 

 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products in 2007 congress passed the food and drug administration amendments act fdaaa of 2007 which imposes additional requirements for drug development and commercialization and provides the fda with further authorities and resources particularly in the area of drug safety 

 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations in recent years we have made and we continue to make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing product and process development and quality operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

 

outside the united states our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency emea in the european union and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the department of justice and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies and increased the interagency coordination of enforcement activities over this period several claims brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis − legal and regulatory matters” for information about currently pending and recently resolved marketing and promotional practices investigations involving lilly including information regarding a corporate integrity agreement entered into by lilly in connection with the resolution of a us federal marketing practices investigation and certain related state investigations involving zyprexa 

 

it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in pending or future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 

 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

  in the us the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma took effect in 2006 providing a prescription drug benefit for seniors under the medicare program known as medicare part d pricing to manufacturers for drugs covered by the program is currently established through competitive negotiations between the manufacturers and private payers however various measures have been proposed that would allow or require the federal government to negotiate medicare part d drug prices directly with manufacturers in addition various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay to the government see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis − executive overview − legal regulatory and other matters” for more discussion of mma and other federal healthcare cost containment measures at the state level budget pressures are causing various states to impose costcontrol measures such as higher rebates and more restrictive formularies 

 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will become more severe 

 

research and development 

 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2008 we employed approximately 8600 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 313 billion in 2006 349 billion in 2007 and 384 billion in 2008 

 

our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes obesity and musculoskeletal disorders cancer and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in a strong biotechnology research program including therapeutic proteins antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides as well as genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function biomarkers and targeted therapeutics in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses formulations and therapeutic approaches that can provide additional benefits to patients we also conduct research in animal health including animal nutrition and physiology control of parasites and veterinary medicine both food and companion animal 

 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

 

drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or commercial success even after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new 

  compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all stages of development among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for acute coronary syndromes diabetes osteoporosis and cancer further we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including compounds targeting cancers diabetes obesity musculoskeletal disorders lipid abnormalities alzheimer’s disease schizophrenia multiple sclerosis depression sleep disorders pain and migraine attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd alcoholism and autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis at present we have approximately 60 drug candidates across all stages of clinical development we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of these compounds as well as our currently marketed products such as alimta byetta cialis cymbalta erbitux forteo gemzar and zyprexa 

 

raw materials and product supply 

 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition byetta is manufactured by thirdparty suppliers to amylin in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product we generally have sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of a supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

 

our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in indiana as well as locations in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world 

 

we seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

 

quality assurance 

 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

 

control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

  executive officers of the company 

 

the following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers all executive officers except mr azar have been employed by the company in executive positions during the last five years 

 

the term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors to be held on april 20 2009 or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified no director or executive officer of the company has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive officer of the company as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement there is no understanding between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected 

 

 

 

employees 

 

at the end of 2008 we employed approximately 40500 people including approximately 19600 employees outside the united states a substantial number of our employees have long records of continuous service 

 

financial information relating to business segments and classes of products 

 

you can find financial information relating to our business segments and classes of products in part ii item 8 of this form 10k “segment information” that information is incorporated here by reference 

 

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net sales changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations in addition margins vary for our different products due to various factors including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the products the value of the products to the marketplace and government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement our major product sales are generally not seasonal 

 

financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations

  neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us beginning in the 1930s we purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to thimerosal in the 1920s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the majority of the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies

financial results 

 

we achieved worldwide sales growth of 9 percent which was primarily driven by volume increases in several key products the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales contributed to an improvement in gross margin marketing selling and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as sales driven by prelaunch activities associated with prasugrel marketing costs associated with cymbalta and evista the impact of foreign exchange rates and increased litigationrelated expenses while our investment in research and development grew 10 percent we completed our acquisition of imclone systems inc imclone resulting in a significant charge of 469 billion for acquired inprocess research and development iprd and reached resolution on government investigations related to our past us marketing and promotional practices for zyprexa resulting in an additional charge of 148 billion we incurred tax expense of 7643 million despite a loss before income taxes of 131 billion primarily caused by the nondeductibility of the imclone iprd charge and the partial deductibility of the zyprexa investigation settlements accordingly earnings decreased 502 billion to a net loss of 207 billion and earnings per share decreased 460 to a loss of 189 per share in 2008 as compared with net income of 295 billion or earnings per share of 271 in 2007 net income comparisons between 2008 and 2007 are affected by the impact of the following significant items see notes 3 5 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

legal regulatory and other matters 

 

in march 2004 we were notified by the us attorney’s office for the edpa that it had commenced an investigation relating to our us marketing and promotional practices for zyprexa prozac and prozac weekly tm  in october 2008 we announced that we were in advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by the edpa and we recorded a charge of 142 billion in january 2009 we announced that the discussions had been successfully concluded and that we settled the zyprexarelated federal claims as well as similar medicaidrelated claims of states which decide to participate in the settlement 

 

beginning in august 2006 we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws seeking documents pertaining to zyprexa in 

  october 2008 we reached a settlement with 32 states and the district of columbia under which we paid 620 million 

 

in december 2008 the federal supreme court bgh in germany reestablished our zyprexa patent that had been declared invalid in 2007 by the german federal patent court as a result of this ruling generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the german market as of the beginning of 2009

in the third quarter of 2008 we initiated a strategic review of our tippecanoe manufacturing facility in lafayette indiana options being considered for this site include continuing operations with a revised site mission exploring opportunities to sell the facility and ceasing operations altogether the review is expected to last six to twelve months no final decisions have been made at this time however depending on the decision we could record significant charges 

 

in the united states the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma continues to provide an effective prescription drug benefit under the medicare program known as medicare part d various measures have been discussed andor passed in both the us house of representatives and us senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow or require the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers additionally various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to medicaid patients or impose additional rebates on sales to patients who receive their medicines through medicare part d uncertainty exists surrounding the new administration and congress and the impact any government decisions or programs will have on the pharmaceutical industry in addition many states are facing substantial budget difficulties due to the downturn in the economy and are expected to seek aggressive cuts or other offsets in healthcare spending we expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to become more severe which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection

financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2008 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 593 billion compared with 483 billion at december 31 2007 cash flow from operations in 2008 of 730 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of debt of 441 billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of 608 billion dividends paid of 206 billion purchases of property and equipment of 9472 million and net purchases of noncurrent investments of 8151 million 

 

capital expenditures of 9472 million during 2008 were 1352 million less than in 2007 we expect 2009 capital expenditures to be approximately 11 billion as we invest in our biotechnology capabilities continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems and invest in the longterm growth of our diabetes care products 

 

 

total debt as of december 31 2008 increased 545 billion to 1046 billion reflecting the commercial paper we issued in november 2008 primarily to finance our acquisition of imclone offset by longterm debt repayments and paydown of commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s are at aa and a1 respectively 

 

dividends of 188 per share were paid in 2008 an increase of 11 percent from 2007 in the fourth quarter of 2008 effective for the firstquarter dividend in 2009 the quarterly dividend was increased to 49 per share a 43 percent increase resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2009 of 196 per share the year 2008 was the 

  124th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 41st consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 

 

 

in recent months global economic conditions have deteriorated triggered by the liquidity crisis in the capital markets the implications have become more widespread resulting in higher unemployment and declines in real consumer spending in addition many financial institutions have tightened lines of credit reducing funding available for nearterm economic growth pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns however an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall prescriptions corresponding with the growth of the uninsured and underinsured population in the us in addition both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs we continue to monitor the potential nearterm impact of prescription trends the credit worthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers the decline of health insurance coverage in the overall population and the federal government’s involvement in the economic crisis 

 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including debt service capital expenditures costs associated with litigation and government investigations and dividends in 2009 we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowings our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market because of the high credit quality of our short and longterm debt in 2009 we intend to fund payments required in connection with the edpa settlements and to further reduce outstanding commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand cash generated from operations and the issuance of longterm debt we currently have 124 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion of which backs our commercial paper program additionally in november 2008 we obtained a oneyear shortterm revolving credit facility in the amount of 400 billion as backup alternative financing various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in the financial expectations for 2009 section may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

  

 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2008 and 2007 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2008 and 2007 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses 

  results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2008 we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

  application of critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

 

revenue recognition and sales return rebate and discount accruals 

 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership for more than 90 percent of our sales this is at the time products are shipped to the customer typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain the remaining sales which are outside the us are recorded at the point of delivery provisions for returns rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations in the us the current structure of our arrangements eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our wholesalers when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 

 

we establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net sales once the product is returned it is destroyed consistent with sfas 48 revenue recognition when right of return exists we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future product returns related to those sales this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates actual product returns have been approximately one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longtermcare hospital patient assistance programs and various other government programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 

 

the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related 

  to that sale is typically paid up to six months later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit we adjust our rebate reserves 

 

we believe that our accruals for sales returns rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances sales returns federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by 103 billion 7388 million and 7048 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively a 5 percent change in the sales return medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2008 would lead to an approximate 52 million effect on our income before income taxes as of december 31 2008 our sales returns medicaid and medicare rebate liability was 6185 million 

 

our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet approximately 80 percent and 78 percent of our global sales return rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us returns rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurers and the possibility of and length of time for collection in the past few years we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future 

  the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

 

periodically we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans in evaluating these assumptions we consider many factors including an evaluation of the discount rates expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates of other companies our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately 88 percent to 92 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we use an actuarially determined companyspecific yield curve to determine the discount rate in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

 

we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2008 annual expense would increase by approximately 27 million a onepercentagepoint decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2008 service cost and interest cost by approximately 21 million if the 2008 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by approximately 26 million if the 2008 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by approximately 17 million if our assumption regarding the 2008 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately 28 million the us plans represent approximately 83 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 84 percent of total plan assets at december 31 2008 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted the estimated future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the 

  position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

 

we believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately 432 million and 423 million respectively 

 

financial expectations for 2009 

 

for the full year of 2009 we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 400 to 425 we expect volume growth in sales again in 2009 driven by cymbalta alimta cialis humalog and the anticipated launches of prasugrel as well as by the elanco animal health division however the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies worldwide pricing pressures and the impact of generic competition in certain markets for gemzar are anticipated to partially offset these positive impacts as a result we expect midsingle digit sales growth we expect gross margin as a percent of net sales to increase driven by the strengthening dollar this increase could be more pronounced in the first half of 2009 marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to show flat to lowsingle digit growth research and development expenses are projected to grow in the lowdouble digits other — net is expected to be a net loss of between 200 million and 250 million capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 11 billion and we expect continued strong operating cash flow 

 

actual results could differ materially and will depend on among other things the continuing growth of our currently marketed products developments with competitive products the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches asset impairments restructurings and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired inprocess research and development charges foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions changes in effective tax rates wholesaler inventory changes other regulatory developments litigation and government investigations and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing importation and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals we undertake no duty to update these forwardlooking statements 

 

legal and regulatory matters 

 

we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations the most significant of these are described below while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters we believe that except as specifically noted below the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 

  patent litigation 

 

we are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 

 

  

we believe each of these hatchwaxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

  we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us 

 

  

we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a countrybycountry basis we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

 

xigris and evista in june 2002 ariad pharmaceuticals inc the massachusetts institute of technology the whitehead institute for biomedical research and the president and fellows of harvard college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts sued us alleging that sales of two of our products xigris and evista were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products on may 4 2006 a jury in boston issued an initial decision in the case that xigris and evista sales infringe the patent the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately 65 million in damages calculated by applying a 23 percent royalty to all us sales of xigris and evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial in addition a separate bench trial with the us district court of massachusetts was held in august 2006 on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes in june 2005 the united states patent and trademark office uspto commenced a reexamination of the patent and in august 2007 took the position that the ariad claims at issue are unpatentable a position that ariad continues to contest in september 2007 the court entered a final judgment indicating that ariad’s claims are patentable valid and enforceable and finding damages in the amount of 65 million plus a 23 percent royalty on net us sales of xigris and evista since the time of the jury decision however the court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted we have appealed this 

  judgment the court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal on february 6 2009 we believe that these allegations are without legal merit that we will ultimately prevail on these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 

 

government investigations and related litigation 

 

in march 2004 the office of the us attorney for the edpa advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors with respect to zyprexa prozac and prozac weekly in addition the state medicaid fraud control units of more than 30 states coordinated with the edpa in its investigation of any medicaidrelated claims relating to our marketing and promotion of zyprexa in january 2009 we announced that we reached resolution of this matter as part of the resolution we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act and agreed to pay 6150 million the misdemeanor plea is for the offlabel promotion of zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia including alzheimer’s dementia between september 1999 and march 2001 we have also entered into a settlement agreement resolving the federal civil claims under which we will pay approximately 4380 million although we do not admit to the allegations we have also agreed to settle the civil investigations brought by the state medicaid fraud control units of the states that have coordinated with the edpa in its investigation and will make available a maximum amount of approximately 3620 million for payment to those states that agree to settle the charge we recorded for this matter in the third quarter of 142 billion will be sufficient to cover these payments also as part of the settlement we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs this agreement will require us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years the agreement also provides for an independent thirdparty review organization to assess and report on the company’s systems processes policies procedures and practices 

 

in june 2005 we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general medicaid fraud control unit of the state of florida seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa in september 2006 we received a subpoena from the california attorney general’s office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain zyprexa’s status on california’s formulary marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa and remuneration of health care providers we expect these matters to be resolved if florida and california participate in the state component of the edpa resolution 

 

beginning in august 2006 we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws most of these requests became part of a multistate investigative effort coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general in october 2008 we reached a settlement with 32 states and the district of columbia while there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted we paid 620 million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding zyprexa for a period of six years through consent decrees filed in the settling states the 32 states participating in the settlement are alabama arizona california delaware florida hawaii illinois indiana iowa kansas maine maryland massachusetts michigan missouri nebraska nevada new jersey new york north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania rhode island south dakota tennessee texas vermont washington and wisconsin 

 

product liability and related litigation 

 

we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the “claims” allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug almost all of the 

  federal lawsuits are part of a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 1596 

 

since june 2005 we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims the agreements cover a total of approximately 32670 claimants including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims the two primary settlements were as follows 

 

  

the 2005 settlement totaling 7000 million was paid during 2005 the january 2007 settlements were paid during 2007 

 

we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 105 lawsuits in the us covering approximately 120 plaintiffs of which about 80 cases covering about 90 plaintiffs are part of the mdl no trials have been scheduled related to these claims 

 

in early 2005 we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec and a second has been certified in ontario and includes all canadian residents except for residents of quebec and british columbia the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the us 

 

since the beginning of 2005 we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of 161 billion for zyprexa product liability matters the net charges which take into account our actual insurance recoveries covered the following 

 

  

in december 2004 we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york edny in these actions the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drugbenefit programs as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexarelated illnesses we have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of alaska arkansas connecticut idaho minnesota mississippi montana new mexico pennsylvania south carolina utah and west virginia in the courts of the respective states the connecticut louisiana minnesota mississippi montana new mexico and west virginia cases are part of the mdl proceedings in the edny the alaska case was settled in march 2008 for a payment of 150 million plus terms designed to ensure subject to certain limitations and conditions that alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims the following cases have been set for trial in 2009 connecticut in the edny in june pennsylvania in november and south carolina in august in their respective states 

 

in 2005 two lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes the federal civil rico statute and common law theories seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa treble damages punitive damages and attorneys’ fees two additional lawsuits were filed in the edny in 2006 on similar grounds in september 

  2008 judge weinstein certified a class consisting of thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities and individual consumers we appealed the certification order and judge weinstein’s order denying our motion for summary judgment in september 2008 in 2007 the pennsylvania employees trust fund brought claims in state court in pennsylvania as insurer of pennsylvania state employees who were prescribed zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the new york cases as with the product liability suits these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug the pennsylvania case is set for trial in october 2009 

 

we cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

in addition we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal the majority of these claims are covered by insurance subject to deductibles and coverage limits 

 

because of the nature of pharmaceutical products it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future in the past few years we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future

 item 1 business tableend  

eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” which may be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment – pharmaceutical products we also have an animal health business segment whose operations are not material to our financial statements we manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the united states puerto rico and 25 other countries our products are sold in approximately 135 countries 

 

most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products we direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat human diseases we also conduct research to find products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production

marketing 

 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

 

pharmaceuticals – united states 

 

in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals public and private payers and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country three wholesale distributors in the united states – amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation – each accounted for between 12 and 16 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2007 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material 

  we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals we advertise in medical and drug journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are assigned to therapeutic areas such as neuroscience diabetes osteoporosis and oncology we sometimes supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations 

 

large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups government agencies and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we have created special business groups to service wholesalers managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospitals and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with a number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more lilly products 

 

pharmaceuticals – outside the united states 

 

outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales organizations in some countries however we market our products through independent distributors 

 

pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

 

several of our significant products are marketed in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 

 

  

we have also entered into licensing arrangements under which we have granted exclusive marketing rights to other companies in specified countries for certain older products manufactured by us such as ceclor and vancocin 

 

animal health products 

 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states to market animal health products elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors 

 

competition 

 

our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries 

  important competitive factors include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service and research and development of new products and processes if competitors introduce new products delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded product loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic versions of our products increasingly to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care 

 

we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others innovative costeffective products that serve unmet medical needs together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our discovery development manufacturing marketing and support operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors 

 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

 

overview 

 

intellectual property protection is in the aggregate material to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents both in the united states and in other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products in addition from time to time competitors or other third parties assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them or allege a thirdparty right of ownership in our existing intellectual property 

 

outside the united states the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners because of trips transition provisions dispute resolution mechanisms and substantive limitations it is still too soon to assess when and how much if at all we will benefit commercially from these changes 

 

when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or databased exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

 

our intellectual property portfolio 

 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses – particularly those products discussed below – to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the 

  compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

 

the most relevant us patent protection together with expected expiration for our major marketed products is as follows 

 

  

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

 

patent challenges under the hatchwaxman act 

 

the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws in the united states before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the food and drug administration fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biological products without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug – not safety and efficacy 

 

absent a successful patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents if one or more of the ndalisted patents are successfully challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

 

in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on evista gemzar and strattera for more information on these see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis – legal and regulatory matters” 

  government regulation 

 

regulation of our operations 

 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment 

 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products in 2007 congress passed the food and drug administration amendments act fdaaa of 2007 which imposes additional requirements for drug development and commercialization and provides the fda with further authorities and resources particularly in the area of drug safety 

 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations in recent years we have made and we continue to make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing product and process development and quality operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

 

outside the united states our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency emea in the european union and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years the fda the department of justice and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies over this period several cases brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements several pharmaceutical companies including lilly are currently subject to proceedings by one or more of these agencies regarding marketing and promotional practices see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis – legal and regulatory matters” for information about currently pending marketing and promotional practices investigations in which we are involved it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in such an action could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

  regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 

 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

 

in the us implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma providing a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program took effect january 1 2006 see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis – executive overview – legal regulatory and other matters” for more discussion of mma and other federal healthcare cost containment measures at the state level budget pressures are causing various states to impose costcontrol measures such as higher rebates and more restrictive formularies 

 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls limit access to or reimbursement for our products or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will continue to increase 

 

research and development 

 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2007 we employed approximately 8000 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 303 billion in 2005 313 billion in 2006 and 349 billion in 2007 

 

our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes obesity and musculoskeletal disorders cancer and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving recombinant dna therapeutic proteins and antibodies as well as genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function biomarkers and targeted therapeutics in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients we also conduct research in animal health including animal nutrition and physiology control of parasites and veterinary medicine both food and companion animal 

 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

 

drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or 

  longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or commercial success even after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all stages of development among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for acute coronary syndromes diabetes osteoporosis and cancer further we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including compounds targeting cancers diabetes obesity alzheimer’s disease schizophrenia multiple sclerosis depression sleep disorders pain and migraine attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd alcoholism thrombotic disorders and rheumatoid arthritis at present we have approximately 45 drug candidates across all stages of clinical development we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of these compounds as well as our currently marketed products such as zyprexa cymbalta byetta gemzar alimta cialis and forteo 

 

raw materials and product supply 

 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition four of our significant products are manufactured by others actos by takeda reopro by centocor xigris by lonza biologics bulk product and dsm nv finished product and byetta by thirdparty suppliers to amylin if we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

 

our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in indiana as well as locations in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world 

 

we seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

 

quality assurance 

 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

 

control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers

other product liability litigation 

 

we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability lawsuits in the united states involving primarily zyprexa diethylstilbestrol “des” and thimerosal 

 

in approximately 85 us actions involving approximately 140 claimants plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed des during pregnancy 

 

we have been named as a defendant in approximately 220 actions in the us involving approximately 310 claimants brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us beginning in the 1930s we purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to thimerosal in the 1920s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the majority of the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies 

 

other marketing practices investigations 

 

in february 2006 we reached a settlement of an investigation by the office of consumer litigation department of justice related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to evista as part of the settlement we agreed to plead guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act the plea was for the offlabel promotion of evista during 1998 the government did not charge the company with any unlawful intent nor do we acknowledge any such intent in connection with the overall settlement we paid a total of 360 million in addition as part of the settlement a civil consent decree requires us to continue to have a compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations related to evista for five years

executive overview 

 

this section provides an overview of our financial results significant business development recent product and latestage pipeline developments and legal regulatory and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 

 

financial results 

 

we achieved worldwide sales growth of 19 percent this growth was primarily driven by volume increases in a number of key products with a significant portion of this increase in volume resulting from the acquisition of icos our additional investments in marketing and selling expenses in support of key products primarily cymbalta ® and the diabetes care products contributed to this sales growth and enabled us to increase our investment in research and development 11 percent in 2007 while cost of sales and operating expenses in the aggregate grew at approximately the same rate as sales other income — net decreased and the effective tax rate increased as a result net income and earnings per share increased 11 percent to 295 billion or 271 per share in 2007 as compared with 266 billion or 245 per share in 2006 net income comparisons between 2007 and 2006 are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results see notes 3 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

latestage pipeline developments and business development activity 

 

our longterm success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies we have achieved a number of successes with latestage pipeline developments and recent business development transactions within the past year including

legal regulatory and other matters 

 

in october the united states supreme court denied the petitions for certiorari that were filed by teva pharmaceuticals and dr reddy’s laboratories bringing to an end the two companies’ challenges to the validity of lilly’s us zyprexa patent 

 

in june we received notice of two court rulings by the canadian federal court and the german patent court that permit the entry of generic olanzapine zyprexa by competitors into the canadian and german markets generic olanzapine is now available for sale by competitors in canada and germany 

 

we have reached agreements with claimants’ attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately 31200 claims against us relating to the medication approximately 1235 claims remain as a result of our product liability exposures since the beginning of 2005 we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of 161 billion for zyprexa product liability matters 

  in march 2004 we were notified by the us attorney’s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa that it had commenced an investigation relating to our us marketing and promotional practices for zyprexa prozac ®  and prozac weekly tm  in november 2007 we received a grand jury subpoena from the edpa requesting documents related to zyprexa 

 

in the united states the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma continues to effectively provide a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program known as medicare part d various measures have been discussed andor passed in both the us house of representatives and us senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow or require the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers additionally various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to medicaid patients we expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to continue 

 

in 2007 the centers for medicare and medicaid services released a final rule seeking to implement sections of the deficit reduction act of 2005 this rule relates to the medicaid program and among other things sets out a methodology for the calculation and use of average manufacturer price and best price for pharmaceuticals we have implemented the final rule which has the effect of reducing net selling prices for medicaid sales however we do not expect the impact to be material to our consolidated results of operations liquidity or financial position 

 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

 

operating results — 2007 

 

sales 

 

our worldwide sales for 2007 increased 19 percent to 1863 billion driven primarily by the inclusion of cialis since our january 29 2007 acquisition of icos and sales growth of cymbalta zyprexa alimta gemzar ®  and humalog ®  worldwide sales volume increased 12 percent while selling prices and foreign exchange rates each increased sales by 3 percent numbers do not add due to rounding sales in the us increased 18 percent to 1015 billion driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta zyprexa alimta and byetta and the inclusion of cialis sales outside the us increased 20 percent to 849 billion driven primarily by the inclusion of cialis and sales growth of zyprexa alimta gemzar and cymbalta

total worldwide sales of cialis a treatment for erectile dysfunction were 122 billion and 9710 million during 2007 and 2006 respectively this includes 727 million of sales in the lilly icos jointventure territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of icos worldwide sales grew 25 percent in 2007 us sales increased 20 percent in 2007 driven by increased demand and higher prices sales outside the us increased 28 percent in 2007 driven by increased demand the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices prior to the icos acquisition cialis sales in our territories were reported in net sales while our 50 percent share of the jointventure net income was reported in other income — net all sales of cialis subsequent to the icos acquisition are reported in our net sales 

 

sales of evista a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer increased 6 percent in the us driven by higher prices sales outside the us increased 1 percent driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices and lower demand 

 

sales of humulin an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes decreased 1 percent in the us driven by lower demand partially offset by higher prices sales outside the us increased 11 percent driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower prices 

 

sales of alimta a secondline treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer and in combination with another agent for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma increased 28 percent in the us driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices sales outside the us increased 55 percent driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

 

sales of forteo an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture increased 19 percent in the us driven by higher net selling prices us sales growth benefited from access to medical coverage through the medicare part d program and decreased utilization of our us patient assistance program and to a lesser extent increased demand sales outside the us increased 21 percent driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

  sales of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder in children adolescents and adults decreased 9 percent in the us as a result of decreased demand sales outside the us increased 50 percent driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

 

our revenues from actos an oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes a portion of which represent revenues from a copromotion agreement in the us with takeda pharmaceuticals north america takeda decreased 46 percent in the us actos is manufactured by takeda chemical industries ltd and sold in the us by takeda our us marketing rights with respect to actos expired in september 2006 however we continue to receive royalties from takeda through september 2009 at rates that decline each year our arrangement outside the us continues sales outside the us increased 30 percent driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

 

worldwide sales of byetta an injectable product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes which we market with amylin pharmaceuticals amylin increased 51 percent to 6502 million during 2007 we report as revenue our 50 percent share of byetta’s gross margin in the us 100 percent of byetta sales outside the us and our sales of byetta pen delivery devices to amylin our revenues increased 51 percent to 3307 million in 2007 

 

animal health product sales in the us increased 18 percent driven by increased demand the acquisition of ivy animal health and new companionanimal product launches sales outside the us increased 10 percent driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand 

 

 

gross margin costs and expenses 

 

the 2007 gross margin decreased to 772 percent of sales compared with 774 percent for 2006 this decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the icos acquisition the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales offset partially by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales 

 

operating expenses the aggregate of research and development and marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 19 percent in 2007 investment in research and development increased 11 percent to 349 billion in addition to the acquisition of icos this increase was due to increases in discovery research and latestage clinical trial costs we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing 

  approximately 19 percent of our sales into research and development during 2007 marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 25 percent in 2007 to 610 billion this increase was largely due to the impact of the icos acquisition as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care products and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

 

acquired iprd charges were 7456 million in 2007 and related to the acquisitions of icos hypnion and ivy as well as our licensing arrangements with osi macrogenics and glenmark we incurred asset impairments restructuring and other special charges of 3025 million in 2007 as compared to 9452 million in 2006 see notes 3 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

other income — net decreased 1158 million to 1220 million this line item consists of interest expense interest income the aftertax operating results of the lilly icos joint venture and all other miscellaneous income and expense items 

 

  

we incurred tax expense of 9238 million in 2007 resulting in an effective tax rate of 238 percent compared with 221 percent for 2006 the effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were affected primarily by the nondeductible icos and hypnion iprd charges of 5946 million in 2007 and the product liability charges of 4949 million in 2006 the tax effect of the product liability charge was less than our effective tax rate as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

  operating results — 2006 

 

financial results 

 

we achieved worldwide sales growth of 7 percent primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products we increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care products and continued our commitment to research and development investing approximately 20 percent of our sales during 2006 our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the lilly icos joint venture as well as costcontainment and productivity initiatives net income was 266 billion or 245 per share in 2006 as compared with 198 billion or 181 per share in 2005 representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 35 percent certain items reflected in our operating results for 2006 and 2005 should be considered in comparing the two years the significant items for 2006 are summarized in the executive overview the 2005 items are summarized as follows see notes 2 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

  

sales 

 

our worldwide sales for 2006 increased 7 percent to 1569 billion driven primarily by sales growth of cymbalta forteo byetta zyprexa and alimta worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent and selling prices increased sales by 4 percent foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth sales in the us increased 10 percent to 860 billion driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta diabetes care products forteo and zyprexa us growth comparisons benefited from an estimated 170 million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in 2005 as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in the first quarter of 2005 additionally we experienced a sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain lowincome patients from medicaid to medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our lillyanswers ® program following the implementation of mma in 2006 this contributed part of the increases in us net effective sales prices of 9 percent sales outside the us increased 4 percent to 709 billion driven by growth of cymbalta alimta and zyprexa 

 

zyprexa sales in the us increased 4 percent in 2006 driven by higher prices offset in part by lower demand the increase in net selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain lowincome patients from medicaid to medicare sales outside the us increased 4 percent driven primarily by increased demand offset in part by declining prices 

 

diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of 296 billion in 2006 an increase of 6 percent diabetes care revenues in the us increased 8 percent to 173 billion diabetes care revenues outside the us increased 2 percent to 123 billion results from our primary diabetes care products are as follows 

 

 25 

   

  

sales of gemzar increased 4 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in us wholesaler inventory levels in 2005 gemzar sales increased 7 percent outside the us driven by strong volume 

 

sales of cymbalta increased 82 percent in the us due to strong demand sales of cymbalta outside the us reflect international launches 

 

sales of evista increased 2 percent in the us due to higher prices offset partially by a decline in demand outside the us sales of evista decreased 1 percent driven by lower prices offset by an increase in demand 

 

the following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2006 compared with 2005 

 

 

 

 

nm — not meaningful 

 

  

sales of alimta increased 18 percent and 57 percent in the us and outside the us respectively due primarily to increased demand 

 

sales of forteo increased 57 percent in the us in addition to increased demand us sales significantly benefited from patients’ access to medical coverage through the medicare part d program and from decreased utilization of our us patient assistance program lillyanswers sales outside the us increased 43 percent reflecting strong demand 

  sales of strattera increased 2 percent in the us due to higher prices as well as the reductions in us wholesaler inventory levels in 2005 offset by a decline in demand sales outside the us increased 31 percent due primarily to increased demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign exchange rates offset partially by lower prices 

 

total product sales of cialis increased 38 percent in the us and 24 percent outside the us worldwide cialis sales growth reflects the impact of market share gains market growth and price increases during 2006 

 

animal health product sales in the us increased 10 percent due primarily to increased demand led by rumensin ® and tylan ®  sales outside the us decreased 5 percent driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of surmax ® as a result of the european union’s growth promotion use ban on the product effective january 1 2006 

 

gross margin costs and expenses 

 

the 2006 gross margin increased to 774 percent of sales compared with 763 percent for 2005 this increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses 

 

operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2006 investment in research and development increased 3 percent to 313 billion primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 20 percent of our sales into research and development during 2006 marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2006 to 489 billion this increase was largely attributable to increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise and an increase in litigationrelated costs 

 

other income — net decreased 764 million to 2378 million 

 

  

we incurred tax expense of 7553 million in 2006 resulting in an effective tax rate of 221 percent compared with 263 percent for 2005 the effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were affected primarily by the product liability charges of 4949 million and 107 billion respectively the tax benefit associated with these charges was less than our effective tax rate as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2007 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 483 billion compared with 389 billion at december 31 2006 cash flow from operations in 2007 of 515 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 145 billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of 267 billion dividends paid of 185 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 108 billion 

 

capital expenditures of 108 billion during 2007 were consistent with 2006 due primarily to the management of capital spending we expect nearterm capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2007 levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives continue to upgrade our 

  manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems and invest in the longterm growth of our diabetes care products 

 

 

total debt as of december 31 2007 increased 129 billion to 501 billion reflecting the 250 billion of debt we issued in 2007 to finance our acquisition of icos offset by longterm debt repayment of 106 billion our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s remain at aa and aa3 respectively 

 

dividends of 170 per share were paid in 2007 an increase of 6 percent from 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2007 effective for the firstquarter dividend in 2008 the quarterly dividend was increased to 47 per share a 106 percent increase resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2008 of 188 per share the year 2007 was the 123rd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 40th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 

 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including debt service capital expenditures costs associated with product liability litigation dividends and taxes in 2008 we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund shortterm borrowings if necessary we currently have 124 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion of which backs our commercial paper program our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in the financial expectations for 2008 section may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

 

  

 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2007 and 2006 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen and the british pound against the euro we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2007 and 2006 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

  offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire and partner assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

 

individually these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur as the failure rate for products in development is very high in addition these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 30 

   

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2007 the amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

 

revenue recognition and sales rebate and discount accruals 

 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership for more than 90 percent of our sales this is at the time products are shipped to the customer typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain the remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations an unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the us could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 

 

as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early 2005 reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera prozac and gemzar that reduced our 2005 sales by approximately 170 million the modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our us wholesalers wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns which have been approximately 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebatediscount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales sales rebatesdiscounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longtermcare hospital patient assistance programs and various other government programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebatediscount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebatediscount contracts 

 

the largest of our sales rebatediscount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid 

  recipients and our product pricing and current rebatediscount contracts although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later due to the time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit we adjust our rebate reserves 

 

we believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by 6421 million 5717 million and 6371 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively a 5 percent change in the medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2007 would lead to an approximate 32 million effect on our income before income taxes as of december 31 2007 our medicaid and medicare rebate liability was 3088 million 

 

approximately 75 percent and 85 percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial position of the insurers and the possibility of and the length of time for collection 

 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

  pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

 

periodically we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans in evaluating these assumptions we consider many factors including an evaluation of the discount rates expected return on plan assets and the healthcarecost trend rates of other companies our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we use an actuarially determined companyspecific yield curve to determine the discount rate in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

 

we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2007 annual expense would increase by approximately 28 million a onepercentagepoint decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2007 service cost and interest cost by approximately 23 million if the 2007 discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by approximately 32 million if the 2007 expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by approximately 14 million if our assumption regarding the 2007 expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately 31 million the us plans represent approximately 80 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 83 percent of total plan assets at december 31 2007 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted the estimated future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of 

  an examination we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

 

we believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately 78 million and 26 million respectively 

 

financial expectations for 2008 

 

for the full year of 2008 we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 380 to 395 this guidance includes the anticipated acquired inprocess research and development charges of 05 related to the bioms inlicensing agreement we expect sales to grow in the midto highsingle digits driven primarily by increased volume and strong sales growth for cymbalta cialis byetta alimta and humalog we expect modest improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales driven primarily by manufacturing expenses growing more slowly than sales in addition we expect operating expenses to grow more slowly than sales in 2008 with growth in the midsingle digits marketing selling and administrative expenses are expected to grow in the lowsingle digits driven by investments in prasugrel cymbalta evista for invasive breast cancer risk reduction humalog and byetta offset by decreases in other areas research and development expenses are expected to grow in the highsingle to lowdouble digits other income — net is expected to contribute less than 100 million the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 percent we expect capital expenditures of approximately 11 billion 

 

actual results could differ materially and will depend on among other things the continuing growth of our currently marketed products developments with competitive products the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches asset impairments restructurings and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired inprocess research and development charges foreign exchange rates changes in effective tax rates wholesaler inventory changes other regulatory developments litigation and government investigations and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing importation and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals we undertake no duty to update these forwardlooking statements 

 

legal and regulatory matters 

 

we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations the most significant of these are described below while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters we believe that except as specifically noted below the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 

 

patent litigation 

 

we are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 

 

 34 

    

  

we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us 

 

 35 

    

  

we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a countrybycountry basis we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation the availability of generic olanzapine in canada and germany will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

 

in june 2002 ariad pharmaceuticals inc the massachusetts institute of technology the whitehead institute for biomedical research and the president and fellows of harvard college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts sued us alleging that sales of two of our products xigris ® and evista were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products on may 4 2006 a jury in boston issued an initial decision in the case that xigris and evista sales infringe the patent the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately 65 million in damages calculated by applying a 23 percent royalty to all us sales of xigris and evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial in addition a separate bench trial with the us district court of massachusetts was held in august 2006 on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes in june 2005 the united states patent and trademark office uspto commenced a reexamination of the patent and in august 2007 took the position that the ariad claims at issue are unpatentable a position that ariad continues to contest in september 2007 the court entered a final judgment indicating that ariad’s claims are patentable valid and enforceable and finding damages in the amount of 65 million plus a 23 percent royalty on net us sales of xigris and evista since the time of the jury decision however the court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted we plan to appeal this judgment we believe that these allegations are without legal merit that we will ultimately prevail on these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 

 

government investigations and related litigation 

 

in march 2004 the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors with respect to zyprexa prozac and prozac weekly in november 2007 we received a grand jury subpoena from the edpa for a broad range of documents related to zyprexa a number of state medicaid fraud control units are coordinating with the edpa in its investigation of any medicaidrelated claims relating to our marketing and promotion of zyprexa in october 2005 the edpa advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering axid ®  evista humalog humulin prozac and zyprexa the inquiry includes a review of our medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements 

 

in june 2005 we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general medicaid fraud control unit of the state of florida seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 

  in september 2006 we received a subpoena from the california attorney general’s office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain zyprexa’s status on california’s formulary marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa and remuneration of health care providers 

 

in february 2007 we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general of the state of illinois seeking production of documents and information relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors with respect to zyprexa 

 

beginning in august 2006 we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general we are aware that approximately 30 states are participating in this joint effort and it is possible that additional states will join the investigation these attorneys general are seeking a broad range of zyprexa documents including documents relating to sales marketing and promotional practices and remuneration of health care providers in addition we have been named as a defendant in a private suit in california state court which was removed to federal court alleging violations of the california false claims act with respect to certain zyprexa marketing and promotional practices this suit was brought by an individual on behalf of the government under the qui tam provision of the california false claims act 

 

we are cooperating in each of these investigations including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations it is possible that other lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies we cannot determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome it is possible however that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position we have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliancerelated activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices physician communications remuneration of health care professionals managed care arrangements and medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations 

 

product liability and related litigation 

 

we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the united states and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the “claims” allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 1596 

 

since june 2005 we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims the agreements cover a total of approximately 31200 claimants including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims the two primary settlements were as follows 

 

  

the 2005 settlement totaling 7000 million was paid during 2005 the january 2007 settlements were paid during 2007 

  we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 325 lawsuits in the us covering approximately 1235 plaintiffs trial dates have been set for june 23 2008 in the eastern district of new york for several of the us plaintiffs 

 

in early 2005 we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec and a second has been certified in ontario and includes all canadian residents except for residents of quebec and british columbia the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the us 

 

we have insurance coverage for a portion of our zyprexa product liability claims exposure the thirdparty insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies the dispute was the subject of litigation in the federal court in indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in bermuda against other carriers in the second half of 2007 we reached settlements resolving the vast majority of the disputed insurance claims and a portion of the insurance proceeds were paid to us prior to the end of 2007 

 

since the beginning of 2005 we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of 161 billion for zyprexa product liability matters the net charges which take into account our actual and expected insurance recoveries covered the following 

 

  

in december 2004 we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york in these actions the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drugbenefit programs as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexarelated illnesses we have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of alaska mississippi montana new mexico pennsylvania south carolina utah and west virginia in the courts of the respective states the mississippi montana new mexico and west virginia cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york the alaska case is scheduled for trial beginning march 3 2008 

 

in 2005 two lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes the federal civil rico statute and common law theories seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa treble damages punitive damages and attorneys’ fees two additional lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york in 2006 on similar grounds in 2007 the pennsylvania employees trust fund brought claims in state court in pennsylvania as insurer of pennsylvania state employees who were prescribed zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the new york cases as with the product liability suits these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 

 

we cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

in addition we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal the majority of these claims are covered by insurance subject to deductibles and coverage limits 

  because of the nature of pharmaceutical products it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future in the past few years we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition as noted above there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims

eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” which may be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment — pharmaceutical products we also have an animal health business segment whose operations are not material to our financial statements we manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the united states puerto rico and 25 other countries our products are sold in approximately 140 countries 

 

most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products we direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat human diseases we also conduct research to find products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production 

 

products 

 

our principal products are 

 

neuroscience products  our largestselling product group including 

 

  

endocrine products including

oncology products  including 

 

  

animal health products  including

marketing 

 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

 

pharmaceuticals – united states 

 

in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors with some sales directly to pharmacies our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals public and private payers and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country three wholesale distributors in the united states – amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation – each accounted for between 14 and 21 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2006 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material 

 

we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians wholesalers hospitals managedcare organizations retail pharmacists and other health care 

  professionals we advertise in medical and drug journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are assigned to therapeutic areas such as neuroscience diabetes osteoporosis critical care and oncology 

 

large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups government agencies and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we have created special business groups to service managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospital contract administrators and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with a number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more lilly products 

 

pharmaceuticals – outside the united states 

 

outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales organizations in some countries however we market our products through independent distributors 

 

pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

 

several of our significant products are marketed in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 

 

  

we have also entered into licensing arrangements under which we have granted exclusive marketing rights to other companies in specified countries for certain older products manufactured by us such as ceclor and vancocin 

 

animal health products 

 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states to market animal health products elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors 

 

competition 

 

our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries 

   

important competitive factors include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service and research and development of new products and processes if competitors introduce new products delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded product loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or “knockoff” versions of our products to successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care 

 

we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative costeffective products that serve unmet medical needs together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our discovery development manufacturing marketing and support operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors 

 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

 

overview 

 

intellectual property protection is in the aggregate material to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents both in the united states and in other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products in addition from time to time competitors or other third parties assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them while there can be no assurance we do not believe that any such claims will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position 

 

outside the united states the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners however in many countries this agreement will not become fully effective for many years it is still too soon to assess when and how much if at all we will benefit commercially from these changes 

 

when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or databased exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

 

our intellectual property portfolio 

 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses – particularly those products discussed below – to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

   

we have the following us patent protection for major marketed products 

 

  

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

 

patent challenges under the hatchwaxman act 

 

the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws in the united states before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the food and drug administration fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals other than biological products without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug – not safety and efficacy 

 

absent a successful patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents if one or more of the ndalisted patents are successfully 

  challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

 

in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on zyprexa evista and gemzar for more information on these see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis – legal and regulatory matters” 

 

government regulation 

 

regulation of our operations 

 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery development and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment 

 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products 

 

outside the united states our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency emea in the european union and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations in recent years we have made and we continue to make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing product and process development and quality operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks false claims unfair trade practices and consumer protection these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years both the fda and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies over this period several cases brought by these agencies against lilly and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements several pharmaceutical companies including lilly are currently subject to proceedings by one or more of these agencies regarding marketing and promotional practices see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis – legal and regulatory matters” for information about currently pending marketing and promotional practices investigations in which we are involved it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could 

  include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in such an action could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 

 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

 

in the us implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma providing a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program took effect january 1 2006 see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis – executive overview – legal and governmental matters” for a discussion of the impact of mma and other federal and state healthcare cost containment measures 

 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will continue to increase 

 

research and development 

 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2006 we employed approximately 8300 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 269 billion in 2004 303 billion in 2005 and 313 billion in 2006 

 

our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes obesity and musculoskeletal disorders cancer and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving recombinant dna therapeutic proteins and antibodies as well as genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function biomarkers and targeted therapeutics in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients we also conduct research in animal health including animal nutrition and physiology control of parasites and veterinary medicine 

 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

   

drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval even after approval and launch of a product we expend considerable resources on postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all stages of development among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for diabetes and its complications osteoporosis cancer and acute coronary syndromes further we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including compounds targeting cancers thrombotic disorders diabetes obesity alzheimer’s disease schizophrenia depression pain and migraine attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd alcoholism sleep disorders and rheumatoid arthritis we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our currently marketed products such as zyprexa cymbalta gemzar alimta cialis evista forteo and byetta 

 

raw materials and product supply 

 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition four of our significant products are manufactured by others actos by takeda reopro by centocor xigris by lonza biologics bulk product and dsm nv finished product and byetta by thirdparty suppliers to amylin if we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

 

our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in indiana as well as locations in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world 

 

we seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

 

quality assurance 

 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

 

control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers

other patent litigation 

 

during 2005 two generic pharmaceutical manufacturers apotex inc apotex and novopharm ltd novopharm a whollyowned subsidiary of teva challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and methodofuse patent expiring in 2011 in canada the generic companies allege that our patent is invalid obtained by fraud or irrelevant we currently anticipate a decision from the canadian federal patent court by april 2007 in the apotex case and by september 2007 in the novopharm case in may 2004 egisgyogyszergyar a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and methodofuse patents expiring in 2011 in germany we currently anticipate a decision from the german patent court in the second or third quarter of 2007 we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of other countries as well including several eastern european countries we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation 

 

in october 2002 pfizer inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court in delaware against us lilly icos llc and icos corporation alleging that the proposed marketing of cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe its newly issued methodofuse patent in september 2003 the us patent and trademark office ordered that pfizer’s patent be reexamined and in march 2006 the pto finally rejected the broad methodofuse claim pfizer is appealing that decision meanwhile the delaware suit has been stayed pending the final outcome of the reexamination in the uk european union and australia this same patent has been held finally invalid and pfizer has revoked this patent in new zealand and south africa in brazil pfizer is appealing a lower court decision holding this patent invalid in mexico and canada infringement and nullification actions are still pending we intend to vigorously defend this litigation and expect to prevail however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation 

 

other product liability litigation 

 

we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability lawsuits in the united states involving primarily zyprexa diethylstilbestrol “des” and thimerosal 

   

in approximately 85 us actions involving approximately 140 claimants plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed des during pregnancy 

 

we have been named as a defendant in approximately 355 actions in the us involving approximately 930 claimants brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us beginning in the 1930s we purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to thimerosal in the 1920s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the majority of the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies 

 

other marketing practices investigations 

 

in 2002 2003 and 2004 we received grand jury subpoenas from the office of consumer litigation department of justice related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to evista in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a provision for 360 million in connection with the matter in december 2005 we reached a settlement of the matter with the government which was subsequently approved by the us district court for the southern district of indiana in february 2006 as part of the settlement we agreed to plead guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act the plea is for the offlabel promotion of evista during 1998 the government did not charge the company with any unlawful intent nor do we acknowledge any such intent in connection with the overall settlement we paid a total of 360 million in addition as part of the settlement a civil consent decree requires us to continue to have a compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations related to evista for five years 

 

in august 2003 we received notice that the staff of the sec is conducting an investigation into the compliance by polish subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies including lilly with the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the staff has issued subpoenas to us requesting production of documents related to the investigation we are cooperating with the sec in responding to the investigation 

 

other matters 

 

in october 2005 we received a subpoena from the us attorney’s office for the district of massachusetts for the production of documents relating to our business relationship with a longterm care pharmacy organization concerning actos humalog humulin and zyprexa we are cooperating in responding to the subpoena 

 

between 2003 and 2005 various counties in new york sued us and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers claiming in general that as a result of alleged improprieties by the manufacturers in the calculation and reporting of average wholesale prices for purposes of medicaid reimbursement the counties overpaid their portion of the cost of pharmaceuticals the suits seek monetary and other relief including civil penalties and treble damages a similar suit was filed against us and many other manufacturers by the state of mississippi the suits have been transferred to the us district court for the district of massachusetts for pretrial proceedings and are in the earliest stages 

   

during 2004 we along with several other pharmaceutical companies were named in one consolidated case in minnesota federal court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the conduct of pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial importation of prescription drugs from outside the united states violated antitrust laws and one case in california state court brought by several pharmacies in which plaintiffs’ claims are less specifically stated but are substantially similar to the claims asserted in minnesota both cases seek restitution for alleged overpayments for pharmaceuticals and an injunction against the allegedly violative conduct the federal district court in the minnesota case has dismissed the federal claims ruling that the state claims must be brought in separate state court actions the eighth circuit court of appeals has affirmed the district court’s decision in the california case summary judgment has been granted to lilly and the other defendants the plaintiffs have appealed that decision 

 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund we have been designated as one of several potentially responsible parties with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites under superfund each responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the cleanup

executive overview 

 

this section provides an overview of our financial results significant business development recent product and latestage pipeline developments and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 

 

financial results 

 

we achieved worldwide sales growth of 7 percent primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products we increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products primarily cymbalta ® and diabetes care products and continued our commitment to research and development investing approximately 20 percent of our sales during 2006 our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the lilly icos joint venture as well as costcontainment and productivity initiatives net income was 266 billion or 245 per share in 2006 as compared with 198 billion or 181 per share in 2005 representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 35 percent net income comparisons between 2006 and 2005 are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results see notes 2 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

 

  

 

  

  

 

business development and recent product and latestage pipeline developments 

 

our longterm success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies we have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and latestage pipeline developments including 

 

  

  

 

  

legal and governmental matters 

 

in december 2006 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed a district court ruling upholding the validity of our zyprexa patent we are very confident we will maintain our us patent protection on zyprexa until 2011 

 

we have reached agreements with claimants’ attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately 28500 claims against us relating to the medication approximately 1300 claims remain as a result of our product liability exposures the substantial majority of which were related to 

  zyprexa we recorded net pretax charges of 107 billion in the second quarter of 2005 and 4949 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 

 

in march 2004 we were notified by the us attorney’s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania that it had commenced a civil investigation relating to our us marketing and promotional practices 

 

in the united states implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma which provides a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program took effect january 1 2006 in 2006 we experienced a onetime sales benefit as a result of mma however in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures while the mma prohibits the secretary of health and human services hhs from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers legislation was passed in early 2007 by the us house of representatives that would require hhs to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers this legislation will be considered by the us senate mma retains the authority of the secretary of hhs to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs legislation to allow for broadscale importation has been presented to both the house of representatives and the senate the proposed legislation could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the us if adopted such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our us sales current importation language allows for medication to be carried in person from canada to the us and does not authorize mail or internet importation further the language disallows certain medications including injectibles we believe the expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the mma has further alleviated the perceived need for a federal importation scheme however notwithstanding the federal law that continues to prohibit all but the very narrow drug importation detailed above several states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens usually involving a website that links patients to selected canadian pharmacies 

 

the successful implementation of the mma may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level a majority of states have implemented supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their medicaid programs and these programs are expected to continue in the postmma environment moreover under the 2005 federal deficit reduction act states will have greater flexibility to impose new costsharing requirements on medicaid beneficiaries for nonpreferred prescription drugs that will result in certain beneficiaries bearing more of the cost several states also are attempting to extend discounted medicaid prices to nonmedicaid patients as a result we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue 

 

as it relates to the medicare program lilly has implemented the lillymedicareanswers program lilly medicareanswers is a new patient assistance program that provides certain eligible medicare part d enrolled patients access to a one month’ssupply of select medications for a 25 administrative fee per prescription medications available via the program include zyprexa forteo ®  and humatrope ®  

 

international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

 

operating results — 2006 

 

sales 

 

our worldwide sales for 2006 increased 7 percent to 1569 billion driven primarily by sales growth of cymbalta forteo byetta zyprexa and alimta ®  worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent and selling prices increased sales by 4 percent foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth sales in the us increased 10 percent to 860 billion driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta diabetes care products forteo and zyprexa us growth comparisons benefited from an estimated 170 million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in 2005 as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in the first quarter of 2005 additionally we experienced a onetime sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain lowincome patients from medicaid to medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our lillyanswers program following the implementation 

  of mma in 2006 this contributed part of the increases in us net effective sales prices of 9 percent sales outside the us increased 4 percent to 709 billion driven by growth of cymbalta alimta and zyprexa 

 

zyprexa our topselling product is a treatment for schizophrenia bipolar mania and bipolar maintenance zyprexa sales in the us increased 4 percent in 2006 driven by higher prices offset in part by lower demand the increase in net effective selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain lowincome patients from medicaid to medicare sales outside the us increased 4 percent driven primarily by increased demand offset in part by declining prices 

 

the following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2006 compared with 2005

sales of gemzar a product approved to fight various cancers increased 4 percent in the us due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in us wholesaler inventory levels in 2005 gemzar sales increased 7 percent outside the us driven by strong volume 

 

sales of cymbalta a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain increased 82 percent in the us due to strong demand sales of cymbalta outside the us reflect international launches worldwide sales exceeded 1 billion in 2006 the product’s second full year on the market

sales of alimta a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma and secondline treatment for nonsmallcell lung cancer nsclc increased 18 percent and 57 percent in the us and outside the us respectively due primarily to increased demand 

 

sales of forteo a treatment for severe osteoporosis increased 57 percent in the us in addition to increased demand us sales significantly benefited from patients’ access to medical coverage through the medicare part d program and from decreased utilization of our us patient assistance program lillyanswers sales outside the us increased 43 percent reflecting a strong demand 

 

sales of strattera a treatment for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder in children adolescents and adults increased 2 percent in the us due to higher prices as well as the reductions in us wholesaler inventory levels in 2005 offset by a decline in demand sales outside the us increased 31 percent due primarily to increased demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign exchange rates offset partially by lower prices 

 

total product sales of cialis an erectile dysfunction treatment increased 38 percent in the us and 24 percent outside the us worldwide cialis sales growth reflects the impact of market share gains market growth and price increases during 2006 cialis sales in our territories are reported in net sales while our 50 percent share of the jointventure net income is reported in other income — net all sales of cialis subsequent to the icos acquisition in 2007 will be included in our revenue 

 

animal health product sales in the us increased 10 percent due primarily to increased demand led by rumensin ® and tylan ®  sales outside the us decreased 5 percent driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of surmax ® as a result of the european union’s growth promotion use ban on the product effective january 1 2006 

 

 

gross margin costs and expenses 

 

the 2006 gross margin increased to 774 percent of sales compared with 763 percent for 2005 this increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses 

   

operating expenses the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses increased 7 percent in 2006 investment in research and development increased 3 percent to 313 billion primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 20 percent of our sales into research and development during 2006 marketing and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2006 to 489 billion this increase was largely attributable to increased marketing expenses in support of key products primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise and an increase in litigationrelated costs 

 

other income — net decreased 764 million to 2378 million and consists of interest expense interest income the aftertax operating results of the lilly icos joint venture and all other miscellaneous income and expense items 

 

  

we incurred tax expense of 7553 million in 2006 resulting in an effective tax rate of 221 percent compared with 263 percent for 2005 the effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were affected primarily by the product liability charges of 4949 million and 107 billion respectively the tax expense of these charges was less than our effective tax rate as the tax expense was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

  operating results — 2005 

 

financial results 

 

we achieved worldwide sales growth of 6 percent due in part to the launch in 2004 of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets in addition we launched one new product in the us and several new products new indications or new formulations in key markets in 2005 we continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales despite product launch expenditures our costcontainment and productivity measures contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales during 2005 we began to expense stock options which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses we also benefited from an increase in other income — net due primarily to increased profitability of the lilly icos joint venture and a decrease in the tax rate in 2005 net income was 198 billion or 181 per share in 2005 as compared with 181 billion or 166 per share in 2004 representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 9 percent certain items reflected in our operating results for 2005 and 2004 should be considered in comparing the two years the significant items for 2005 are summarized in the executive overview the 2004 items are summarized as follows see notes 1 3 4 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

  

sales 

 

our worldwide sales for 2005 increased 6 percent to 1465 billion driven primarily by sales growth of cymbalta alimta forteo and gemzar as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early 2005 reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera prozac ®  and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately 170 million sales growth in 2005 was also affected by decreased us demand for zyprexa strattera and prozac despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand sales in the us increased 2 percent to 780 billion driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta and alimta sales outside the us increased 11 percent to 685 billion driven by growth of zyprexa alimta and gemzar worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 3 percent with global selling prices contributing 1 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 1 percent numbers do not add due to rounding 

  the following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2005 compared with 2004 

 

 

nm — not meaningful 

  

zyprexa sales in the us decreased 16 percent in 2005 resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures sales outside the us in 2005 increased 9 percent driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates excluding the impact of exchange rates sales of zyprexa outside the us increased by 6 percent 

 

diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of 280 billion in 2005 an increase of 7 percent diabetes care revenues in the us increased 7 percent to 159 billion primarily driven by higher prices offset partially by a decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of insulins diabetes care revenues outside the us increased 8 percent to 120 billion humalog sales increased 8 percent in the us and 10 percent outside the us humulin sales in the us decreased 3 percent while humulin sales outside the us increased 3 percent actos revenues increased 9 percent in 2005 sales of byetta were 746 million following its june 2005 launch our reported net sales of byetta totaled 396 million in 2005 

 

sales of gemzar increased 4 percent in the us in 2005 and were negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers gemzar sales increased 15 percent outside the us driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications 

 

sales of evista decreased 2 percent in the us due to declines in us underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and to reductions in wholesaler inventory levels this decline was partially 

  offset by price increases outside the us sales of evista increased 11 percent driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in japan 

 

cymbalta was launched in the us in late august 2004 for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in september 2004 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain cymbalta launches began in europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of 2005 cymbalta generated 6797 million in sales in 2005 

 

sales of strattera declined 24 percent in the us in 2005 due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand sales outside the us were 534 million in 2005 compared with 103 million in 2004 primarily reflecting launches in australia canada germany mexico and spain 

 

alimta was launched in the us in february 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in august for secondline treatment of nonsmallcell lung cancer nsclc alimta was launched in several european countries in the second half of 2004 and throughout 2005 alimta generated sales of 4632 million in 2005 

 

forteo increased 34 percent in the us in 2005 driven by strong growth in underlying demand sales growth was offset in part by wholesaler destocking in the first half of 2005 related to our revised arrangements with us wholesalers 

 

cialis worldwide sales of 7466 million in 2005 reflected an increase of 35 percent compared to 2004 and comprises 1699 million of sales in our territories and 5767 million of sales in the jointventure territories within the jointventure territories us sales of cialis were 2729 million for 2005 an increase of 32 percent despite wholesaler destocking in the first half of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers 

 

animal health product sales in the us increased 9 percent while sales outside the us increased 7 percent led by rumensin and paylean ®  

 

gross margin costs and expenses 

 

the 2005 gross margin decreased to 763 percent of sales compared with 767 percent for 2004 the decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses 

 

operating expenses increased 8 percent in 2005 investment in research and development increased 12 percent to 303 billion in 2005 due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005 decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 21 percent of our sales into research and development during 2005 marketing and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2005 to 450 billion due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005 and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses this comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the lilly foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004 research and development expenses would have increased by 8 percent and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for 2005 if 2004 had been restated as if stock options had been expensed 

 

other income — net increased 358 million in 2005 to 3142 million due to the following 

 

 26 

   

  

the effective tax rate for 2005 was 263 percent compared with 385 percent for 2004 the effective tax rate for 2005 was affected by the product liability charge of 107 billion the tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge the effective tax rate for 2004 was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of 800 billion of earnings reinvested outside the us pursuant to the ajca and the charge for acquired iprd related to the ame acquisition which is not deductible for tax purposes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2006 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 389 billion compared with 504 billion at december 31 2005 strong cash flow from operations in 2006 of 398 billion was more than offset by repayments of longterm debt of 278 billion dividends paid of 174 billion and capital expenditures of 108 billion 

 

capital expenditures of 108 billion during 2006 were 2203 million less than in 2005 due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects we expect nearterm capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2006 levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives continue to upgrade our manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems and invest in the longterm growth of our diabetes care products 

 

total debt as of december 31 2006 was 371 billion reflecting a net repayment of 278 billion during 2006 in early 2007 we issued approximately 25 billion of debt to finance our acquisition of icos including the acquisition of icos stock and refinancing of icos debt our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s remain at aa and aa3 respectively 

 

dividends of 160 per share were paid in 2006 an increase of 5 percent from 2005 in the fourth quarter of 2006 effective for the firstquarter dividend in 2007 the quarterly dividend was increased to 425 per share a 6 percent increase resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2007 of 170 per share the year 2006 was the 122nd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 39th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 

 

  

 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including debt service capital expenditures costs associated with product liability litigation dividends and taxes in 2007 we believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of shortterm borrowings if necessary we currently have 121 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 120 billion of which backs our commercial paper program excluding the longterm debt issued for the icos acquisition we plan to use available cash to repay approximately 1 billion of debt outside the us by the end of 2007 various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in the financial expectations for 2007 section may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

 

  

 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2006 and 2005 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2006 and 2005 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses 

  results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

 

our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

  

  

  

individually these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur as the failure rate for products in development is very high in addition these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2006 the amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues 

  expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

 

revenue recognition and sales rebate and discount accruals 

 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership for more than 90 percent of our sales this is at the time products are shipped to the customer typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain the remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

 

we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations an unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the us could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 

 

as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early 2005 reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera prozac and gemzar that reduced our 2005 sales by approximately 170 million the modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our us wholesalers wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns which have been approximately 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebatediscount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales sales rebatesdiscounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care medicare chargebacks longterm care hospital discount card programs and various other government programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebatediscount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebatediscount contracts we calculate these rebatesdiscounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups 

 

the largest of our sales rebatediscount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later due to the time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebatediscount contracts 

   

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit we adjust our rebate reserves 

 

we believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by 5717 million 6371 million and 6410 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively a 5 percent change in the medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2006 would lead to an approximate 29 million effect on our income before income taxes as of december 31 2006 our medicaid and medicare rebate liability was 2590 million 

 

approximately 85 percent and 90 percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial position of the insurers and the possibility of and the length of time for collection 

 

the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts 

  reported in addition to the analysis below see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

 

periodically we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans in evaluating these assumptions we consider many factors including an evaluation of the discount rates expected return on plan assets and the healthcarecost trend rates of other companies our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we use an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to determine the discount rate in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

 

we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2006 annual expense would increase by approximately 28 million a onepercentagepoint decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2006 service cost and interest cost by approximately 24 million if the discount rate for 2006 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by approximately 28 million if the expected return on plan assets for 2006 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes would change by approximately 14 million if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for 2006 were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately 29 million 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value if an impairment is identified a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value and the cost basis is adjusted the estimated future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections require management’s judgment actual results could vary from these estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated the tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances and additional uncertainties for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 

 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carry forwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future 

  income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances a 5 percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately 25 million 

 

financial expectations for 2007 

 

for the full year of 2007 we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 289 to 299 this guidance includes the estimated 10 per share dilutive impact of the icos acquisition related to the incremental interest expense on debt used to finance the acquisition the amortization of icos intangibles and other integration costs a disproportionate amount of this dilution is expected to be incurred in the first half of the year this guidance also includes the iprd charges related to the icos acquisition and the inlicensing of a diabetes compound from osi together estimated to be a total of 29 per share as discussed in note 3 as well as additional restructuring and other special charges as discussed in note 4 estimated to be 07 per share we expect sales to grow in the high single or low double digits impacted favorably by the inclusion of all cialis revenue subsequent to the acquisition gross margins as a percent of sales are expected to improve slightly compared with 2006 in addition we expect operating expenses to grow in the low double digits driven primarily by the inclusion of all cialis operating expenses subsequent to the acquisition and increased marketing and selling expenses in support of cymbalta zyprexa and the diabetes care franchise as well as ongoing investment in research and development that will continue to place lilly among the industry leaders in terms of research and development as a percent of sales we also expect other income — net to contribute less than 100 million a reduction from 2006 due to the removal of the lilly icos joint venture aftertax profit other income will primarily include net interest income and income from the partnering and outlicensing of molecules in terms of cash flow we expect a continuation of strong cash flow trends in 2007 with capital expenditures of approximately 11 billion 

 

actual results could differ materially and will depend on among other things the continuing growth of our currently marketed products developments with competitive products the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches asset impairments restructurings and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired inprocess research and development charges foreign exchange rates wholesaler inventory changes other regulatory developments litigation and government investigations and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing importation and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals we undertake no duty to update these forwardlooking statements 

 

legal and regulatory matters 

 

we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations the most significant of these are described below while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of these matters we believe that except as specifically noted below the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 

 

patent litigation 

 

we are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 

 

 34 

    

  

in june 2002 we were sued by ariad pharmaceuticals inc the massachusetts institute of technology the whitehead institute for biomedical research and the president and fellows of harvard college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that sales of two of our products xigris and evista were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products in june 2005 the united states patent and trademark office commenced a reexamination of the patent in order to consider certain issues raised by us relating to the validity of the patent on may 4 2006 a jury in boston issued an initial decision in the case that xigris and evista sales infringe the patent the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately 65 million in damages calculated by applying a 23 percent royalty to all us sales of xigris and evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial we are seeking to have the jury verdict overturned by the trial court judge and if unsuccessful will appeal the decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit in addition a separate bench trial with the us district court of massachusetts was held the week of august 7 2006 on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes no decision has been rendered we believe that these allegations are without legal merit that we will ultimately prevail on these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 

   

government investigations 

 

in march 2004 the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania advised us that it had commenced a civil investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors with respect to zyprexa prozac and prozac weekly tm  in october 2005 the us attorney’s office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering axid ®  evista humalog humulin prozac and zyprexa the inquiry includes a review of lilly’s medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements we are cooperating with the us attorney in these investigations including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations in june 2005 we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general medicaid fraud control unit of the state of florida seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa in september 2006 we received a subpoena from the california attorney general’s office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain zyprexa’s status on california’s formulary marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa and remuneration of health care providers beginning in august 2006 we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general we are aware that 26 states are participating in this joint effort and we anticipate that additional states will join the investigation these attorneys general are seeking a broad range of zyprexa documents including documents relating to sales marketing and promotional practices and remuneration of health care providers it is possible that other lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome it is possible however that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position we have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliancerelated activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices physician communications remuneration of health care professionals managed care arrangements and medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations 

 

product liability and related litigation 

 

we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the united states and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the “claims” allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 1596 

 

since june 2005 we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims the agreements cover a total of approximately 28500 claimants including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims the two primary settlements were as follows 

 

 36 

  the 2005 settlement totaling 7000 million was paid during 2005 the january 2007 settlements were recorded in other current liabilities in our december 31 2006 consolidated balance sheet and will be paid in the first quarter of 2007 

 

the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 340 lawsuits in the us covering approximately 900 claimants and an additional 400 claims of which we are aware in addition we have been served with a lawsuit seeking class certification in which the members of the purported class are seeking refunds and medical monitoring in early 2005 we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the us 

 

we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining cases we currently anticipate that trials in seven cases in the eastern district of new york will begin in the second quarter of 2007 

 

we have insurance coverage for a portion of our zyprexa product liability claims exposure the third party insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies the dispute is now the subject of litigation in the federal court in indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in bermuda against other carriers while we believe our position has merit there can be no assurance that we will prevail 

 

in addition we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal the majority of these claims are covered by insurance subject to deductibles and coverage limits 

 

in the second quarter of 2005 we recorded a net pretax charge of 107 billion for product liability matters the charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters the charge covered the following 

 

  

as a result of the january 2007 settlements discussed above we incurred a pretax charge of 4949 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 the charge covered the following 

 

  

in december 2004 we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york in these actions the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drugbenefit programs as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexarelated illnesses in 2006 we were served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of alaska west virginia new mexico and mississippi in the courts of the respective states 

 

in 2005 two lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and thirdparty payors excluding governmental entities which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes the federal civil rico statute and common law theories seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa treble damages 

  punitive damages and attorneys’ fees two additional lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york in 2006 on similar grounds as with the product liability suits these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 

 

we cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted in addition although we believe it is probable there can be no assurance that the january 2007 zyprexa product liability settlements described above will be concluded the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

 

because of the nature of pharmaceutical products it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future in the past few years we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market therefore for substantially all of our currently marketed products we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition as noted above there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims

 item 1   business tableend eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” which may be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment — pharmaceutical products we also have an animal health business segment whose operations are not material to our financial statements we manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the united states puerto rico and 26 other countries our products are sold in approximately 135 countries 

most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products we direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat human diseases we also conduct research to find products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production 

products 

our principal products are 

  neuroscience products our largestselling product group including 

   endocrine products including 

 1    oncology products including 

   animal health products including 

   cardiovascular agents including 

   antiinfectives including 

   other pharmaceutical products including 

 marketing 

we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs 

2 pharmaceuticals — united states 

in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals public and private payers and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country three wholesale distributors in the united states — amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation — each accounted for between 12 and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2005 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material 

we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians wholesalers hospitals managedcare organizations retail pharmacists and other health care professionals we advertise in medical and drug journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are assigned to product lines or practice areas such as primary care neuroscience acute care endocrinology and oncology 

large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups government agencies and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we have created special sales groups to service managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospital contract administrators and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with a number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more lilly products or other costsharing arrangements 

pharmaceuticals — outside the united states 

outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations in some countries however we market our products through independent distributors 

pharmaceutical marketing collaborations 

several of our significant products are marketed in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 

 3 

 we have also entered into licensing arrangements under which we have granted exclusive marketing rights to other companies in specified countries for certain older products manufactured by us such as permax sarafem vancocin the antiulcer agent axid ®  the analgesic darvon ®  and the antiinfectives ceclor keflex ®  keftab ®  and lorabid ®  

animal health products 

our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states to market animal health products elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors 

competition 

our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries 

important competitive factors include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service and research and development of new products and processes if competitors introduce new products delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded product loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or “knockoff” versions of our products to successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care 

we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative costeffective products that serve unmet medical needs together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our discovery development manufacturing marketing and support operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

overview 

intellectual property protection is in the aggregate material to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents both in the united states and in other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we 

4 are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products in addition from time to time competitors or other third parties assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them while there can be no assurance we do not believe that any such claims will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position 

outside the united states the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners however in many countries this agreement will not become fully effective for many years it is still too soon to assess when and how much if at all we will benefit commercially from these changes 

when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or databased exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 

our intellectual property portfolio 

we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses — particularly those products discussed below — to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 

united states compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective active ingredients in zyprexa 2011 and humalog 2013 the gemzar compound patent in the us expires in 2010 and a methodof use patent covering treatment of neoplasms with gemzar is in force until 2012 we have also received an additional six months of marketing exclusivity for gemzar from the fda under the terms of the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 as a result of our conducting clinical studies of gemzar in pediatric populations which should provide us exclusivity until 2013 we hold a number of us patents covering evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in the united states until 2014 for strattera a methodof use patent in the us for treating attention deficithyperactivity disorder should provide exclusivity until 2016 for cymbalta we expect the us compound patent will expire in 2013 we also have a formulation patent for cymbalta until 2014 we expect the us compound patent for alimta will expire in 2016 for cialis compound and methodof use patent protection exists in the us that should provide exclusivity until 2017 in the united states the actos compound patent extends beyond the duration of our copromotion agreement which is in force until september 2006 xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic product that is produced through recombinant dna technology xigris is not subject to the abbreviated new drug application process under the hatchwaxman law as described below in addition we hold patents on the dna materials certain uses manufacturing process and the glycoprotein itself we believe the intellectual property protection for xigris should provide us marketing exclusivity in the us until 2015 relevant patents covering byetta are exclusively licensed or owned by our partner 

5 amylin pharmaceuticals inc a method of use patent focused on the treatment of type 2 diabetes is expected to expire in the us in 2017 in addition a patent covering the byetta formulation will expire in the us in 2020 

worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 

patent challenges under the hatchwaxman act 

the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws in the united states before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the food and drug administration fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative medicines without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug — not safety and efficacy 

absent a successful patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents if one or more of the ndalisted patents are successfully challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 

in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on zyprexa evista and gemzar for more information on these see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis — legal and regulatory matters” 

government regulation 

regulation of our operations 

our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment 

6 of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products 

outside the united states our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements notably by the european medicines agency emea in the european union and the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw in japan regulatory requirements vary from country to country 

the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations in recent years we have made and we continue to make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing product and process development and quality operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production fines and penalties and delays in new product approvals 

the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks and false claims these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years both the fda and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies over this period several cases brought by these agencies against other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements several pharmaceutical companies including lilly are currently subject to proceedings by one or more of these agencies regarding marketing and promotional practices see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis — legal and regulatory matters” for information about currently pending marketing and promotional practices investigations in which we are involved it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in such an action could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 

in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution 

7 in the us implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma providing a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program took effect january 1 2006 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis — executive overview — legal and governmental matters” for a discussion of the anticipated impact of mma and other federal and state healthcare cost containment measures 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will continue 

research and development 

our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2005 we employed approximately 8400 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 235 billion in 2003 269 billion in 2004 and 303 billion in 2005 

our pharmaceutical research and development focuses on four therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes obesity and musculoskeletal disorders cancer and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving recombinant dna therapeutic proteins and antibodies as well as genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function biomarkers and targeted therapeutics in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients we also conduct research in animal health including animal nutrition and physiology control of parasites and veterinary medicine 

to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions 

drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the 

8 process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all stages of development among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for diabetes and its complications osteoporosis cancer and acute coronary syndromes further we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including compounds targeting cancers thrombotic disorders atherosclerosis alzheimer’s disease diabetes obesity and sleep disorders we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our currently marketed products such as zyprexa gemzar alimta cialis cymbalta evista forteo and byetta 

raw materials and product supply 

most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition four of our significant products are manufactured by others actos by takeda reopro by centocor xigris by lonza biologics bulk product and dsm nv finished product and byetta by thirdparty suppliers to amylin if we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes 

our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in indiana as well as locations in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world 

we seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 

quality assurance 

our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers 

9 executive officers of the company

other patent litigation 

during 2005 two generic pharmaceutical manufacturers apotex inc apotex and novopharm ltd novopharm a whollyowned subsidiary of teva challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and methodof use patent expiring in 2011 in canada we currently anticipate a decision from the canadian federal patent court by january 2007 in the apotex case and by september 2007 in the novopharm case the generic companies allege that our patent is invalid obtained by fraud or irrelevant in may 2004 egisgyogyszergyar a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and methodof use patent expiring in 2011 in germany we currently anticipate a decision from the german patent court in 2006 or 2007 in addition to our patents we have data package exclusivity in germany through september 2006 we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of other countries as well including spain china russia and several eastern european countries we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation 

in october 2002 pfizer inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court in delaware against us lilly icos llc and icos corporation alleging that the proposed marketing of cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe its newly issued methodof use patent in september 2003 the us patent and trademark office on its own initiative ordered that pfizer’s patent be reexamined the delaware suit has been stayed pending the outcome of the reexamination in the european union the technical board of appeal of the european patent office revoked pfizer’s methodof use patent in its entirety in february 2005 the uk court of appeal has also held the uk counterpart to this patent invalid litigation relating to the corresponding patent is also pending in australia brazil canada mexico new zealand and south africa we intend to vigorously defend this litigation and expect to prevail however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation  

15 other product liability litigation 

we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability lawsuits in the united states involving primarily zyprexa diethylstilbestrol “des” and thimerosal

we have been named as a defendant in approximately 340 actions in the us involving approximately 1020 claimants brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us beginning in the 1930s we purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to thimerosal in the 1920s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the majority of the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies 

other marketing practices investigations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend executive overview 

this section provides an overview of our financial results product launches and latestage product pipeline developments and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 

financial results 

we achieved worldwide sales growth of 6 percent due in part to the launch in 2004 of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets in addition we launched one new product in the us and several new products new indications or new formulations in key markets in 2005 we continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales despite product launch expenditures our costcontainment and productivity measures 

18 contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales during 2005 we began to expense stock options which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses we also benefited from an increase in net other income due primarily to increased profitability of the lilly icos joint venture and a decrease in the tax rate in 2005 net income was 198 billion or 181 per share in 2005 as compared with 181 billion or 166 per share in 2004 representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 9 percent net income comparisons between 2005 and 2004 are also affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results see notes 1 2 3 4 7 11 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 recent product launches and latestage product pipeline developments 

our longterm success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies we have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and latestage pipeline developments including 

 20 legal and governmental matters 

certain generic manufacturers have challenged our us compound patent for zyprexa and are seeking permission to market generic versions of zyprexa prior to its patent expiration in 2011 on april 14 2005 the us district court in indianapolis ruled in our favor on all counts upholding our patents the decision has been appealed 

in 2005 we entered into an agreement with plaintiffs’ attorneys involved in certain us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims against us relating to the medication we established a fund of 690 million for the claimants who agree to settle their claims additionally we paid 10 million to cover administration of the settlement as a result of our product liability exposures the substantial majority of which were related to zyprexa we recorded a net pretax charge of 107 billion in the second quarter of 2005 

in march 2004 we were notified by the us attorney’s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania that it has commenced a civil investigation relating to our us sales marketing and promotional practices 

in the united states implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma which provides a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program took effect january 1 2006 while it is difficult to predict the business impact of this legislation we currently anticipate a modest shortterm increase in sales however in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures while the mma prohibits the secretary of health and human services hhs from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers we expect continued challenges to that prohibition over the next several years also the mma retains the authority of the secretary of hhs to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs but we expect congress to consider several measures that could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the us regardless of their safety or cost if adopted such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our us sales we believe there is some chance that the new and expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the mma will alleviate the need for a federal importation scheme 

as a result of the passage of the mma aged and disabled patients jointly eligible for medicare and medicaid began receiving their prescription drug benefits through the medicare program instead of medicaid on january 1 2006 this may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level a majority of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their medicaid programs and these programs are expected to continue in the postmma environment several states are also attempting to extend discounted medicaid prices to nonmedicaid patients additionally notwithstanding the federal law prohibiting drug importation approximately a dozen states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens usually involving a website that links patients to selected canadian pharmacies one state has such a program for its state employees as a result we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue 

international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

21 operating results — 2005 

sales 

our worldwide sales for 2005 increased 6 percent to 1465 billion driven primarily by sales growth of cymbalta alimta forteo and gemzar as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early 2005 reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera prozac ®  and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately 170 million sales growth in 2005 was also affected by decreased us demand for zyprexa strattera and prozac despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand sales in the us increased 2 percent to 780 billion driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta and alimta sales outside the us increased 11 percent to 685 billion driven by growth of zyprexa alimta and gemzar worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 3 percent with global selling prices contributing 1 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 1 percent numbers do not add due to rounding

22 zyprexa our topselling product is a treatment for schizophrenia bipolar mania and bipolar maintenance zyprexa sales in the us decreased 16 percent in 2005 resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures sales outside the us in 2005 increased 9 percent driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates excluding the impact of exchange rates sales of zyprexa outside the us increased by 6 percent in september 2005 the national institute of mental health released the results of its clinical antipsychotic trial of intervention effectiveness catie study which showed that zyprexa was statistically superior on time to discontinuation in patients with schizophrenia as compared to other medications patients taking zyprexa also experienced significantly fewer hospitalizations for schizophrenia than patients taking other medications in addition the study noted that zyprexa patients experienced greater weight gain and increases in measures of glucose and lipid metabolism than patients using other antipsychotics

sales of gemzar a product approved to fight various cancers increased 4 percent in the us sales growth in the us in 2005 was negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers gemzar sales increased 15 percent outside the us driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications 

sales of evista a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis decreased 2 percent in the us due to a decline in us underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels this decline was partially offset by price increases outside the us sales of evista increased 11 percent driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in japan 

cymbalta was launched in the us in late august 2004 for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in september 2004 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain cymbalta launches began in europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of 2005 with additional launches expected through 2006 cymbalta has been well accepted generating 6797 million in sales in 2005 

sales of strattera the only nonstimulant medicine approved for the treatment of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder in children adolescents and adults declined 24 percent in the us in 2005 due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand sales outside the us were 534 million in 2005 compared with 103 million in 2004 primarily reflecting recent launches in australia canada germany mexico and spain in the third quarter of 2005 we announced an important update to the strattera label communicating new information regarding uncommon reports of suicidal thoughts among children and adolescents we have added a boxed warning to the label in the us and are working with other regulatory agencies in countries where strattera is approved to update the label information appropriately

animal health product sales in the us increased 9 percent while sales outside the us increased 7 percent led by rumensin and paylean 

gross margin costs and expenses 

the 2005 gross margin decreased to 763 percent of sales compared with 767 percent for 2004 the decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses 

operating expenses the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses increased 8 percent in 2005 investment in research and development increased 12 percent to 303 billion in 2005 due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005 decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing 

25 approximately 21 percent of our sales into research and development during 2005 marketing and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2005 to 450 billion due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005 and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses this comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the lilly foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004 research and development expenses would have increased by 8 percent and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for 2005 if 2004 had been restated as if stock options had been expensed 

net other income for 2005 increased 894 million to 4194 million primarily due to the lilly icos llc joint venture becoming profitable during 2005 and increased interest income partially offset by less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development we report our 50 percent share of the operating results of the lilly icos joint venture in our net other income for 2005 our net income from the joint venture was 111 million compared with a net loss of 790 million in 2004 the joint venture became profitable for the first time in the third quarter of 2005

the effective tax rate for 2005 was 263 percent compared with 385 percent for 2004 the effective tax rate for 2005 was affected by the product liability charge of 107 billion the tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge the effective tax rate for 2004 was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of 800 billion of earnings reinvested outside the us pursuant to the ajca and the charge for acquired iprd related to the ame acquisition which is not deductible for tax purposes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

26 operating results — 2004

zyprexa sales in the us decreased 8 percent in 2004 due to a decline in underlying demand from continued competitive pressures zyprexa sales outside the us increased 22 percent driven by volume growth in a number of major markets outside the us international zyprexa sales growth also benefited from the impact of foreign exchange rates excluding the impact of exchange rates sales of zyprexa outside the us increased 13 percent in 2004 

diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of 261 billion in 2004 an increase of 2 percent diabetes care revenues in the us decreased 6 percent to 149 billion diabetes care revenues outside the us increased 14 percent to 112 billion humulin sales in the us decreased 19 percent driven primarily by volume declines due to competitive pressures humulin sales outside the us increased 7 percent humalog sales in the us increased 3 percent as increased prices offset slight volume declines humalog sales outside the us increased 16 percent to 4162 million actos revenues increased 5 percent in 2004 

sales of gemzar increased 8 percent in the us largely due to the may 2004 approval for the treatment of latestage metastatic breast cancer gemzar sales increased 31 percent outside the us 

28 driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications as well as favorable foreign exchange rates 

sales of evista increased 1 percent in the us due to continued competitive pressures outside the us evista maintained a strong growth rate of 32 percent driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in japan 

in 2004 strattera generated an 80 percent increase over 2003 sales despite a very competitive landscape in december 2004 we added a bolded warning to the product label which indicates that the medication should be discontinued in patients with jaundice yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes or in the event of laboratory evidence of liver injury 

forteo generated 2386 million in sales in 2004 continuing the product’s strong growth trajectory following its us launch in december 2002 and european launches in late 2003 and during 2004 

the 5523 million of worldwide cialis sales in 2004 an increase of 172 percent compared to 2003 comprises 1306 million of sales in our territories which are reported in our net sales and 4217 million of sales in the jointventure territories within the jointventure territories us sales of cialis were 2066 million for 2004

gross margin costs and expenses 

the 2004 gross margin decreased to 767 percent of sales compared with 787 percent for 2003 the decrease was due primarily to continued investment in our manufacturing technical capabilities and capacity and the impact of foreign exchange rates offset partially by favorable changes in product mix due to growth in sales of higher margin products 

operating expenses increased 9 percent in 2004 investment in research and development increased 15 percent to 269 billion due to increased clinical trial and development expenses and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses partially offset by reimbursements for research activities from our collaboration partners we reinvested more than 19 percent of our sales into research and development marketing and administrative expenses increased 6 percent in 2004 to 428 billion attributable primarily to increased selling expenses in support of the new and anticipated product launches the impact of foreign exchange rates increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses increased charitable contributions to the lilly foundation and increased product liability expenses offset partially by ongoing marketing costcontainment measures and marketing expense reimbursement from collaboration partners a majority of the reimbursements are ongoing 

net other income for 2004 increased 1269 million to 3300 million the increase for 2004 was primarily due to income related to the outlicensing of legacy products outside the united states milestone payments from collaborations on the duloxetine molecule income related to a previously assigned patent arrangement of 300 million and other miscellaneous income this was offset partially by an increase in the net loss of the lilly icos llc joint venture due primarily to increased marketing costs of cialis in jointventure territories and the 2003 sale of dapoxetine patent rights for 2004 our net loss from the joint venture was 790 million compared with 524 million in 2003 

the effective tax rate for 2004 was 385 percent compared with 215 percent for 2003 the increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation 

29 of 800 billion of earnings reinvested outside the us pursuant to the ajca and the charge for acquired iprd related to the ame acquisition which is not deductible for tax purposes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

financial condition 

as of december 31 2005 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 504 billion compared with 746 billion at december 31 2004 cash flow from operations of 191 billion and net issuances of longterm debt of 200 billion were more than offset by net repayments of shortterm debt of 199 billion dividends paid of 165 billion capital expenditures of 130 billion net purchases of noncurrent investments of 6380 million and repurchases of common stock of 3779 million 

capital expenditures of 130 billion during 2005 were 6000 million less than in 2004 due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects we expect nearterm capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2005 levels while we continue to invest in the longterm growth of our diabetes care and other products as well as research and development activities 

total debt at december 31 2005 was 650 billion essentially unchanged compared to december 31 2004 our current debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s remain at aa and aa3 respectively 

dividends of 152 per share were paid in 2005 an increase of 7 percent from 2004 in the fourth quarter of 2005 effective for the firstquarter dividend in 2006 the quarterly dividend was increased to 40 per share a 5 percent increase resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2006 of 160 per share the year 2005 was the 121st consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 38th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 

30 on october 22 2004 president bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca which created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations we planned to repatriate 800 billion in incentive dividends as defined in the ajca during 2005 and accordingly we recorded a related tax liability of 4650 million as of december 31 2004 during 2005 we repatriated all 800 billion of eligible incentive dividends the proceeds from the incentive dividends have been or will be used for research and development activities capital asset expenditures and other permitted activities 

we believe that cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating needs including debt service capital expenditures dividends and taxes in 2006 we believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of shortterm borrowings if necessary our commercial paper program is also currently backed by 123 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities we currently expect to repay approximately 15 billion of debt by the end of 2006 using available cash various risks and uncertainties including those discussed in the financial expectations for 2006 section may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 

in the normal course of business our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing investing and operating we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 

our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates in an effort to manage interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between 

31 fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2005 and 2004 including derivatives and other interest rate risksensitive instruments a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period 

our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than the local currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets liabilities commitments and anticipated revenues considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2005 and 2004 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively would have no material impact on earnings cash flows or fair values of foreign currency rate risksensitive instruments over a oneyear period these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset in part by the results of the derivative instruments 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payments they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

these arrangements are not material individually however if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same year the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur as the failure rate for products in development is very high in addition these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives we also note that from a business perspective we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

32 our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions 

 1 our longterm debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps we used the interest rate forward curve at december 31 2005 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 

2 we have included the following 

 3 we have included our longterm liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 

4 this category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements 

the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31 2005 the amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed terminated or modified 

application of critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 

revenue recognition and sales rebate and discount accruals 

we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership this is generally at the time products are shipped to the customer typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

33 we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products or alternative approaches we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio we are generally able to determine when significant wholesaler stocking or destocking has occurred during a particular period but we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking causes of unusual buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues weather patterns anticipated changes in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and changes in wholesaler business operations an unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the us could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend 

as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early 2005 reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera prozac and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately 170 million the new structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying we have seen in the past and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our us wholesalers wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns which have been approximately 1 percent or less of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 

we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales the rebatediscount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales sales rebatesdiscounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid managed care chargebacks longtermcare hospital discount card programs and various other government programs we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebatediscount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebatediscount contracts we calculate these rebatesdiscounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups 

the largest of our sales rebatediscount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later due to the time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients and our product pricing and current rebatediscount contracts 

most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales in some large european countries government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country a best estimate of these rebates updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits is recognized in the same period as the related sale if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit we adjust our rebate reserves 

34 we believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs reduced sales by 6266 million 6410 million and 5676 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively a 5 percent change in the medicaid rebate expense we recognized in 2005 would lead to an approximate 31 million effect on our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as of december 31 2005 our medicaid rebate liability was 2725 million 

approximately 90 percent and 86 percent of our global rebate and discount liability results from sales of our products in the us as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the following represents a rollforward of our most significant us rebate and discount liability balances including medicaid in millions 

 1 adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 03 percent of net sales for each of the years presented 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies 

product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are by their nature uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions if any in addition we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 

we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial position of the insurers and the possibility of and the length of time for collection 

we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 

pension and retiree medical plan assumptions 

pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age and expected return on plan assets retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate retirement age expected return on plan assets and healthcarecost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

35 periodically we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans in evaluating these assumptions we consider many factors including an evaluation of the discount rates expected return on plan assets and the healthcarecost trend rates of other companies our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments and the views of leading financial advisers and economists we use an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve for purposes of determination of the discount rate in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 

we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors if the healthcarecost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2005 annual expense would increase by approximately 26 million a onepercentagepoint decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2005 service cost and interest cost by approximately 22 million if the discount rate for 2005 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately 27 million if the expected return on plan assets for 2005 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately 13 million if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for 2005 were adjusted by one year our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would be affected by approximately 22 million 

income taxes 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated the tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances and additional uncertainties for example adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 

we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances reserved against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances a 5 percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately 23 million 

36 financial expectations for 2006 

for the full year of 2006 we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 310 to 320 we expect sales to grow 7 to 9 percent and gross margins as a percent of sales to improve modestly compared with 2005 in addition we expect operating expenses to grow in the midsingle digits in the aggregate with marketing and administrative expenses accelerating while research and development expense growth moderates somewhat however we will continue to be among the industry leaders in terms of research and development investment as a percent of sales we also expect other income net of interest expense to contribute approximately 175 million to 275 million this ongoing net contribution is expected to be driven primarily by net interest income lilly icos joint venture aftertax profit and partnering and outlicensing of molecules we also anticipate the effective tax rate to be approximately 21 percent 

actual results could differ materially and will depend on among other things the continuing growth of our currently marketed products developments with competitive products the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches asset impairments restructurings and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired inprocess research and development charges foreign exchange rates wholesaler inventory changes other regulatory developments litigation and government investigations the outcome of the zyprexa patent appeal and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing importation and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals we undertake no duty to update these forwardlooking statements 

legal and regulatory matters 

three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers zenith goldline pharmaceuticals inc zenith dr reddy’s laboratories ltd reddy and teva pharmaceuticals teva submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas seeking permission to market generic versions of zyprexa in various dosage forms several years prior to the expiration of our us patents for the product the generic companies alleged that our patents are invalid unenforceable or not infringed we filed suit against the three companies in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that the challenges to our compound patent expiring in 2011 are without merit the cases were consolidated and on april 14 2005 the district court upheld our 2011 us patent on zyprexa in the case of eli lilly and company v zenith goldline pharmaceuticals et al the court ruled in our favor on all counts including the patent doctrines of obviousness double patenting inequitable conduct novelty and public use the decision has been appealed we are confident and the trial court confirmed that the generic manufacturers’ claims are without merit and we expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail on appeal an unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

in 2002 barr laboratories inc barr submitted an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of evista raloxifene several years prior to the expiration of our us patents covering the product alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed in november 2002 we filed suit against barr in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the methods of use and pharmaceutical form expiring from 2012 to 2017 are without merit barr has also asserted that the method of use patents are unenforceable the us patent and trademark office issued to us two new patents expiring in 2017 directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing raloxifene and a 

37 method for preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis and a third expiring in 2012 directed to methods of inhibiting postmenopausal bone loss by administering a single daily oral dose of raloxifene these patents have been listed in the fda’s orange book barr has challenged these patents alleging that each is invalid unenforceable or will not be infringed these patents have been added to the pending suit the suit is in discovery no trial date has been set at this time while we believe that barr’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

in january 2006 we were notified that sicor pharmaceuticals inc sicor a subsidiary of teva submitted an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of gemzar several years prior to the expiration of two us patents covering the product sicor alleged that both us patents are invalid in february we filed suit against sicor in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that sicor’s challenges to our patents claiming the compound expiring in 2010 and the methods of use expiring in 2012 are without merit while we believe that sicor’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

in july 2002 we received the first of several grand jury subpoenas for documents from the office of consumer litigation us department of justice related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to evista we reached a settlement with the us department of justice in the fourth quarter of 2005 which was subsequently approved by the us district court for the southern district of indiana in february 2006 as part of the settlement lilly pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act the plea is for the offlabel promotion of evista during 1998 the government did not however charge the company with any unlawful intent nor do we acknowledge any such intent in connection with the overall settlement we agreed to pay a total of 36 million as previously reported lilly took a charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 in connection with this investigation the 2004 charge was sufficient to cover this settlement payment consequently no further charge will be necessary 

in march 2004 the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania advised us that it has commenced a civil investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors with respect to zyprexa prozac and prozac weekly tm  in october 2005 the us attorney’s office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering axid evista humalog humulin prozac and zyprexa the inquiry includes a review of lilly’s medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements we are cooperating with the us attorney in these investigations including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations in june 2005 we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general medicaid fraud control unit of the state of florida seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa it is possible that other lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines penalties or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome it is possible however that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on 

38 our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position we have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliancerelated activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices physician communications remuneration of health care professionals managed care arrangements and medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the united states and have been notified of several thousand claims of individuals who have not filed suit the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the “claims” allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 1596 the mdl includes three lawsuits requesting certification of class actions on behalf of those who allegedly suffered injuries from the administration of zyprexa we have entered into agreements with various plaintiffs’ counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitation tolling agreements with respect to a large number of claimants who do not have lawsuits on file 

in june 2005 we entered into an agreement in principle followed by a definitive master settlement agreement in september 2005 with a group of plaintiffs’ attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims the agreement covers more than 8000 claimants including a large number of previously filed lawsuits including the three purported class actions tolled claims and other informally asserted claims we established a fund of 690 million for the claimants to settle their claims and 10 million to cover administration of the settlement the settlement fund is being overseen and distributed by claims administrators appointed by the court the agreement and the distribution of funds to participating claimants are conditioned upon among other things our obtaining full releases from no fewer than 7193 claimants 

following this settlement the remaining us zyprexa product liability claims include approximately 150 lawsuits in the us covering 465 claimants and approximately 825 tolled claims in addition we have been informally advised of a number of additional potential us claims but to date have received no substantiation of the claims also in early 2005 we were served with five lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the united states we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining cases 

in 2005 two lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors excluding governmental entities which have made or will make payments on account of their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes the federal civil rico statute and common law theories seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa treble damages punitive damages and attorneys’ fees in addition in 2006 a similar lawsuit was filed in the eastern district of new york on similar grounds as with the product liability suits these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 

in december 2004 we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed 

39 to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york in these actions the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drugbenefit programs as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexarelated illnesses 

in connection with the zyprexa product liability claims certain of our insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and to date have failed to reimburse us for claimrelated costs despite demand from the firstlayer carriers for payment however in our opinion the defenses identified to date appear to lack substance in march 2005 we filed suit against several of the carriers in state court in indiana to obtain reimbursement of costs related to the zyprexa product liability litigation the matter has been removed to the federal court in indianapolis several carriers have asserted defenses to their liability and some carriers are seeking rescission of the coverage while we believe our position is meritorious there can be no assurance that we will prevail 

in addition we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal 

with respect to the product liability claims currently asserted against us we have accrued for our estimated exposures to the extent they are both probable and estimable based on the information available to us in addition we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingencies are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable a portion of the costs associated with defending and disposing of these suits is covered by insurance we record receivables for insurancerelated recoveries when it is probable they will be realized these receivables are classified as a reduction of the litigation charges on the statement of income we estimate insurance recoverables based on existing deductibles coverage limits our assessment of any defenses to coverage that might be raised by the carriers and the existing and projected future level of insolvencies among the insurance carriers 

in the second quarter of 2005 we recorded a net pretax charge of 107 billion for product liability matters which includes the following 

 the 107 billion net charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters the aftertax impact of this net charge was 90 per share the 700 million for the zyprexa settlement was paid during 2005 while the cash related to the other reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs is expected to be paid out over the next several years the timing of our insurance recoveries is uncertain 

we cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted in addition although we believe it is probable there can be no assurance that the zyprexa 

40 settlement described above will be concluded the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position 

we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for other products in the future we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market and therefore will be largely selfinsured for future product liability losses in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims 

while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the patent product liability or other legal actions brought against us we believe that except as noted above the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to the consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period

eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” which may be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment—pharmaceutical products we also have an animal health business segment whose operations are not material to our financial statements we manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the united states puerto rico and 22 other countries our products are sold in approximately 140 countries most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products we direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat human diseases we also conduct research to find products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production products our principal products are   neuroscience products  our largestselling product group including    endocrine products  including  1 

   oncology products  including    animal health products  including    cardiovascular agents  including    antiinfectives  including    other pharmaceutical products  including  marketing we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs pharmaceuticals – united states in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country three wholesale distributors in the united states – amerisourcebergen 2 

corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation – each accounted for between 13 and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2004 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material beginning in 2005 we have restructured our arrangements with our us wholesalers we believe that the new arrangements will provide us with competitive distribution costs as well as more reliable data about wholesaler inventory levels and will reduce the speculative buying by wholesalers that has sometimes affected us sales growth trends for certain products we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians wholesalers hospitals managedcare organizations retail pharmacists and other health care professionals we advertise in medical and drug journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are assigned to product lines or practice areas such as primary care neuroscience acute care endocrinology and oncology large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups government agencies and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we have created special sales groups to service managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospital contract administrators and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with a number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more lilly products or other costsharing arrangements pharmaceuticals – outside the united states outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations in some countries however we market our products through independent distributors pharmaceutical marketing collaborations several of our significant products are marketed in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies  we have also entered into licensing arrangements under which we have granted exclusive marketing rights to other companies in specified countries for certain older products manufactured by us such as permax sarafem vancocin the antiulcer agent axid ®  the analgesic darvon ®  and the antiinfectives ceclor keflex ®  keftab ®  and lorabid ®  3 

animal health products our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states to market animal health products elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors raw materials and product supply most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition three of our significant products are manufactured by others actos by takeda reopro by centocor and xigris by lonza biologics bulk product and dsm nv finished product if we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in indiana as well as locations in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights overview intellectual property protection is in the aggregate material to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents both in the united states and in other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products outside the united states the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners however in many countries this agreement will not become fully effective for many years it is still too soon to assess when and how much if at all we will benefit commercially from these changes 4 

when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company may achieve exclusivity beyond the expiry of the product patent through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on methods of use or formulations or databased exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws our intellectual property portfolio we consider intellectual property protection for certain products processes and uses – particularly that relating to zyprexa gemzar humalog evista actos reopro xigris strattera cialis alimta and cymbalta – to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent united states compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective active ingredients in zyprexa 2011 humalog 2013 and reopro 2015 the gemzar compound patent in the us expires in 2010 but a methodofuse patent covering treatment of neoplasms with gemzar is in force until 2012 we hold a number of us patents covering evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in the united states until at least 2012 in the united states the actos compound patent extends beyond the duration of our copromotion agreement which is in force until 2006 xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic product that is produced through recombinant dna technology xigris is not subject to the abbreviated new drug application process under the hatchwaxman law as described below in addition we hold patents on the dna materials certain uses manufacturing process and the glycoprotein itself we believe the intellectual property protection for xigris should provide us marketing exclusivity in the us until 2015 for strattera a methodofuse patent in the us for treating attention deficithyperactivity disorder should provide exclusivity until 2016 for cialis compound and methodofuse patent protection exists in the us that should provide exclusivity until 2017 the us compound patent for alimta expires in 2011 but we have applied for a patent term extension that we expect will extend the patent until 2016 for cymbalta the us compound patent expires in 2008 but we have applied for a patent term extension that we expect will extend the patent until 2013 we also have a formulation patent for cymbalta until 2014 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms patent challenges under the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws in the united states before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the food and drug administration fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative medicines without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug – not safety and efficacy absent a successful patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the 5 

innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents if one or more of the ndalisted patents are successfully challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on zyprexa evista and sarafem in the sarafem litigation we prevailed at trial and the challenger has appealed to the court of appeals for the federal circuit for more information on the zyprexa and evista patent litigation see part 1 item 3 legal proceedings competition our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of animal health care companies as well as pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries important competitive factors include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service and research and development of new products and processes if competitors introduce new products delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded product loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or “knockoff” versions of our products to successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative costeffective products that serve unmet medical needs together with our ability to continuously improve the productivity of our discovery development manufacturing marketing and support operations in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors government regulation our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical and animal health products are extensively regulated in all major world markets we are required to conduct extensive postmarketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture 6 

and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over virtually all of our businesses and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda also regulates our animal health products the us environmental protection agency also regulates some animal health products new drugs may now be approved across the european union eu using the european commission’s centralized approval process or using the national mutual recognition process the use of either of these procedures provides a more consistent and in some cases a more rapid approval within the eu member states than was the case when each member state operated its own approval process the fda extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations in recent years we have made and we continue to make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing product and process development and quality operations to ensure sustained cgmp compliance however in the event we fail to adhere to cgmp requirements in the future we could be subject to interruptions in production civil and criminal penalties and delays in new product approvals the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks and false claims these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years both the fda and many of these other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies over this period several cases brought by these agencies against other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements several pharmaceutical companies including lilly are currently subject to proceedings by one or more of these agencies regarding marketing and promotional practices see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for information about currently pending marketing and promotional practices investigations in which we are involved it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in such an action could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls reference pricing discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses health economic assessments and generic substitution in the us we expect branded pharmaceutical products to be subject to increasing pricing pressures implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 7 

mma providing a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program will take effect january 1 2006 while it is difficult to predict the business impact of this legislation prior to 2006 we currently anticipate a relatively neutral shortterm impact due to offsets of price and volume in various customer groups however in the long term there is additional risk associated with increased pricing pressures while the mma prohibits the secretary of health and human services hhs from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers we expect continued challenges to that prohibition over the next several years also the mma retains the authority of the secretary of health and human services to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs but we expect congress to consider several measures that could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the us regardless of their safety or cost if adopted such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our us sales we are encouraged by the release of the hhs task force report on importation which concludes that the safety and possible cost savings of an importation scheme are questionable as a result of the passage of the mma aged and disabled patients jointly eligible for medicare and medicaid will receive their prescription drug benefits through medicare instead of medicaid beginning january 1 2006 this may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures a majority of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their medicaid programs and these programs are expected to continue in the postmma environment several states are also attempting to extend discounted medicaid prices to nonmedicaid patients additionally notwithstanding the federal law prohibiting pharmaceutical importation nine states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens usually involving a website that links patients to selected canadian pharmacies one state has such a program for its state employees in the absence of federal action to curtail state activities we expect other states to launch importation efforts as a result we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will continue in the near term research and development our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2004 we employed approximately 8450 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 215 billion in 2002 235 billion in 2003 and 269 billion in 2004 to improve productivity in 2004 we terminated our research in the area of inflammation and reallocated resources to other areas of rd thus narrowing our pharmaceutical research and development focus from five to four therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes and osteoporosis cancer and cardiovascular diseases however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving recombinant dna therapeutic proteins and antibodies as well as genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function biomarkers and targeted therapeutics in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and 8 

formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients we also conduct research in the animal sciences including animal nutrition and physiology control of parasites and veterinary medicine to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes 12 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new compounds and new indications for existing compounds that we have in all stages of development among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for diabetes and its complications osteoporosis cancer and acute coronary syndromes further we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development including compounds targeting cancers thrombotic disorders atherosclerosis alzheimer’s disease diabetes obesity and sleep disorders we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our important currently marketed products such as alimta cialis cymbalta evista reopro and symbyax quality assurance our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers executive officers of the company the following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers all executive officers have been employed by the company in executive positions during the last five years the term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors to be held on april 18 2005 or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified no director or executive officer of the company has a “family relationship” with any other director or executive officer of the company as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement 9

we believe that none of our properties is subject to any encumbrance easement or other restriction that would detract materially from its value or impair its use in the operation of the business the buildings we own are of varying ages and in good condition 




 item 3 legal proceedings we are a party to various currently pending legal actions government investigations and environmental proceedings and we anticipate that such actions could be brought against us in the future the most significant of these matters are described below while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions investigations and proceedings described below we believe that except as otherwise specifically noted below with respect to the us zyprexa and evista patent litigation the zyprexa product liability litigation and the us marketing practices investigation involving zyprexa prozac and prozac weekly the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period zyprexa patent litigation three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers zenith goldline pharmaceuticals inc zenith dr reddy’s laboratories ltd reddy and teva pharmaceuticals teva have submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas seeking permission to market generic versions of zyprexa in various dosage forms and formulations including the zydis® formulation several years prior to the expiration of our us patents for the product alleging that our patents are invalid not infringed or unenforceable in april 2001 we filed suit against zenith in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that the challenges to our compound patent expiring in 2011 are without merit we filed similar suits in the same court against reddy in june 2001 and teva in september 2002 the cases have been consolidated a trial before a district court judge in indianapolis was held in january and february of 2004 and we are awaiting a ruling from the trial court regardless of the trial court’s ruling we anticipate that appeals will follow if we are unsuccessful at the trial court level we cannot predict whether any of the generic companies would launch generic versions of zyprexa prior to a final resolution of any appeals in october 2004 we were notified that barr laboratories inc barr submitted an anda seeking permission to market the zydis formulation of zyprexa asserting that our patents covering zydis are invalid not infringed or unenforceable in december 2004 we filed suit against barr in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that barr’s patent challenges are without merit that suit has now been stayed pending the decision of the trial court in the zenithreddyteva case described above we believe that the generic manufacturers’ claims are without merit and we expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position in may 2004 egisgyogyszergyar a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and methodofuse patents expiring in 2011 in germany we currently anticipate a decision from the german patent court in 2006 in addition to our patents we have data package exclusivity in germany through september 2006 we are vigorously contesting the legal challenge to this patent we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation 12 

other patent litigation in october 2002 we were notified that barr had submitted an anda with the us fda seeking permission to market a generic version of evista several years prior to the expiration of our us patents covering the product alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed in november 2002 we filed suit against barr in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the method of use and pharmaceutical form expiring from 2012 to 2017 are without merit recently barr has also asserted that the methodofuse patents are unenforceable on september 28 2004 the us patent and trademark office issued to us a new patent expiring in 2017 directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing raloxifene barr has challenged this patent alleging that the patent is invalid unenforceable or will not be infringed this patent has been added to the lawsuit the suit is in discovery and the trial is now scheduled to begin in february 2006 while we believe that barr’s claims are without merit and expect to prevail it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position in october 2002 pfizer inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court in delaware against us lilly icos llc and icos corporation alleging that the proposed marketing of cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe its newly issued methodofuse patent in september 2003 the us patent and trademark office on its own initiative ordered that pfizer’s patent be reexamined the delaware suit has been stayed pending the outcome of the reexamination previously pfizer’s corresponding european methodofuse patent was held invalid in the first stage of an opposition proceeding in the european patent office pfizer has appealed that decision and in february 2005 the technical board of appeal of the european patent office revoked pfizer’s methodofuse patent in its entirety the uk court of appeal has also held the uk counterpart to this patent invalid litigation relating to the corresponding patent is also pending in australia brazil canada mexico new zealand and south africa we intend to vigorously defend this litigation and expect to prevail however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail product liability litigation we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability lawsuits in the united states involving primarily zyprexa diethylstilbestrol “des” and thimerosal we have been named in approximately 140 product liability cases in the united states involving approximately 360 claimants alleging a variety of injuries from the administration of zyprexa most of the cases allege that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels the suits seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa and many of the suits also allege that we improperly promoted the drug we are vigorously defending these suits all the federal cases involving approximately 330 claimants have been or will be transferred to the honorable jack weinstein in the us district court for the eastern district of new york for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings two cases requesting certification of nationwide class actions on behalf of those who allegedly suffered injuries from the administration of zyprexa were filed in the us district court for the eastern district of new york on april 16 2004 and may 19 2004 respectively the cases seek damages for alleged personal injuries and also seek compensation for medical monitoring of individuals who have taken zyprexa a lawsuit was also filed that requests a class action on behalf of iowa residents who took zyprexa and that case has been transferred to the federal court in new york in addition we have entered into agreements with various plaintiffs’ counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitation tolling agreements with respect to more than 3050 individuals who do not have lawsuits on file and may or may not eventually file suits this provides counsel additional time to evaluate the potential claims in exchange the individuals have agreed not to file suits in state courts and the 13 

plaintiffs steering committee agreed to dismiss the personal injury claims in the two pending nationwide class actions the class action claims seeking medical monitoring for zyprexa patients are not affected by this agreement in december 2004 we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high bloodglucose levels and that we improperly promoted the drug in these actions which we have removed to federal court the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drug benefit programs and the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexarelated illnesses in early 2005 we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa the allegations in these suits are similar to those in the litigation pending in the united states the number of product liability lawsuits and tolled claims relating to zyprexa continues to increase and we cannot predict at this time the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted as noted we are vigorously defending this litigation however product litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable with the risk of excessive verdicts not justified by the evidence accordingly it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the zyprexa product liability litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position in approximately 125 us actions involving approximately 200 claimants plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed des during pregnancy we have been named as a defendant in approximately 340 actions in the us involving approximately 1020 claimants brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us from the 1930s until approximately 2000 we purchased patents and conducted research pertaining to thimerosal in the 1920s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies we have obtained product liability insurance from commercial carriers providing coverage with respect to the claims involving the products noted above subject to deductibles selfinsurance and coverage limits however there can be no assurance that the coverage amounts will be sufficient to cover all exposures or that the carriers will not assert defenses to coverage in addition as a result of external events product liability insurance has become much more difficult to obtain consequently product liability claims could produce exposures that we would manage largely as selfinsured risks 14 

marketing practices investigations in july 2002 we received a grand jury subpoena for documents from the office of consumer litigation department of justice related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to evista we received subpoenas seeking additional documents in july 2003 july 2004 and august 2004 we have provided a broad range of information concerning our us marketing and promotional practices including documents relating to communications with physicians and the remuneration of physician consultants and advisers we continue to cooperate with the government and are currently in advanced discussions to resolve the matter in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a provision for 360 million which we believe will be sufficient to resolve the matter in march 2004 the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania advised us that it has commenced a civil investigation relating to our us marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa prozac and prozac weekly we are cooperating with the us attorney in this investigation and are providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigation including documents relating to communications with physicians and the remuneration of physician consultants and advisers it is possible that other lilly products could become subject to this investigation and that the outcome of this matter could include criminal charges and fines andor civil penalties we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this matter or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome it is possible however that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position we have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliancerelated activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices physician communications and remuneration of health care professionals comply with promotional laws and regulations in august 2003 we received notice that the staff of the sec is conducting an investigation into the compliance by polish subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies including lilly with the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the staff has issued subpoenas to us requesting production of documents related to the investigation we are cooperating with the sec in responding to the investigation other matters in march 2001 we received a subpoena issued at the request of the commonwealth’s attorney for the commonwealth of massachusetts for production of documents related to pricing and medicaid reimbursement of our products in massachusetts we are not the only pharmaceutical company to receive such a request we cooperated with the inquiry and have received no further requests we believe that all of our practices have been lawful and proper in 2003 three counties in new york suffolk rockland and westchester sued us and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers claiming in general that as a result of alleged improprieties by the manufacturers in the calculation and reporting of average wholesale prices for purposes of medicaid reimbursement the counties overpaid their portion of the cost of pharmaceuticals in 2004 nassau county and new york city filed similar suits the suits seek monetary and other relief including civil penalties and treble damages the five new york suits have been transferred to the us district court for the district of massachusetts for pretrial proceedings along with several other suits to which lilly is not a party litigation activity in the new york cases has been stayed pending a decision on a motion to dismiss a motion to dismiss that was filed by all of the defendants in the suffolk county case has been granted in part and denied in part our individual motion to dismiss has been granted in part and we are awaiting a ruling on the remaining issues because of the similarities of the new york cases the court’s ruling in the suffolk county case will likely set a precedent in the other cases in july 2004 central alabama comprehensive healthcare inc filed a similar suit in alabama relating to public health 15 

service pricing the suit seeks injunctive and monetary relief the allegations in the lawsuit are based on a report issued by the office of the inspector general for health and human services oig that was subsequently withdrawn by the oig because it was based on flawed data we and the other defendants have filed motions to dismiss which are pending while we are vigorously defending all these cases given their early procedural stage we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation during 2004 we along with several other pharmaceutical companies were named in one consolidated case in minnesota federal court brought on behalf of consumers alleging that the conduct of pharmaceutical companies in preventing commercial importation of prescription drugs from outside the united states violated antitrust laws and one case in california state court brought by several pharmacies in which plaintiffs’ claims are less specifically stated but seem to be substantially similar to the claims asserted in minnesota the minnesota case seeks a class action certification both cases seek restitution for alleged overpayments for pharmaceuticals and an injunction against the allegedly violative conduct we and the other defendants have filed a motion to dismiss in the minnesota case which is pending the magistrate judge has recommended that the motion to dismiss be granted as to the federal claims and denied as to the state law claims in the california case the court has granted a motion to dismiss by the defendants but permitted the plaintiffs to refile their complaint which plaintiffs have now done while we intend to vigorously defend these suits given their early procedural stage we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund we have been designated as one of several potentially responsible parties with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites under superfund each responsible party may be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the cleanup we are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations including product liability and patent suits of a character we regard as normal to our business

 item 1   business tableend 

eli lilly and company the “company” or “registrant” which may be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” was incorporated in 1901 in indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment—pharmaceutical products operations of our animal health business segment are not material to our financial statements we manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the united states puerto rico and 17 other countries our products are sold in approximately 140 countries most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products we direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to prevent and treat human diseases we also conduct research to find products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production products our products include  1  marketing we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs pharmaceuticals – united states in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country three wholesale distributors in the united states – amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation – each accounted for between 15 and 16 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2003 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians wholesalers hospitals managedcare organizations retail pharmacists and other health care professionals we advertise in medical and drug journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are dedicated to product lines or practice areas such as primary care neuroscience diabetes care acute care endocrinology and oncology we have entered into licensing arrangements under which other companies market certain products manufactured by us such as darvon sarafem axid keftab lorabid and permax large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups and government and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we have created special sales groups to service managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospital contract administrators and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive 2 pressures we have entered into arrangements with a number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more company products or other costsharing arrangements pharmaceuticals – outside the united states outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations in some countries however we market our products through independent distributors animal health products our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states to market animal health products elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors raw materials and product supply most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition three of our significant products are manufactured by others actos by takeda reopro by centocor and xigris by lonza biologics bulk product and dsm nv finished product if we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes our primary bulk manufacturing occurs at three sites in indiana as well as locations in ireland puerto rico and the united kingdom finishing operations including labeling and packaging take place at a number of sites throughout the world we seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights overview intellectual property protection is in the aggregate material to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents both in the united states and in other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing 3 alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products outside the united states the standard of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely while many countries have reasonably strong patent laws other countries currently provide little or no effective protection for inventions or other intellectual property rights under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners however in many countries this agreement will not become fully effective for many years it is possible that changes to this agreement will be made in the future that will diminish or further delay its implementation in developing countries it is too soon to assess how much if at all we will benefit commercially from these changes when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in a severe and rapid decline in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company can obtain additional commercial benefits through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on processes uses or formulations trademark use or marketing exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws our intellectual property portfolio we consider patent protection for certain products processes and uses – particularly that relating to zyprexa gemzar humalog evista actos reopro xigris strattera and cialis – to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent united states compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective active ingredients in zyprexa 2011 humalog 2013 and reopro 2015 the gemzar compound patent in the us expires in 2010 but a use patent covering treatment of neoplasms with gemzar is in force until 2012 we hold a number of us patents covering evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in the united states until at least 2012 in the united states the actos compound patent extends beyond the duration of our copromotion agreement which is in force until 2006 xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic product that is produced through recombinant dna technology xigris is not subject to the abbreviated new drug application process under the hatchwaxman law as described below in addition we hold patents on the dna materials certain uses manufacturing process and the glycoprotein itself we believe the intellectual property protection for xigris should provide us marketing exclusivity until 2015 for strattera we hold a use patent in the us for treating attention deficithyperactivity disorder the sole approved use of the drug this use patent expires in 2015 and we have applied for a patent term extension to 2016 for cialis compound and method of use patent protection exists into 2016 and we have applied for a patent term extension into 2017 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms patent challenges under the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws in the united 4 states before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the food and drug administration fda complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application nda hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative medicines without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug – not safety and efficacy absent a successful patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents if one or more of the ndalisted patents are successfully challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on zyprexa evista and sarafem for more information on the zyprexa and evista patent litigation see part 1 item 3 legal proceedings the fda has recently finalized regulations clarifying the process by which patents can be listed with the fda by innovators in addition congress made significant changes to the hatchwaxman law as part of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 by allowing only a single 30month period during which the approval of any individual generic drug application can be delayed while patent issues are resolved finally the socalled “generic exclusivity” provisions that provide incentives for generic companies to challenge drug patents were substantially tightened by congress new statutory provisions now mandate sharing the generic exclusivity in certain situations and may require forfeiting the exclusivity altogether andor further limit the socalled “exclusivity parking” after a patent challenge has been completed collectively these regulatory and statutory changes are not expected to significantly affect the operation of the hatchwaxman law as it relates to our ability to realize patentbased exclusivity for new drugs competition our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries important competitive factors include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service and research and development of new products and processes if competitors introduce new products delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded product loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or “knockoff” versions of our products to successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must often demonstrate that 5 our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative costeffective products that serve unmet medical needs together with our ability to manufacture the products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become outmoded from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors government regulation our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agencies the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major world markets in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment of particular importance is the fda in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda has jurisdiction over virtually all of our businesses and administers requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and postmarketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products the fda along with the us department of agriculture usda and the us environmental protection agency epa also regulates our animal health products since 1995 the approval of new drugs across the european union eu has been possible using the european medicines evaluation agency’s emea centralized approval process or using the national mutual recognition process the use of either of these procedures provides a more consistent and in some cases a more rapid approval within the eu member states than was the case when each member state operated its own approval process in addition the marketing promotional and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act and state laws governing kickbacks and false claims these laws are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorneys general over the past several years many of those agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies over this period several cases brought by these agencies against other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements in recent months several pharmaceutical companies have received subpoenas from one or more of these agencies regarding promotional practices with respect to a variety of products including neuroscience products it is possible that we could become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by those governmental agencies such actions could include claims for civil penalties including treble damages under the false claims act criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from federal health care programs it is possible that an adverse outcome in such an action could have a material adverse impact on the company see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for currently pending matters involving the company 6 in the united states we are required to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs in addition a model waiver program has been created administratively that allows states to expand the medicaid drug benefit to include lowincome medicare beneficiaries other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses and generic substitution in the us we expect branded pharmaceutical products to be subject to increasing pricing pressures in december 2003 president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma providing a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program beginning in 2006 this is expected to put downward pressure on prescription drug prices this pressure may be offset by volume increases but the business impact of this legislation will not be known until implementation in 2006 while the mma retains the authority of the secretary of health and human services to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs several bills have been introduced that would remove that authority and allow for the immediate importation of products into the us regardless of their safety or cost such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our us sales as a result of the passage of the mma all the aged and many of the disabled medicaid recipients will receive their benefits through the medicare program in the future this should relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in less pricing pressure a number of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their medicaid programs several states are also attempting to extend discounted medicaid prices to nonmedicaid patients additionally over 25 states are considering proposals that would result in the importation of prescription drugs for state employees state beneficiaries and in some cases state citizens as a result we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will continue and likely intensify in the near term research and development our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2003 we employed approximately 8800 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 224 billion in 2001 215 billion in 2002 and 235 billion in 2003 we concentrate our pharmaceutical research and development efforts in five therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes and osteoporosis cancer cardiovascular diseases and inflammation however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving recombinant dna proteins and genomics the development of therapeutics through 7 identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients we also conduct research in the animal sciences including animal nutrition and physiology and veterinary medicine to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with others including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of new products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes 10 to 15 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new pharmaceutical compounds and indications we have in all stages of development among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for depression stress urinary incontinence diabetes and its complications osteoporosis and acute coronary syndrome further we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our important currently marketed products such as zyprexa gemzar evista reopro and alimta quality assurance our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers as a result of preapproval plant inspections for zyprexa intramuscular and forteo in early 2001 the fda informed us of a number of observations and issued a warning letter regarding adherence to current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations in response we have been implementing comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing operations in the fall of 2002 we provided the fda with a comprehensive plan to upgrade our manufacturing and quality operations particularly at our injectable and dry products facilities in indianapolis in late october 2003 the fda advised us that the agency now considers our injectable and dry products facilities in indianapolis to have reached a level of cgmp compliance that will allow preapproval site 8 inspections for products under review no further regulatory action is expected at this time although the fda assessment is an important milestone we still have considerable work to do to reach our ultimate goal of building and sustaining worldclass manufacturing product and process development and quality capabilities executive officers of the company the

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend 

zyprexa patent litigation three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers zenith goldline pharmaceuticals inc zenith dr reddy’s laboratories ltd reddy and teva pharmaceuticals teva have submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas seeking permission to market generic versions of zyprexa in various dosage forms several years prior to the expiration of our us patents for the product alleging that our patents are invalid or not infringed in april 2001 we filed suit against zenith in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that the challenges to our compound patent expiring in 2011 are without merit we filed similar suits in the same court against reddy in june 2001 and teva in september 2002 the cases have been consolidated a trial before a district court judge in indianapolis was held in january and february of 2004 and the parties are now in the process of submitting posttrial briefs a ruling from the trial court is expected in the second or third quarter of 2004 regardless of the trial court’s ruling we anticipate that appeals will follow if we are unsuccessful at the trial court level we cannot predict whether any of the generic companies would launch generic versions of zyprexa prior to a final resolution of any appeals we believe that the generic manufacturers’ claims are without merit and we expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position other patent litigation in october 2002 we were notified that barr laboratories inc had submitted an anda with the us fda seeking permission to market a generic version of evista several years prior to the expiration of our us patents covering the product alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed in november 2002 we filed suit against barr in the us district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the method of use and pharmaceutical form expiring from 2012 to 2017 are without merit in june 2003 barr added a challenge to one of our additional patents expiring in 2017 claiming a component in the pharmaceutical form of evista that patent has been added to the lawsuit the suit is in discovery with a trial date currently proposed for august 2005 while we believe that barr’s claims are without merit and expect to prevail it is not 11 possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position in october 2002 pfizer inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court in delaware against us lilly icos llc and icos corporation alleging that the proposed marketing of cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe its newly issued methodofuse patent in september 2003 the us patent and trademark office on its own initiative ordered that pfizer’s patent be reexamined the delaware suit has been stayed pending the outcome of the reexamination previously pfizer’s corresponding european methodofuse patent was held invalid in the first stage of an opposition proceeding in the european patent office pfizer is now appealing that decision to the technical board of appeal of the european patent office a hearing is expected in the second half of 2004 the uk court of appeal has previously held the uk counterpart to this patent invalid litigation relating to the corresponding patent is pending in australia brazil canada mexico new zealand and south africa we intend to vigorously defend this litigation and expect to prevail however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail product liability litigation we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability litigation lawsuits in the united states involving primarily diethylstilbestrol “des” and thimerosal in approximately 115 us actions including several with multiple claimants plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who were prescribed des during pregnancy we have been named as a defendant in approximately 315 actions in the us involving approximately 820 claimants brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us from the 1930’s until approximately 2000 we discovered and developed thimerosal in the 1920’s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers as well as lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies we have been named in approximately 15 product liability cases in the united states involving plaintiffs claiming a variety of injuries from the administration of zyprexa most of the cases allege that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels we are vigorously defending these suits our request that the zyprexa matters pending in federal courts be consolidated in a multidistrict litigation mdl before one federal judge for pretrial purposes will be considered on march 23 2004 12 other matters in july 2002 we received a grand jury subpoena for documents from the office of consumer litigation department of justice related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to evista we received a second subpoena seeking additional documents in july 2003 we continue to cooperate with the government and have provided a broad range of information concerning our us marketing and promotional practices including documents relating to communications with physicians and the remuneration of physician consultants and advisers we continue to review and enhance policies and procedures designed to assure that our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications comply with promotional laws and regulations in recent months several pharmaceutical companies have received subpoenas from government agencies with respect to a variety of products including a number of neuroscience products it is possible that other lilly products including zyprexa could become subject to investigation it is possible that the outcome of the above matters could include criminal charges and fines andor civil penalties we cannot predict or determine the outcome of the above matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome it is possible however that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position liquidity and results of operations in august 2003 we received notice that the staff of the sec is conducting an investigation into the compliance by polish subsidiaries of certain pharmaceutical companies including lilly with the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the staff has issued subpoenas requesting production of documents related to the investigation we are cooperating with the sec in responding to the investigation in march 1996 the us federal trade commission ftc commenced a nonpublic antitrust investigation focusing on the pharmaceutical industry practice of providing discounts or rebates to managedcare organizations and certain other purchasers we are cooperating with the investigation and have responded to two subpoenas from the ftc requesting production of certain documents and other discovery responses we have received no additional requests for documents or information for several years we believe that all of our actions have been lawful and proper in march 2001 we received a subpoena issued at the request of the commonwealth’s attorney for the commonwealth of massachusetts for production of documents related to pricing and medicaid reimbursement of our products in massachusetts we are not the only pharmaceutical company to receive such a request we are cooperating with the inquiry and we believe that all of our practices have been lawful and proper in 2003 three counties in new york suffolk rockland and westchester sued lilly and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers claiming in general that as a result of alleged improprieties by the manufacturers in the calculation and reporting of average wholesale prices for purposes of medicaid reimbursement the counties overpaid their portion of the cost of pharmaceuticals the suits seek monetary and other relief including civil penalties and treble damages the three county suits have been transferred to the us district court for the district of massachusetts for pretrial proceedings along with several other suits to which lilly is not a party the suffolk county case is now the subject of a pending motion to dismiss and the rockland and westchester cases are stayed pending the resolution of that motion while we are vigorously defending these cases given their early procedural stage we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail we are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations including product liability and patent suits of a character we regard as normal to our business 13 while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions and investigations described above we believe that except as otherwise specifically noted above the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period

founded in indianapolis indiana in 1876 by colonel eli lilly we discover develop manufacture and sell products in one significant business segment—pharmaceutical products operations of our animal health business segment are not material to our financial statements we manufacture and distribute our products through owned or leased facilities in the united states puerto rico and 19 other countries our products are sold in approximately 150 countries most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative new pharmaceutical products we direct our research efforts primarily toward the search for products to diagnose prevent and treat human diseases we also conduct research to find products to treat diseases in animals and to increase the efficiency of animal food production products our products include  1  marketing we sell most of our products worldwide we adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local needs pharmaceuticals — united states in the united states we distribute pharmaceutical products principally through approximately 35 independent wholesale distributors our marketing policy is designed to assure that products and relevant medical information are immediately available to physicians pharmacies hospitals and appropriate health care professionals throughout the country three wholesale distributors in the united states — amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation — each accounted for between 16 and 17 percent of our worldwide consolidated net sales in 2002 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales we also sell pharmaceutical products directly to the united states government and other manufacturers but those sales are not material we promote our major pharmaceutical products in the united states through sales representatives who call upon physicians wholesalers hospitals managedcare organizations retail pharmacists and other health care professionals to support our sales representatives’ efforts we advertise in medical and drug journals distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians and exhibit at medical meetings in addition we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the united states and we maintain web sites with information about all our major products divisions of our sales force are dedicated to product lines or practice areas such as primary care neuroscience diabetes care critical care cardiovascular endocrinology and oncology we have entered into licensing arrangements under which other companies market certain products manufactured by us such as darvon sarafem axid keftab lorabid and permax large purchasers of pharmaceuticals such as managedcare groups and government and longterm care institutions account for a significant portion of total pharmaceutical purchases in the united states we have created special sales groups to service managedcare organizations government and longterm care institutions hospital contract administrators and certain retail pharmacies in response to competitive pressures we have entered into arrangements with a number of these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on one or more company products or other costsharing arrangements 2 pharmaceuticals — outside the united states outside the united states we promote our pharmaceutical products primarily through sales representatives while the products marketed vary from country to country neuroscience products constitute the largest single group in total sales distribution patterns vary from country to country in most countries we maintain our own sales and distribution organizations in some countries however we market our products through independent distributors animal health products our elanco animal health business unit employs field salespeople throughout the united states to market animal health products elanco also has an extensive sales force outside the united states elanco sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors raw materials and product supply most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source in addition three of our significant products are manufactured by others actos by takeda reopro by centocor and xigris by lonza biologics bulk product and dsm nv finished product if we were unable to obtain certain materials from present sources we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or in some cases implemented alternative processes the majority of our sales abroad are of products manufactured wholly or in part abroad however a principal source of active ingredients for those manufactured products continues to be our facilities in the united states we seek to design and operate our manufacturing facilities and maintain inventory in a way that will allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand however pharmaceutical production processes are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product consequently shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights overview intellectual property protection is in the aggregate material to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations we own have applied for or are licensed under a large number of patents both in the united states and in other countries relating to products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we have been granted would be found valid if challenged moreover patents relating to particular products uses formulations or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with our patented products 3 outside the united states the standard of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely while many countries have reasonably strong patent laws other countries currently provide little or no effective protection for inventions or other intellectual property rights under the traderelated aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto over 140 countries have now agreed to provide nondiscriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners however in many countries this agreement will not become fully effective for many years it is possible that changes to this agreement will be made in the future that will diminish or further delay its implementation in developing countries it is too soon to assess how much if at all we will benefit commercially from these changes when a product patent expires the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product this can result in very substantial reductions in sales of the formerly patented product particularly in the united states however in some cases the innovator company can obtain additional commercial benefits through manufacturing trade secrets laterexpiring patents on processes uses or formulations trademark use or marketing exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws our intellectual property portfolio we consider patent protection for certain products processes and uses—particularly that relating to zyprexa gemzar humalog evista actos reopro xigris and strattera—to be important to our operations for many of our products in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes formulations or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent united states compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective active ingredients in zyprexa 2011 humalog 2013 and reopro 2015 the gemzar compound patent in the us expires in 2010 but a use patent covering treatment of neoplasms with gemzar is in force until 2012 we hold a number of us patents covering evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention and treatment that we believe should provide us exclusivity in the united states until at least 2012 in the united states the actos compound patent extends beyond the duration of our copromotion agreement which is in force until 2006 xigris is a complex glycoprotein biologic product that is produced through recombinant dna technology xigris is not subject to the abbreviated new drug application process under the hatchwaxman law as described below in addition we hold patents on the dna materials certain uses manufacturing process and the glycoprotein itself we believe the intellectual property protection for xigris should provide us marketing exclusivity until 2015 for strattera we hold a use patent in the us for treating attention deficithyperactivity disorder the sole approved use of the drug this use patent expires in 2015 and we have applied for a patent term extension to 2016 worldwide we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as it is registered registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms patent challenges under the hatchwaxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly known as “hatchwaxman” made a complex set of changes to both patent and newdrugapproval laws in the united states before hatchwaxman no drug could be approved without providing the food and drug administration “fda” complete safety and efficacy studies ie  a complete new drug application “nda” hatchwaxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative medicines without such information by filing an abbreviated new drug application “anda” in an anda the 4 generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the ndaapproved drug — not safety and efficacy absent a successful patent challenge the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator’s patents expire however after the innovator has marketed its product for four years a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator’s nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known as a “paragraph iv certification” the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents if one or more of the ndalisted patents are successfully challenged the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a 180day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers in recent years generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals and we expect this trend to continue we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturers arising from their paragraph iv certifications on zyprexa evista and sarafem for more information on the zyprexa and evista patent litigation see part 1 item 3 legal proceedings proposals have been introduced in congress to amend various aspects of hatchwaxman in general the proposals appear to be principally designed to encourage more paragraph iv challenges to innovator patents and to limit an innovator’s ability to protect patents we cannot predict whether any changes will be made or what impact they would have on our business the fda has recently proposed regulations that represent a substantial reinterpretation of certain hatchwaxman provisions relating to the enforcement of drug patents the new fda interpretation would limit in certain circumstances the innovator company’s ability to secure a full court review of drug patent issues raised in a paragraph iv patent challenge by a generic drug company before fda approval would be given to a generic drug if the proposed fda regulations become effective we do not expect any material impact on the patent defense for any lilly product that is subject to a paragraph iv patent challenge nor do we expect any material impact on the way in which we conduct our operations under the hatchwaxman act competition our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of pharmaceutical chemical and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries important competitive factors include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service and research and development of new products and processes if competitors introduce new products and processes with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded product loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product in many countries outside the united states patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic or “knockoff” versions of our products to successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care 5 we believe our longterm competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative costeffective products that serve unmet medical needs together with our ability to manufacture the products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become outmoded from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors government regulation our operations are regulated extensively by the federal government to some extent by state governments and in varying degrees by foreign governments the federal food drug and cosmetic act other federal statutes and regulations various state statutes and regulations and laws and regulations of foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing approval production labeling distribution postmarket surveillance advertising dissemination of information and promotion of our products the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major world markets in addition our operations are subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations we anticipate that the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense and significant capital investment in the united states the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 requires us to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs in addition a model waiver program has been created administratively that allows states to expand the medicaid drug benefit to include lowincome medicare beneficiaries other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal state and local government entities that provide or pay for health care in most international markets we operate in an environment of governmentmandated cost containment programs which may include price controls discounts and rebates restrictions on physician prescription levels restrictions on reimbursement compulsory licenses and generic substitution in the us we expect branded pharmaceutical products to be subject to increasing pricing pressures our business could be significantly affected by the current national debate over medicare reform as well as by actions by individual states to reduce pharmaceutical costs for medicaid patients seniors and the uninsured and underinsured many proposals now being considered at the federal and state levels and in some cases implemented at the state level would result in government agencies demanding discounts and rebates from pharmaceutical companies that may expressly or implicitly create price controls on prescription drugs also some us lawmakers are considering proposals to legalize the wholesale importation of prescription drugs from canada a pricecontrolled jurisdiction a number of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their medicaid programs in 2000 the state of maine enacted legislation that would extend medicaid rebates beyond the current medicaid population this program has been upheld by a federal appeals court and is currently under review by the us supreme court while legal challenges to these and other state programs have been mounted it is unknown at this time if the courts will allow them to continue if upheld these types of programs could be adopted by other states international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations and there are many proposals for additional costcontainment measures including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 6 we cannot predict whether such proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments however we expect that pressures on pharmaceutical pricing will continue and likely intensify in the near term research and development our commitment to research and development dates back more than 100 years our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery and development of most of the products we offer today we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our longterm competitiveness at the end of 2002 we employed approximately 8325 people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities including a substantial number of physicians scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and highly skilled technical personnel our research and development expenses were 202 billion in 2000 224 billion in 2001 and 215 billion in 2002 we concentrate our pharmaceutical research and development efforts in five therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases endocrine diseases including diabetes and osteoporosis cancer cardiovascular diseases and inflammation however we remain opportunistic selectively pursuing promising leads in other therapeutic areas we are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving recombinant dna proteins and genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of diseasecausing genes and their cellular function in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients we also conduct extensive research in the animal sciences including animal nutrition and physiology and veterinary medicine to supplement our internal efforts we collaborate with independent research organizations including educational institutions and researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities we use the services of physicians hospitals medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of new products we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts these investments can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements joint ventures and acquisitions drug development is timeconsuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval typically takes 1015 years or longer drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process and even latestage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval we believe our investments in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the number of new pharmaceutical compounds and indications we have in all stages of development among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for male erectile dysfunction depression various cancers stress urinary incontinence diabetes and its complications and anxiety disorder further we are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our important currently marketed products such as zyprexa gemzar reopro and evista quality assurance our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from a total 7 commitment to quality in all parts of our operations including research and development purchasing facilities planning manufacturing and distribution we have implemented qualityassurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients equipment facilities manufacturing methods packaging materials and labeling we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses microbiological testing testing in animals or a combination additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate qualityassurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company subsidiaries and affiliates and thirdparty suppliers as a result of preapproval plant inspections for zyprexa intramuscular and forteo in early 2001 the fda informed us of a number of observations and issued a warning letter regarding adherence to current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” regulations in response we have been implementing comprehensive companywide improvements in our manufacturing operations in november 2001 following a reinspection of the manufacturing facilities for zyprexa intramuscular and forteo the fda noted additional observations primarily relating to computer system validation manufacturing process reviews and data handling in the spring of 2002 as part of cgmp inspection requirements and preapproval inspections related to our product pipeline the fda conducted a comprehensive review of eight of our global manufacturing sites and issued reports summarizing the investigators’ findings fifty observations were noted in the combined inspection reports for the indianapolis facilities the findings primarily related to overly complex quality processes insufficient technical expertise and oversight and our need to improve our ability to identify the root cause of manufacturing deviations the number of observations for the inspections outside indianapolis ranged from zero to a maximum of 16 at one site two subsequent inspections in puerto rico and indianapolis resulted in no observations at either site in the fall of 2002 we provided the fda with a comprehensive plan to upgrade our manufacturing and quality operations particularly at our indianapolis facilities we are moving vigorously to implement the plan and are engaged in discussions with the agency on our plan and its ongoing implementation we are preparing for inspections in two of our indianapolis facilities although the fda has not yet cleared all our manufacturing operations the agency did approve strattera and forteo in november 2002 approval of zyprexa intramuscular and cymbalta™ a new antidepressant will depend on resolution of manufacturing issues in relevant indianapolis facilities to the fda’s satisfaction the approval of cialis™ a treatment for erectile dysfunction is not expected to be affected since this product is manufactured outside indianapolis the timeline for resolution of these issues is difficult to predict a manufacturer subject to a warning letter that fails to correct cgmp deficiencies to the agency’s satisfaction could be subject to interruption of production recalls seizures fines and other penalties executive officers of the company the following table sets

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net sales changes from year to year this is due to several factors including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers and the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals upon patent expirations in addition margins vary for our different products due to various factors including differences in the cost to manufacture and market the products the value of the products to the marketplace and government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement 9 financial information relating to foreign and domestic

 item 3 legal proceedings zyprexa patent litigation in february 2001 we were notified that zenith goldline pharmaceuticals inc had submitted an abbreviated new drug application “anda” with the us fda seeking permission to market a generic version of zyprexa in various dosage forms several years prior to the expiration of our us patents for the product alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed on april 2 2001 we filed suit against zenith in federal district court in indianapolis seeking a ruling that zenith’s challenge to the us compound patent expiring in 2011 is without merit in may 2001 we were notified that dr reddy’s laboratories ltd had also filed an anda covering two dosage forms alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed on june 26 2001 we filed a similar patent infringement suit against reddy in federal district court in indianapolis thereafter we were notified that reddy had filed an anda for additional dosage forms and in february 2002 we filed an infringement suit in the same court based on reddy’s additional anda we received notice in august 2002 of a similar anda filing by teva pharmaceuticals and in september 2002 we filed suit against teva in the same court finally in february 2003 we received notice that reddy had filed an anda on the zydis® formulation of zyprexa and in march 2003 we filed suit against reddy in the same court the cases are consolidated and are in the discovery stage trial is currently scheduled to begin on january 26 2004 we believe that the generic manufacturers’ claims are without merit and we expect to prevail in this litigation however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position other patent litigation in october 2002 we were notified that barr laboratories inc had submitted an anda with the us fda seeking permission to market a generic version of evista several years prior to the expiration of our us patents covering the product alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed on november 26 2002 we filed suit against barr in federal district court in indianapolis seeking a ruling that barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the method of use and pharmaceutical form expiring from 2012 to 2017 are without merit the case is in discovery with a trial date currently scheduled for february 2005 while we believe that barr’s claims are without merit and expect to prevail it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and financial position in october 2002 pfizer inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court in delaware against us lilly icos llc and icos corporation alleging that the proposed marketing of cialis for erectile dysfunction would infringe its newly issued methodofuse patent previously pfizer’s corresponding european methodofuse patent was held invalid in the first stage of an opposition proceeding in the european patent office pfizer is now appealing that decision in addition the uk counterpart to this patent has been held invalid by the uk court of appeal the us case is in the preliminary stages we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and expect to prevail however it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will prevail product liability litigation we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability litigation lawsuits in the united states involving primarily diethylstilbestrol “des” and thimerosal in approximately 105 actions including several with multiple claimants plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who ingested des during pregnancy 11 in late february 2003 a law firm in san francisco california issued a press release claiming that it has filed “several” lawsuits and is in the process of filing “numerous” other suits against the company on behalf of plaintiffs who claim that they suffered various illnesses as a result of administration of zyprexa we intend to vigorously defend all such suits as of march 18 2003 only one suit had been served on us we have been named as a defendant in over 200 actions in the us including several that purport to be class actions brought in various state courts and federal district courts on behalf of children with autism or other neurological disorders who received childhood vaccines manufactured by other companies that contained thimerosal a generic preservative used in certain vaccines in the us from the 1930’s until approximately 2000 we discovered and developed thimerosal in the 1920’s we have been named in the suits even though we discontinued manufacturing the raw material used to preserve vaccines in 1974 and discontinued selling it in the united states to vaccine manufacturers in 1992 the lawsuits typically name the vaccine manufacturers lilly and other distributors of thimerosal and allege that the children’s exposure to thimerosalcontaining vaccines caused their autism or other neurological disorders we strongly deny any liability in these cases there is no scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between thimerosalcontaining vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders in addition we believe the cases should not be prosecuted in the courts in which they have been brought because the underlying claims are subject to the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 implemented in 1988 the act established a mandatory federally administered nofault claims process for individuals who allege that they were harmed by the administration of childhood vaccines under the act claims must first be brought before the us court of claims for an award determination under the compensation guidelines established pursuant to the act claimants who are unsatisfied with their awards under the act may reject the award and seek traditional judicial remedies other matters in july 2002 we received a grand jury subpoena for documents from the office of consumer litigation department of justice related to our marketing of evista the investigation centers on our communications with physicians regarding existing clinical data assessing the potential for evista in reducing the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease it has been alleged that certain of these communications with physicians regarding these data constituted unlawful promotion of evista for indications that are not approved by the fda we are in the process of responding to the subpoena we have established a number of policies and procedures designed to ensure that these types of communications with respect to clinical data comply with all promotional laws and regulations however it is possible that criminal penalties could be sought in this matter in march 1996 the us federal trade commission “ftc” commenced a nonpublic antitrust investigation focusing on the pharmaceutical industry practice of providing discounts or rebates to managedcare organizations and certain other purchasers we have responded to two subpoenas from the ftc requesting production of certain documents and other discovery responses we believe that all of our actions have been lawful and proper and are cooperating with the investigation in march 2001 we received a subpoena issued at the request of the commonwealth’s attorney for the commonwealth of massachusetts for production of documents related to pricing and medicaid reimbursement of our products in massachusetts we believe that we are not the only pharmaceutical company to receive such a request we are cooperating with the inquiry and we believe that all of our practices have been lawful and proper we were named as a defendant along with many other pharmaceutical manufacturers in lawsuits in federal district court for the district of massachusetts served on us in december 2001 and in federal district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania served on us in may 2002 the suits purported to be nationwide class actions on behalf of consumers of certain prescription drugs claiming in general that 12 as a result of alleged improprieties in the calculation and reporting of average wholesale prices for purposes of medicare reimbursement consumers overpaid their portion of the cost of the drugs the two suits were thereafter consolidated as part of a multidistrict litigation “mdl” in the district of massachusetts in re pharmaceutical industry average wholesale price litigation mdl no 1456 in september 2002 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated master complaint in the mdl and did not name us as a defendant thus we are no longer a party to the mdl action we have also been named as a defendant along with many other manufacturers in similar suits brought in state courts in montana and nevada by the attorneys general of those two states the suits seek damages on behalf of both the respective states as health care payers and consumers of certain prescription drugs in those states the montana suit was brought in state court in montana in february 2002 and the nevada suit was brought in a nevada state court in march 2002 in january 2003 a similar suit was filed against us and several other pharmaceutical manufacturers by the local government of suffolk county new york in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york we believe that all of our practices in this regard have been lawful and proper and that these suits are without merit however it is impossible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail we are also a defendant in other litigation and investigations including product liability and patent suits of a character we regard as normal to our business while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions and investigations pending against us we believe that except as noted above with respect to the zyprexa and evista patent litigation the costs associated with all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in
