we also rely on certain thirdparty vendors to distribute our data to clients while some of our vendors generate revenue in connection with distributing our data others do not derive a direct financial benefit should any of our key vendors refuse to distribute our data for any reason or require that we pay them new or additional fees in connection with the distribution of our data we would need to find alternative ways to distribute our data or lose revenue or profitability for certain products which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our products and services support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets products or services we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing or other quality assurance practices use of our products or services as part of the investment process 

 

creates the risk that our clients the parties whose assets are managed by our clients  investors in investment products linked to our indexes the companies that we rate or assess in our esg solutions or the shareholders of those companies may pursue claims against us based on even a small error in our data calculations methodologies or analysis or a malfunction or failure in our systems products or services 

errors or defects can exist at any point in a product’s lifecycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or services or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of and updates to our existing products or services despite internal testing and in some cases testing or use by clients our products or services may contain errors in our data calculations methodologies or analysis including serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release or deliver a product or service or publish a methodology or analysis we might have to suspend or delay the product or service release or delivery for an extended period of time while we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our products or services or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements or corrections to address such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to do so if undetected errors exist in our products or services or if our products or services fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our brand or reputation significantly increased costs lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products or services license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors defects or malfunctions the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

while we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our liability from claims brought by our clients or third parties relating to our products or services these provisions could be invalidated or fail to adequately limit our liability in addition clients also increasingly require us to provide contractual assurances regarding our risk management and security practices or policies and many of our clients in the financial services sector are subject to regulations and requirements to adopt risk management processes to oversee their thirdparty relationships contractual disputes could result in the provision of credits adverse monetary judgments and other penalties and damages any such claims brought against us even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would require attention of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business financial condition or results of operations

the covid19 pandemic or other widespread health crises could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant economic disruption including volatility in the global equity markets our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control including the imposition in many jurisdictions of a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees and vendors to limit the spread of covid19 even though some initial measures have been relaxed certain restrictions have been reinstated as new variants of covid19 have emerged and other measures may be put back into place or increased if the spread of the covid19 pandemic continues or increases in the future while we were not materially impacted in 2021 due to ongoing uncertainty related to the duration magnitude and impact of the covid19 pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic its potential effects on our business are uncertain and difficult to predict but may include 







 













these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if the covid19 pandemic is sustained or prolonged these effects could be exacerbated additionally many of the other risk factors described in this item may be exacerbated or the likelihood of such risks materializing may be increased by global widespread health crises such as the covid19 pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic and responses to the pandemic

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our attempts to mitigate any negative effects of this global pandemic on our business including implementing our business continuity plans and processes transitioning to remote and flexiblework models globally proactively reducing costs intended to allow us to protect against further downside revenue risk and investing in additional initiatives to support our longterm growth while also focusing on maintaining liquidity and capital structure flexibility

we closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside of our control including the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the emergence spread and severity of new variants of covid19 the development availability distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments the imposition of protective public safety measures including vaccine and testing mandates and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy including financial markets

this situation is changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider significant risks to our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business financial condition or results of operations may be negatively impacted 

 

msci is exposed to potential reputational and credibility concerns

 

to the extent that any of msci’s operating segments or product lines or msci as a whole suffers a reputational or other loss in credibility it could have a material adverse impact on msci’s business real or perceived factors that may have already affected credibility or which could potentially have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the editorial independence of our index composition and esg rating and assessment processes and decisions the influence of third parties including governments and large investors or asset owners on our editorial decisions the performance of companies relative to their esg ratings index inclusion risk characteristics or other msci content or analytics the timing and nature of changes to our indexes or esg ratings and assessments disagreement with our methodologies or models including for calculating indexes valueatrisk and other risk measures esg ratings and assessments data information and analysis the accuracy and completeness of our data views expressed by the media politicians other government officials or representatives regulators or other third parties regarding our company or our industry or our role in the investment process our own sustainability and corporate responsibility policies or practices including as a result of i failure to meet publicly disclosed esg and climaterelated targets or goals or ii misalignment with evolving market standards or the methodologies and standards used in our products and esg ratings and the impact of political tensions relating to countries industries companies or issues relevant to our products and services such as the inclusion of certain chinese companies in our indexes or the focus on sustainable investing and climate considerations in our offerings in some cases our esg and climate offerings such as our company esg ratings and our netzero tracker may insert msci into a public spotlight or debate regarding the environment social concerns or corporate responsibility in addition our position as a leading source of esg research ratings data and 

 

assessments may at times become contentious or controversial and lead to disputes with companies or investors or other interested stakeholders and create negative media or regulatory attention  errors and other actions by msci competitor s could also damage the reputation of the industries that we operate in and therefore  harm the reputation of the company or certain of our products  in addition we believe that msci’s corporate culture and reputation contribute to our ability to attract and retain talent and reputational damage could negatively affect both our hiring and employee retention damage to our reputation  brand or credibility could have a material adverse impact on msci’s business financial condition or results of operations  

client risks 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets under management or total expense ratio of an indexed investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the us our clients including our largest clients may seek for a variety of reasons to negotiate to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant product’s total expense ratio “ter” additionally competition is intense among our clients that offer or manage indexed investment products including etfs and low fees are one of the competitive differentiators where an investment product’s ter determines our fees a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues additionally our clients including our largest clients may seek to renegotiate existing assetbased fee models with the objective of achieving lower fees either on a rate basis or in aggregate which may have a negative impact on our operating revenues

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexed investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect at any time to cease offering the investment product or switch to using a nonmsci index clients that license our indexes to serve as the basis for listed futures and options contracts might also discontinue such contracts additionally we have a differentiated licensing strategy for our indexes and from time to time experience faster growth from lower fee products resulting in a lower average assetbased fee percentage from indexed investment products while we aim to maximize the price and volume tradeoff over the longterm there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in assets in indexed investment products with lowerthanaverage fees not sufficiently offset by growth in assets in indexed investment products with higherthanaverage fees our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations finally to the extent that multiple investment products are based on the same index i assets under management in one product could shift to products that pay msci lower fee levels ii the products could compete for the same assets such that none of the products becomes large enough to be successful or sustained or iii the failure or discontinuance of one product  eg  derivatives used for hedging could have a detrimental effect on the use of the other products  eg  etfs

cancellations or reductions by any of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

a material portion of our revenues is concentrated in some of our largest customers for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 127 of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 blackrock accounted for 110 of our total revenues our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients sell additional services to existing clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing licenses failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those licenses our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us for example a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage and others have invested in direct indexing strategies allowing investors to purchase individual stocks making up an index rather than investing in a fund or etf similarly some of our clients who currently license our risk or esg and climate data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk or embed esg and climate considerations into their investment processes making our products or services unnecessary for them a growing number of asset managers and investment banks in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services or acting together with an industry group or 

 

association have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs structured products or overthecounter derivatives to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products or services may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

technology risks 

any failures disruptions instability or vulnerabilities in our information technology architecture platforms vendors and service providers production and delivery systems software code internal network the internet or other systems or applications may disrupt our operations cause our products to be unavailable or fail and impose delays or additional costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential and result in reputational and other harm and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and platforms and their components including our data centers cloud providers and other vendors and service providers production and delivery systems as well the internet to create and deliver our products and service our clients our employees also depend on these systems platforms and providers for internal use heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures human error terrorist or other attacks affecting systems or sites where we are located climate or weather related events  eg  hurricanes floods or other natural disasters another outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease power loss telecommunications failures technical breakdowns internet failures or malicious software could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time or impact the availability of personnel our ability to effectively use the internet including our remote work force’s ability to access the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation 

disruptions failures or slowdowns that could occur with respect to our operations including to our information technology systems and platforms our electronic delivery systems or the internet could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation and negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients including delivering managed services or delivering realtime index data to the extent we grow through acquisitions newly acquired businesses may not have invested in technological infrastructure and disaster recovery to the same extent as we have as their systems are integrated into ours a vulnerability could be introduced which could impact our platforms across the company 

there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend against such disruptions or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans or those of our thirdparty service providers including cloud providers will be effective in mitigating the risks and associated costs which could be exacerbated by our shift to an increasingly remote working environment and which could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of data could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

many of our products as well as our internal systems and processes involve the collection retrieval processing storage and transmission of proprietary third party and client confidential information we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we rely on a complex system of internal processes and it controls along with policies procedures and training to protect this information including sensitive client data such as material nonpublic information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized access or disclosure in addition we believe that when we change the composition of our indexes in some cases the changes can have an indirect effect on the prices of constituent securities and on certain indexed investment products as a result of trading activity related to tracking our indexes as the usage and types of uses of our esg ratings increase the ratings and changes to the ratings in some cases could also potentially have an impact on the companies that we rate the price of their securities and the price of other securities that reference their securities 

if our internal processes confidentiality policies conflict of interest policies or information barrier procedures fail or are insufficient including as a result of human error or manual processes system error or other failure or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of data including material nonpublic or other confidential information  eg  certain index composition data or esg rating data our brand and reputation may suffer and we may become subject to litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other penalties leading to a loss of client confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

successful cyberattacks and the failure of cybersecurity plans systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of data and information and on those of our thirdparty vendors we and our vendors are subject to cyber risks including cyberattacks such as phishing scams hacking tampering intrusions viruses ransomware malware and denialofservice attacks in some cases these risks are heightened when employees are working remotely our and our vendors’ use of mobile and cloud technologies may also increase our risk for such threats the company may be exposed to more targeted and more sophisticated cyberattacks aimed at accessing certain information on our systems because of our role or prominence in the global marketplace including client portfolio data the composition of our indexes and msci esg research ratings of corporate issuers any such threats may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or our vendors’ products or services networks systems websites applications data or data processing or may otherwise compromise the availability confidentiality or integrity of data or information in our possession while the company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material the company has experienced cyberattacks of varying degrees in the past including denialofservice attacks and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future 

our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed cyberattacks security breaches or thirdparty reports of perceived security vulnerability to the company’s systems even if no breach has occurred could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other penalties lead to loss of client confidence which would harm our ability to retain clients and gain new ones and lead to financial losses any of the foregoing could lead to unexpected or higher than estimated costs we may also incur additional costs as a result of increasing and refining our internal processes and it controls and policies and procedures related to security processing integrity and confidentiality or privacy

migration of our applications systems processes and infrastructure to new technologies cloud providers data centers processes platforms or applications could result in unanticipated failures interruptions or delays in the performance and delivery of our products services and client support such incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

in the past we have experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain products after we migrated applications and infrastructure to new data centers while we have taken steps to mitigate such interruptions and delays we cannot provide assurance that they will not occur again in the future as part of migration efforts to new technologies applications or processes  eg  cloud migration even after extensive testing of new systems processes applications and hardware or if we experience significant growth of our customer base or increases in the number of products or services or in the speed at which we are required to provide products and services such disruptions may result in cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues or in cost increases relating to our use of power and data storage after adopting new technologies applications and processes such as cloud computing virtualization and agile software development we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products services and client support we may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from such disruptions accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform cloud providers data centers production and delivery systems applications processes or the internet could negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients damage our brand and reputation and result in litigation which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our use of open source code could introduce security vulnerabilities impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or services or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or services or keep them confidential

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products and internal systems the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims the quality of the code or the security of the code some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary code with open source code and distribute it in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage additionally the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts therefore we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible to make generally available portions of our proprietary code to reengineer our products or systems to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely or costeffective basis or to take other remedial action that 

 

could divert resources away from our development efforts any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations  

 

strategy and growth risks 

our business may be affected by changes in the global capital markets including adverse equity market conditions volatility in the financial markets and evolving investment trends such changes could decrease the use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our business is impacted by economic conditions and volatility in the global capital markets our clients use our products for a variety of purposes including benchmarking performance attribution portfolio construction and risk management and to support investment strategies including esg climate factor thematic private asset and mac investing volatile capital markets may impact whether how where and when investors choose to invest for example between developed or emerging markets us or nonus markets as well as whether to adopt different investment strategies 

a portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexed investment products these fees are primarily based on a client’s assets under management or trading volumes the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues 

additionally an increasing portion of our revenues comes from products and services that relate to certain investment trends such as esg and climate factor thematic private asset and mac investing a decline in the equity markets or movement away from such investment trends could decrease demand for our related products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

competition exists across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product or service some competitors may offer price incentives or different pricing structures that are more attractive to clients the competitive landscape may also experience consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions joint ventures or strategic partnerships which result in a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies

barriers to entry may be low or declining in many of the markets for our products and services including for singlepurpose product companies which could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example more brokerdealers data suppliers credit rating agencies or other market participants or vendors could begin developing their own content such as proprietary risk analytics esg and climate data or indexes recent developments including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information through internet sources or other lowcost delivery systems advances in cloud computing increased use of open source code the ability of machine learning and other artificial intelligence systems to process and organize large data sets as well as client development of proprietary applications in specific areas have further reduced barriers to entry in some cases 

we may experience pressures to reduce our fees on account of financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic or market conditions including uncertainty regarding the duration and longterm economic and societal consequences of the covid19 pandemic which may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer providers by consolidating with other clients or by selfsourcing certain of their information and analytical needs accordingly competitive and market pressures may result in fewer clients or reduced sales including as a result of client closures and consolidations price reductions prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

to remain competitive we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage product transitions and integrations 

to remain competitive we must continually introduce new products and services enhance existing products and services including through integration of products and services within msci and with thirdparty platforms and effectively generate customer demand for new and enhanced products and services we may not be successful in developing introducing implementing marketing pricing launching or licensing new products or enhancements on a timely or costeffective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and systems any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or industry standards or achieve market acceptance 

the process of developing and enhancing our products and services is complex and may become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and customer expectations in addition our reputation could be harmed if we are perceived as not innovating rapidly enough to meet the changing needs of investors or their advisors we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in new or enhanced products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate adequate revenues from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also present execution risks and challenges and could lead to price reductions or other concessions if we are unable to effectively manage the development of new or enhanced products and services we may not be able to remain competitive and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our global operations and any future expansions may continue to place significant strain on our management and other resources as well as subject us to additional and in some cases unanticipated risks and costs in connection with political economic legal operational and other issues resulting from our increased global footprint which could materially adversely impact our businesses 

our global operations and any future expansion are expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources whether we expand organically or by way of acquisition there can be no assurance that we will effectively attract engage and retain additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees develop effective leadership in all our locations expand our physical facilities and information technology legal and compliance infrastructure integrate acquired businesses or otherwise adequately manage expansion additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive 

our global operations also expose us to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments legal uncertainty broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations the majority of our employees are located in offices outside of the us and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate additionally public health epidemics impacting the global economy and our employees such as the worldwide covid19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult or costly for us to determine and remain compliant with the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally

demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world particularly in emerging market locations where risk management and esg and climate integration practices are often not fully developed in addition the data required to model local securities in some emerging markets might be difficult to source and local investment product nuances may be difficult or costly to model if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and 

 

services in some locations outside of the us there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business globally could damage our brand and reputation result in increased costs and litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

legal and regulatory risks 

failure to comply with regulations or the introduction of new regulations or changes to existing regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with any applicable laws rules orders regulations or other requirements could subject us to litigation regulatory actions sanctions fines or other penalties as well as damage our brand and reputation the financial services industry within which we and many of our clients operate is subject to extensive laws rules and regulations at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly these laws rules and regulations are complex evolve frequently and sometimes quickly and unexpectedly and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect our business and our clients’ businesses uncertainty caused by political change globally heightens regulatory uncertainty additionally we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws rules or regulations in various jurisdictions which could individually or in the aggregate result in materially higher compliance costs to us it is possible that laws rules or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license and price our products and services or could impose additional costs on us changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could limit our clients’ ability to use our products and services or could otherwise impact our clients’ demand for our products and services as such to the extent that our clients become subject to certain laws rules or regulations we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services to the extent that we rely on our clients and vendors to provide data for our products and services and certain laws rules or regulations impact our clients’ and vendors’ ability or willingness to provide that data to us or regulate the fees for which such data can be provided our ability to continue to produce our products and services or the related costs could be negatively impacted the regulations and regulatory developments that most significantly impact us are described below



the euuk trade and cooperation agreement and the mou provide some clarity regarding the future relationship between the uk and the eu including some detailed matters of trade and cooperation but there remain uncertainties related to brexit and the new relationship between the uk and eu that will continue to be developed and defined as well as uncertainties related to the wider trading legal regulatory tax and labor environments and the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients because we have significant operations in the eu and certain members of our senior management team are based in the uk any of these uncertainties could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases affect our ability to do business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations



 

for example the benchmark industry is subject to regulations in the eu  such as regulation eu 20161011 as amended which is also applicable in the uk as it forms part of uk domestic law by virtue of the european union withdrawal act 2018 as amended  as well as increased scrutiny and potential new or increased regulation in various other jurisdictions additionally the european securities and markets authority “esma” issues guidance from time to time regarding interpretations of the eu benchmark regulation such as regulation eu 20161011 as amended and regulation eu no 6002014   the esma guidelines on etfs and other ucits issues limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” recommends that benchmark administrators on a voluntary basis publicly disclose whether they comply with the principles for financial benchmarks published by iosco other jurisdictions have also indicated they may consider potential benchmark regulation or conduct reviews of the benchmark industry for instance the uk fca has announced that it will conduct a market study into how competition is working in the markets for benchmarks and indices the heightened attention and scrutiny on benchmarks and index providers by regulators policymakers and the media in the eu the us and other jurisdictions around the world could result in negative publicity or comments about the role or influence of our company or the index industry generally which could harm our reputation and credibility 

further laws rules regulations and orders affecting users of our indexes can have an indirect impact on our indexes including their construction and composition such as sanctions that prohibit users of our indexes from investing or transacting in securities included in our indexes





 

in some instances in connection with the provision of data and services we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject for example a us executive order prohibiting many of our clients from transacting in the securities of certain chinese companies resulted in our decision to remove these companies from relevant indexes in order to support our clients’ needs that our indexes meet their objective to be replicable in investment portfolios to the 

 

extent that our clients are subject to increased regulation we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products 

additionally there has been increased attention on and scrutiny of index and esg rating providers by politicians regulators policymakers and the media which could create negative publicity that could harm our reputation or credibility as well as result in new or additional regulation that could increase our costs and have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations for example iosco has asked regulators to consider focusing more attention on the use of esg ratings and data products and esg ratings and data products providers that may be subject to their jurisdiction and esma has called for entities issuing esg ratings and assessments to be registered and supervised these or similar regulatory regimes could impose significant compliance burdens and costs on our esg and climate products and services furthermore regulation in multiple jurisdictions may be inconsistent which could create implementation challenges and result in inadvertent noncompliance

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon their intellectual property rights which in each case could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets patents copyrights and trademark rights laws regarding unfair competition and the misappropriation of intellectual property as well as technical measures and contractual protections such as nondisclosure obligations to protect our products and services despite our best efforts we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property are adequate to prevent unauthorized use misappropriation distribution or theft of our intellectual property 

intellectual property laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change or varying interpretations at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights the enforceability of intellectual property rights and obligations under our agreements as well as the availability of remedies in the event of a breach may vary due to the different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm us our brand or reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

there is no guarantee that any intellectual property rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights furthermore our competitors may independently develop and protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential information or to take the necessary steps to enforce our rights in addition our products and services or thirdparty products that we provide to our clients could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others

pursuing intellectual property claims to preserve our intellectual property rights or responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time and result in costly litigation or delays and there is no guarantee that we will be successful from time to time we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights and the number of these claims may grow these intellectual property claims would likely be costly to defend and could require us to pay damages limit our future use of certain technologies harm our brand and reputation significantly increase our costs and prevent us from offering some services or products we may need to settle such claims on unfavorable terms pay damages stop providing or using the affected products or services or enter into royalty or licensing agreements which may include terms that are not commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there have been a number of lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions including in the us and germany regarding whether issuers of indexed investment products are required to obtain a license from the index owner or whether issuers may issue investment products based on publicly available indexlevel data without obtaining permission from or making payment to the index owner the outcome of these cases depends on a number of factors including the governing law the amount of information about the index available without a license and the other 

 

particular facts and circumstances of the cases in some instances the results have been unfavorable to the index owner if courts or regulators or other governmental bodies in relevant jurisdictions determine that a license is not required to issue investment products linked to indexes this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations it might also lead to changes in current industry practices such that we would no longer make our index level data publicly available such as via our website or news media on a timely basis 

some of our products and services help our clients to meet their regulatory requirements changes to regulatory requirements may obviate the need for these products or services or may cause us to invest in enhancing the products or services to help our clients meet the new regulatory requirements

financial risks 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded additionally the value of assets in indexed investment products can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we manage certain portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes any derivative financial instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations

in addition brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase or decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility

for an overview of our current outstanding indebtedness and history of our debt offerings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below although we believe that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to pay our obligations as they mature we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity if we are unable to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements however limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 

we may need or want to refinance our existing debt or incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so we may be subject to less favorable terms the risks related to our level of indebtedness could also intensify including by making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness 

furthermore the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit among other things our and our existing and future subsidiaries’ financial flexibility if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default that in some cases if continuing could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under the credit agreement dated as of november 20 2014 by and among the company the guarantors party 

 

thereto jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and the lenders from time to time party thereto as amended supplemented modified or amended and restated from time to time as amended the “ revolving credit facility ” 

in 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 the administrator for libor announced on march 5 2021 that it will permanently cease to publish most libor settings beginning on january 1 2022 and cease to publish the overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and 12month usd libor settings on july 1 2023 accordingly the fca has stated that is does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to libor after such respective dates until such time however fca panel banks have agreed to continue to support libor the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is recommending replacing usd libor with the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities it is unknown whether sofr will attain market acceptance as replacement for libor and because sofr differs fundamentally from libor there is no assurance that sofr will perform in the same way as libor would have performed at any time and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for libor at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments may have on any floating rate debt instruments including borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility pursuant to the credit agreement amendment that became effective on march 29 2021 we updated the libor succession provisions in our revolving credit facility to contemplate a mechanism for replacing libor with a new benchmark rate without an amendment to the terms of the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility since the conditions for the implementation of this mechanism have not yet been triggered we cannot determine with certainty what such replacement rate would be as a result we cannot reasonably predict the potential effect of a discontinuation or replacement of libor other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition if we were to incur any variable rate indebtedness under our revolving credit facility we would be subject to interest rate risk generally which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly

a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition

our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt our outstanding debt under the senior notes currently has noninvestment grade ratings any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by any of the agencies if in the agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant such future circumstances include but are not limited to adverse changes to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage any such downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain

in addition our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating including obligations to make repurchase offers to the noteholders of our senior notes if we experience one of the specified kinds of changes in control and related lowering of our credit ratings as detailed in the indentures governing our senior notes

any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms accordingly actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook could result in damage to our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt

we may have exposure to tax liabilities in various jurisdictions future changes in tax law could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome or indirect taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations 

 

where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate 

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities we may be subject to additional tax liabilities as the jurisdictions in which we do business globally are increasingly focused on digital taxes and the treatment of remote workforces although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs

general risks 

our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the fullyear financial guidance or longterm targets that we provide publicly

we provide certain fullyear financial guidance and longterm targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results if we fail to meet the fullyear financial guidance or achieve the longterm targets that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance or targets the market value of our common stock or other securities could be adversely affected

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we have experienced significant revenue and earnings growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past if we experience higher than expected operating costs including increased compensation costs regulatory compliance costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion market data costs software license costs communication costs travel costs application development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure cloud usage and other it costs and we cannot adjust to these costs our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected additionally there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development selling and marketing efforts or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past 

we may be exposed to liabilities as a result of failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our global operations including anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to complex laws and regulations that are applicable to our global operations such as laws and regulations governing economic and trade sanctions tariffs embargoes antiboycott restrictions and anticorruption and other similar laws and regulations any determination that we have violated these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

in particular we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or benefits or offers of payments or benefits to foreign governments and their officials and in some cases to employees of a business for the purpose of directing obtaining or retaining business we conduct business in countries and regions that are less developed than the us and in some cases are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 

we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these types of practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than fully effective and 

 

our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory fines sanctions damages or other penalties or costs violations of any of these laws including the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties damage our brand and reputation and subject us to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize expected returns and synergies from acquisitions or strategic partnerships or investments or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions or strategic partnerships or investments our financial results may be materially adversely affected

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions strategic partnerships and investments despite our best efforts to continue pursuing such transactions there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable strategic partners investment opportunities or attractive acquisition candidates at acceptable terms in addition we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so may be made more difficult by the terms of our existing indebtedness

our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions including our recent acquisition of rca strategic partnerships and investments depends in part upon our ability to effectively leverage or integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate or that our strategic partnerships and investments will advance the longterm growth strategy of our company our past and future acquisitions strategic partnerships and investments may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities including the potential to disrupt our operations additionally strategic partnerships may increase our reliance on third parties which may result in future disruptions if those partnerships are unsuccessful or discontinued or the content or level of support provided by strategic partners is diminished

if we experience a high level of acquisition strategic partnership or investmentrelated activity within a limited period of time the probability that certain of these risks would occur would likely increase in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses or assets executing strategic partnerships or investments or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our brand or reputation could suffer and our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

our goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income

we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable these impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired

if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge skills experience and abilities of our employees accordingly we believe the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees and our inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we compete for key employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work if our compensation programs do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive or if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our 

 

products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our clients and achieve business objectives may suffer 

we cannot provide any guaranty that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program

the timing price and volume of repurchases of shares of our common stock will be based on market conditions relevant securities laws and other factors the stock repurchases may be made from time to time through one or more open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions including without limitation accelerated share repurchase transactions trading plans or derivative transactions or otherwise

share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital return strategy which we fund with free operating cash flow and borrowings however we are not required to make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any set dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice the reduction or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our shares as a result any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources

key financial and operating metrics and drivers

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue and profit growth including results accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” as well as nongaap measures for the company as a whole and by operating segment

we present revenues disaggregated by types and by segments which represent our major product lines we also review expenses by activity which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed in addition we utilize operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and retention rate to manage and assess performance and to provide deeper insights into the recurring portion of our business

in the discussion that follows we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period while operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes assetbased fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the underlying aum which is the primary component of assetbased fees is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations approximately threefifths of the aum is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and accordingly any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currencyadjusted variances

revenues

our revenues are presented by type and by reportable segment for each reportable segment we present revenues disaggregated by the nature of the revenues which are recurring subscriptions assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues

 

recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date 

assetbased fees represent fees earned that are variable in nature as they are calculated based on the aum linked to our indexes assetbased fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes which are primarily based on trading volumes

nonrecurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts nonrecurring revenues primarily include revenues from licenses of historical data indexed derivative financial products certain implementation services and other special client requests which are generally recognized at a point in time but may also be recognized over the license period 

operating expenses

we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories













costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or when not directly attributable an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved cost of revenues selling and marketing rd and ga all include both compensation as well as noncompensation related expenses

cost of revenues

cost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs including data center cloud service platform and infrastructure costs costs to acquire produce and maintain market data information costs of research to support and maintain existing products costs of product management teams costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources finance and legal costs 

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams as well as costs incurred in other departments associated with acquiring new business including product management research technology and sales operations

research and development

rd expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and the costs to develop new or enhanced technologies and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development research product management project management and the technology support directly associated with these activities

general and administrative

ga expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations human resources office of the ceo legal corporate technology corporate development impairment charges associated with right of use assets and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed but are instead allocated to a product or service

 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definitelived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and capitalization of internally developed software projects intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships proprietary data trademarks and trade names and technology and software we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives we have no indefinitelived intangible assets

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of computer and related equipment leasehold improvements software and furniture and fixtures over the estimated useful life of the assets

other expense income net

other expense income net consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness including losses on early extinguishment of debt income and losses associated with our equity method investment foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments as well as other nonoperating income and expense items that may arise from time to time

nongaap financial measures

adjusted ebitda

“adjusted ebitda” a nongaap measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as net income before 1 provision for income taxes 2 other expense income net 3 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 4 amortization of intangible assets and at times 5 certain other transactions or adjustments including impairment related to sublease of leased property certain nonrecurring acquisitionrelated integration and transaction costs and the impact related to the vesting of multiyear restricted stock units granted in 2016 to certain senior executives that are subject to the achievement of multiyear total shareholder return targets which are performance targets with a market condition the “2016 multiyear psus”

“adjusted ebitda expenses” a nongaap measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and at times certain other transactions or adjustments including impairment related to sublease of leased property certain nonrecurring acquisitionrelated integration and transaction costs and the impact related to the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures for management to assess the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant onetime unusual or nonrecurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company’s ongoing operating performance in the period all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on among other things longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments accordingly the company’s computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies

run rate

run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our future operating revenues over time at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” see “— operating metrics — run rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

 

subscription sales 

subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important to management because new subscription sales increase our run rate and represent future operating revenues that will be recognized over time see “— operating metrics — sales ” below for additional information

retention rate

retention rate is a key operating metric and is important to management because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — retention rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

 

 

critical accounting estimates

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected 

goodwill

goodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations undertaken by the company when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on july 1 st and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist the test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level in testing goodwill for impairment the company used the income approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit under the income approach we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows estimating discounted future cash flows requires significant management judgment including in estimating forecasted future cash flows and determining both discount rates and terminal growth rates forecasted future cash flows are estimated based on a combination of historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit discount rates are selected based on discount rates of similar public companies to the reporting unit being valued and terminal growth rates are selected based on consideration of growth rates used during the reporting unit’s forecast period in combination with economic conditions these assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of the reporting unit’s fair value any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value based on our quantitative assessment as of july 1 2021 we determined that the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values so no impairment of goodwill was recorded

 

definite lived intangible assets

definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances include adverse changes in the manner in which the asset will be used adverse changes in legal factors related to the asset or negative changes in expected financial performance of the asset including accumulation of costs and operating losses determining whether an event or changes in circumstances warrant an impairment review involves management judgment

once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary determination of recoverability is determined based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired measurement of impairment for intangible assets is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows used in the determination and calculation of impairments represent management forecasts and require significant management judgment while management believes that its forecasts are reasonable differences between forecasts and actual experience could materially affect the valuations there were no events or changes in 

 

circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definitelived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the years presented 

with respect to our acquisition of rca on september 13 2021 the initial valuation of intangible assets as part of the acquisition method of accounting is subjective and based in part on inputs that are unobservable the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included forecasted cash flows which were determined based on certain assumptions which included among others projected future revenues and expected market royalty rate technology obsolescence rates and discount rates these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made

the company amortizes its intangible assets over the estimated period of economic benefit if the estimated period of economic benefit is changed the prospective amortization of the intangible asset could materially change

income taxes

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and other foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes 

provision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in our opinion it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in assessing the need for a valuation allowance management is required to estimate future taxable income which requires judgment

the company must regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns and adjust unrecognized tax benefits when additional information is available or when an event occurs this assessment requires significant judgment in assessment of tax laws frequency of tax examinations and the nature of intercompany transactions and tax positions

operating revenues

our operating revenues are grouped by the following types recurring subscriptions assetbased fees and nonrecurring we also group operating revenues by major product or reportable segment as follows index analytics esg and climate and all other – private assets which includes the real estate product line and our equity method investment in burgiss

the following table presents operating revenues by type for the years indicated

 



 

 

 

total operating revenues increased 205 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations total operating revenues would have increased 187

operating revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 143 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by strong growth in index products which increased 702 million or 121 strong growth in esg and climate products which increased 527 million or 479 strong growth in all other  private assets products which increased 281 million or 545 and growth in analytics products which increased 269 million or 53 adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations operating revenues from recurring subscriptions would have increased 118

operating revenues from assetbased fees increased 386 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 driven by growth in operating revenues from all indexlinked investment product categories operating revenues from etfs linked to msci equity indexes increased by 419 primarily driven by an increase in average aum partially offset by a decrease in average basis point fees the increase in assetbased fees operating revenues was also driven by revenues from nonetf indexed funds linked to msci indexes which increased by 394 primarily driven by an increase in average aum

total operating revenues grew 88 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations total operating revenues would have increased 87

the following table presents operating expenses by activity category for the years indicated 

 



cost of revenues

cost of revenues increased 230 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 reflecting increases across all segments the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries and incentive compensation and benefits costs as well as higher noncompensation costs primarily reflecting higher professional fees information technology costs and market data costs

cost of revenues decreased 11 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the change was driven by the absence of 70 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus recognized during the year ended december 31 2019 partially offset by increases in other compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries as well as higher noncompensation costs reflecting higher information technology costs partially offset by lower travel and entertainment costs cost of revenues reflects increases across the esg and climate and index reportable segments partially offset by decreases in the analytics and all other – private assets reportable segments

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses increased 123 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 reflecting increases across all segments the change was primarily driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs including higher incentive compensation wages and salaries and benefits costs partially offset by a decline in severance costs

selling and marketing expenses decreased 13 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the change was driven by lower noncompensation costs including travel and entertainment costs and the absence of 45 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus recognized during the year ended december 31 2019 partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries selling and marketing expenses reflect increases across the esg and climate analytics and all other – private assets reportable segments partially offset by a decrease in the index reportable segment

research and development

rd expenses increased 104 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily reflecting higher investment in the index and esg and climate reportable segments partially offset by lower investment in the analytics reportable segment the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher incentive compensation as well as higher noncompensation costs reflecting higher information technology costs

rd expenses increased 28 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs including wages and salaries and benefits costs rd expenses reflect higher investments in the all other – private assets index and esg and climate reportable segments partially offset by lower investment in the analytics reportable segment

 

general and administrative 

ga expenses increased 290 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 reflecting increases across all segments the change was driven by increases in noncompensation costs primarily relating to impairment charges associated with right of use assets nonrecurring transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of rca and higher information technology costs and professional fees the change was also driven by higher compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries and incentive compensation

the following table presents operating expenses using compensation and noncompensation categories rather than using activity categories for the years indicated

 



 

a significant portion of the incentive compensation component of operating expenses is based on the achievement of a number of financial and operating metrics in a scenario where operating revenue growth and profitability moderate incentive compensation would be expected to decrease accordingly

fixed costs constitute a significant portion of the noncompensation component of operating expenses the discretionary noncompensation component of operating expenses could however be reduced in the nearterm in a scenario where operating revenue growth moderates

we had 4303 employees as of december 31 2021 compared to 3633 employees as of december 31 2020 reflecting a 184 growth in the number of employees continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs as of december 31 2021 632 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 646 as of december 31 2020

compensation and benefits costs increased 165 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by headcount growth and higher incentive compensation

noncompensation expenses increased 255 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by higher information technology costs professional fees impairment charges associated with right of use assets nonrecurring transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of rca and market data costs

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets expense increased 415 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by a writeoff of 160 million of certain internally developed capitalized software intangible assets following management’s decision to discontinue development and cease related sales activities of certain analytics segment products and transition existing customers to other product offerings as well as additional amortization recognized on acquired intangible assets following the acquisition of rca

 

amortization of intangible assets expense increased 152 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by higher amortization of internallydeveloped capitalized software

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

other expense income net

the following table shows our other expense income net for the years indicated

 



other expense income net increased 81 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in net expenses was primarily driven by the approximately 373 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the 5000 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 senior notes the “2027 senior notes redemption” and 218 million expense from the redemption of all of the 5000 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 senior notes the “2026 senior notes redemption” during the year ended december 31 2021

the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2027 senior notes redemption included an applicable premium of approximately 336 million as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2027 senior notes and the writeoff of approximately 37 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2027 senior notes the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2026 senior notes redemption included an applicable premium of approximately 182 million as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2026 senior notes and the writeoff of approximately 36 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2026 senior notes

 

the increase in net expenses was partially offset by the absence of the 350 million and 100 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the outstanding 8000 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 senior notes and the redemption of all of the remaining 3000 million of the 5250 senior notes due 2024 during the year ended december 31 2020 respectively and by a onetime gain of 70 million related to the gain resulting from changes in our ownership interest of burgiss  

 

other expense income net increased 303 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in net expenses was primarily driven by the 350 million and 100 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the outstanding 8000 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 senior notes “2025 senior notes redemption” and the redemption of all of the remaining 3000 million of the 2024 senior notes “2024 senior notes redemption” respectively

 

the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2025 senior notes redemption included an applicable premium of approximately 295 million as defined in the indenture governing the terms of the 2025 senior notes and the writeoff of approximately 55 million of unamortized debt issuance costs the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2024 senior notes redemption included a redemption price of approximately 79 million as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2024 senior notes and the writeoff of approximately 21 million of unamortized debt issuance costs

 

in addition the increase in net expenses reflects higher interest expense associated with the higher outstanding debt and lower interest income due to lower rates earned on cash balances offset by the absence of the 168 million loss on extinguishment associated with the partial prematurity redemption of the 2024 senior notes recognized during the year ended december 31 2019

operating metrics

run rate

“run rate” estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements “client contracts” for the next 12 months assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal or reach the end of the committed subscription period are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volumefees the run rate calculation reflects for etfs the market value on the last trading day of the period for futures and options the most recent quarterly volumes andor reported exchange fees and for other nonetf products the most recent clientreported assets run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales whether to existing or new clients when we execute client contracts even though the license start date and associated revenue recognition may not be effective until a later date we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination nonrenewal or an indication the client does not intend to continue their subscription during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services even though such notice is not effective until a later date

changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in run rate the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate for numerous reasons including





















 

 

the following table presents run rates by reportable segment as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated

 



 

december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 

 

total run rate increased 203 driven by an 180 increase from recurring subscriptions and 270 increase from assetbased fees adjusting for the impact of acquisitions or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscriptions run rate would have increased 124 and 190 respectively

sales

sales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from msci and will result in additional operating revenues nonrecurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of run rate new recurring subscription sales represent additional selling activities such as new customer agreements additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to run rate subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period such as discontinuing products and services andor reductions in price resulting in reductions to run rate net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period which reflects the net impact to run rate during the period 

total gross sales represent the sum of new recurring subscription sales and nonrecurring sales total net sales represent the total gross sales net of the impact from subscription cancellations 

 

the following table presents our recurring subscription sales cancellations and nonrecurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated 

 



 

 

 

retention rate

another key metric is our “retention rate” the following table presents our retention rate by reportable segment for the periods indicated

 



 



 

retention rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time the annual retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year 

the retention rate for a nonannual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew or discontinue the subscription during the nonannual period and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the period

for example in the fourth quarter of 2021 we recorded cancellations of 203 million to derive the retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 203 million to derive 814 million of annualized cancellations this 814 million was then divided by the 14442 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year which included rcas run rate as of the date of acquisition to derive a cancellation rate of 56 the 56 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive a retention rate of 944 for the fourth quarter

retention rate is computed by operating segment on a productservicebyproductservice basis in general if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment or switches between products or services within a segment we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our retention rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service in those replacement cases only the net change to the client subscription if a decrease is reported as a cancel in the analytics and the esg and climate operating segments substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner while in our index and real estate operating segments product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur 

 

only in certain limited instances in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down sell of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in index linked investment products or futures and options contracts in each case linked to our indexes 

for the year ended december 31 2021 290 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter in our product lines retention rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year

 

liquidity and capital resources

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facility in addition we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets we intend to use these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures investments acquisitions and dividend payments and make repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

senior notes and credit agreement

the indentures governing our senior notes the “indentures” among us each of the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets in addition the indentures restrict our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create assume incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such nonguarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the senior notes on a pari passu basis

the revolving credit agreement and the indentures also contain customary events of default including those relating to nonpayment breach of representations warranties or covenants crossdefault and crossacceleration and bankruptcy and insolvency events and in the case of the revolving credit agreement invalidity or impairment of loan documentation change of control and customary erisa defaults in addition to the foregoing none of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business

the revolving credit agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the revolving credit agreement 1 the maximum consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 425100 or 450100 for two fiscal quarters following a material acquisition and 2 the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 400100 as of december 31 2021 our consolidated leverage ratio was 328100 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 827100 as of december 31 2021 there were no amounts drawn and outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 

our nonguarantor subsidiaries under the senior notes consist of i domestic subsidiaries of the company that account for 5 or less of consolidated assets of the company and its subsidiaries and ii any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the company that is deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our nonguarantor subsidiaries as of december 31 2021 accounted for approximately 12584 million or 616 of our total revenue for the 12 months ended december 31 2021 approximately 4522 million or 422 of our consolidated operating income for the 12 months ended december 31 2021 and approximately 23349 million or 424 of our consolidated total assets excluding intercompany assets and 10046 million or 177 of our consolidated total liabilities in each case as of december 31 2021

cash flows 

the following table presents the company’s cash and cash equivalents as of the dates indicated

 



 

 

the following table presents the breakdown of the company’s cash flows for the periods indicated

 



 

nm not meaningful

cash and cash equivalents

we typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately 2000 million to 2500 million for general operating purposes as of december 31 2021 and 2020 5422 million and 4234 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions we believe the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purposes or other needs including acquisitions or expansion of our products

cash flows from operating activities

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the yearoveryear increase for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers partially offset by higher payments for income taxes and cash expenses

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses interest expenses income taxes technology costs market data costs and office rent historically the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year

cash flows from investing activities

the yearoveryear change for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by the acquisition of rca partially offset by the absence of the 1908 million equity method investment in burgiss

cash flows from financing activities

the yearoveryear change for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of lower share repurchases and higher proceeds from the senior notes offerings made during the year ended december 31 2021

 

we believe that global cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds  will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect that foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

contractual obligations

our contractual obligations consist primarily of our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases and obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31 2021

 



 





the obligations related to our uncertain tax positions which are not considered material have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement

tableend

foreign currency risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollarreported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 151 and 141 respectively of our revenues were subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily included clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 151 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2021 416 was in euros 265 was in british pounds sterling and 238 was in japanese yen of the 141 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2020 402 was in euros 272 was in japanese yen and 246 was in british pounds sterling

revenues from assetbased fees represented 271 and 236 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively while a substantial portion of our assetbased fees are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the assets in investment products of which approximately threefifths are invested in 

 

securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 411 and 408 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees hungarian forints euros swiss francs mexican pesos and hong kong dollars

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 19 million for the year ended december 31 2021 and foreign currency exchange losses of 28 million for the year ended december 31 2020

summary of risk factors 

 

our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties discussed in more detail in the following section these risks include  among others the following key risks 

 









































 

 

operational risks 

we are dependent on third parties to supply data applications and services for our products and services and are dependent on certain vendors to distribute our products a refusal or failure by a key vendor to distribute our products or any loss of key outside suppliers of data applications or services or a reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data applications or services or any failure by us to comply with our suppliers’ or distributors’ licensing requirements could impair our ability to provide our clients with our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we rely on thirdparty suppliers of data applications and services including data from stock exchanges “vendor products” and depend on the accuracy and quality of vendor products and the ability and willingness of such suppliers to deliver support enhance and develop new vendor products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry needs and other changes in order to produce deliver and develop our products and services additionally we depend on clients to supply certain data in order to provide our services to them any failure to supply errors or reduction in the amount accuracy or quality of such data supplied from clients impairs our ability to provide them with our products and services

if vendor products include errors design defects are delayed become incompatible with future versions of our products are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all we may not be able to deliver our products and services some of our agreements with thirdparty suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and from time to time we receive notices from thirdparty suppliers threatening to terminate the provision of their products or services to us and some data suppliers have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of the provision of vendor products by one or more of our significant suppliers or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with vendor products could decrease the data and materials available for us to use and deliver to our clients in addition some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data or other materials from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data or other materials which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to create our products and services or to provide our clients with the data or other products or services they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base

despite our efforts to comply with the licensing requirements of vendor products our use of certain vendor products has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased acquisition or licensing costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the data or functionality provided by vendor products that become unavailable or fail to operate effectively for any reason our operating costs could increase if additional license fees are imposed or current license fees increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to vendor products are substantial and we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent products or services if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we also rely on certain thirdparty vendors to distribute our data to clients while some of our vendors generate revenue in connection with distributing our data others do not derive a direct financial benefit should any of our key vendors refuse to distribute our data for any reason or require that we pay them new or additional fees in connection with the distribution of our data we would need to find alternative ways to distribute our data or lose revenue or profitability for certain products which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our products and services support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets products or services we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing use of our products or services as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients the parties whose assets are managed by our clients investors in investment products linked to our indexes the companies that we rate or assess in our esg solutions or the shareholders of those companies may pursue claims against us based on even a small error in our data calculations methodologies or analysis or a malfunction or failure in our systems products or services

 

errors or defects can exist at any point in a product’s lifecycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or services or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of and updates to our existing products or services  despite internal testing and in some cases testing or use by clients our products or services may contain errors in our data calculations methodologies or analysis including serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release or deliver a product or service or publish a methodology or analysis we might have to suspend or delay the product or service release or delivery for an extended period of time while we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our products or services or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements or corrections to address such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to do so if undetected errors exist in our products or services  or if our products or services fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our brand or reputation significantly increased costs lost sales delays in commercial release third  party claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products or services  license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors defects or malfunctions the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

while we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our liability from claims brought by our clients or third parties relating to our products or services these provisions could be invalidated or fail to adequately limit our liability which could result in the provision of credits adverse monetary judgments and other penalties and damages any such claims brought against us even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would require attention of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations

the covid19 pandemic or other widespread health crises could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant economic disruption including volatility in the global equity markets our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control including the imposition in many jurisdictions of a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees and vendors to limit the spread of covid19 while we were not materially impacted in 2020 due to ongoing uncertainty related to the duration magnitude and impact of the covid19 pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic its potential effects on our business are uncertain and difficult to predict but may include 















 



these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if the covid19 pandemic is sustained or prolonged these effects could be exacerbated additionally many of the other risk factors described in this item may be exacerbated or the likelihood of such risks materializing may be increased by global widespread health crises such as the covid19 pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic

we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees suppliers business partners and local communities to attempt to mitigate any negative effects of this global pandemic on our business these mitigation efforts have included implementing our businessspecific continuity plans and processes transitioning to a largely global workathome model proactively reducing costs intended to allow us to protect against further downside revenue risk and investing in additional initiatives to support our longterm growth while also focusing on maintaining liquidity and capital structure flexibility we cannot assure you that we will be successful in any of these mitigation efforts

we closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business given the dynamic nature of these circumstances we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of the covid19 pandemic at this time the extent to which our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows are affected by covid19 will depend in part on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain as there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the potential effect of the spread of a global pandemic this situation is changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider significant risks to our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and financial condition may be negatively impacted 

 

msci is exposed to potential reputational and credibility concerns

 

to the extent that any of msci’s operating segments or product lines or msci as a whole suffers a reputational or other loss in credibility it could have a material adverse impact on msci’s business real or perceived factors that may have already affected credibility or which could potentially have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest the editorial independence of our index composition and esg rating processes and decisions the influence of third parties including governments and large investors or asset owners on our editorial decisions the performance of companies relative to their esg ratings index inclusion risk characteristics or other msci content or analytics the timing and nature of changes to our indexes or esg ratings disagreement with our methodologies or models including for calculating indexes valueatrisk and other risk measures esg ratings and related data information and analysis the accuracy and completeness of our data views expressed by the media politicians other government officials or representatives regulators or other third parties regarding our company or our industry or our role in the investment processes our own sustainability and corporate responsibility policies or practices including as a result of i failure to meet publicly disclosed esg and climaterelated targets or goals or ii misalignment with evolving market standards or the methodologies and standards used in our products and esg ratings criticism of our own sustainability and corporate responsibility policies or practices by the companies we evaluate for esg ratings or index inclusion and the impact of political tensions relating to countries industries companies or issues relevant to our products and services such as the inclusion of certain chinese companies in our indexes or the focus on sustainable investing and climate considerations in our offerings errors and other actions by msci competitors could also damage the reputation of the industries that we operate in and therefore harm the reputation of the company or certain of our products 

 

damage to our reputation brand or credibility could have a material adverse impact on msci’s business operating results and financial condition

 

 

client risks 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets under management or total expense ratio of an indexed investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the us our clients including our largest clients may seek for a variety of reasons to negotiate to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant product’s total expense ratio “ter” additionally competition is intense among our clients that offer or manage indexed investment products including etfs and low fees are one of the competitive differentiators where an investment product’s ter determines our fees a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues additionally our clients including our largest clients may seek to lower or eliminate floors on assetbased fees ie minimum assetbased fee percentages or impose or lower ceilings on assetbased fees ie maximum assetbased fee percentages such changes affecting our fees and fee structures could individually or in the aggregate negatively impact our revenues 

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexed investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or switch to a lower fee index for example at least one large client ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds clients that license our indexes to serve as the basis for listed futures and options contracts might also discontinue such contracts additionally we have a differentiated licensing strategy for our indexes and from time to time experience faster growth from lower fee products resulting in a lower average assetbased fee percentage from indexed investment products while we aim to maximize the price and volume tradeoff over the longterm there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in assets in indexed investment products with lower than average fees not sufficiently offset by growth in assets in indexed investment products with higher than average fees our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations finally to the extent that multiple investment products are based on the same index i assets under management in one product could shift to products that pay msci lower fee levels ii the products could compete for the same assets such that none of the products becomes large enough to be successful or sustained or iii the failure or discontinuance of one product  eg  derivatives used for hedging could have a detrimental effect on the use of the other products  eg  etfs

cancellations or reductions by any of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

a material portion of our revenues is concentrated in some of our largest customers for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 110 of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 blackrock accounted for 115 of our total revenues our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients sell additional services to existing clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing licenses failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those licenses our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us for example a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage similarly some of our clients who currently license our risk or esg and climate data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk or embed esg and climate considerations into their investment processes making our products or services unnecessary for them a growing number of asset managers and investment banks in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services or acting together with an industry group or association have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs structured products or overthecounter derivatives to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products or services may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

 

technology risks 

any failures disruptions instability or vulnerabilities in our information technology architecture platforms vendors and service providers production and delivery systems software code internal network the internet or other systems or applications may disrupt our operations cause our products to be unavailable or fail and impose delays or additional costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential and result in reputational and other harm and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and platforms and their components including our data centers cloud providers and other vendors and service providers production and delivery systems as well the internet to create and deliver our products and service our clients our employees also depend on these systems platforms and providers for internal use heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures human error terrorist or other attacks affecting systems or sites where we are located climate or weather related events  eg  natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures technical breakdowns internet failures or computer viruses could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet including our remote work force’s ability to access the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation 

disruptions failures or slowdowns that could occur with respect to our operations including to our information technology systems and platforms our electronic delivery systems or the internet could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation and negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients including delivering managed services or delivering realtime index data there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend against such disruptions or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans will be effective in mitigating the risks and associated costs which could be exacerbated by our shift to an increasingly remote working environment and which could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of data could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media and channels such as the internet applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including sensitive and confidential client data such as material nonpublic information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized data access or disclosure in addition we believe that when we change the composition of our indexes in some cases the changes can have an indirect effect on the prices of constituent securities and on certain indexed investment products as a result of trading activity related to replicating our indexes as the usage and types of uses of our esg ratings increase the ratings and changes to the ratings in some cases could also potentially have an impact on the companies that we rate and the price of their securities 

if our internal processes confidentiality policies conflict of interest policies or information barrier procedures fail or are insufficient including as a result of human error or manual processes or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of data including material nonpublic or other confidential information  eg  certain index composition data or esg rating data our brand and reputation may suffer and we may become subject to litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other penalties leading to a loss of client confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

successful cyberattacks and the failure of cybersecurity plans systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of data and information and on those of our thirdparty vendors we and our vendors are subject to cyber risks including cyberattacks such as phishing scams hacking tampering intrusions viruses ransomware malware and denialofservice attacks in some cases these risks are heightened when employees are working remotely our and our vendors’ use of mobile and cloud technologies may also increase our risk for such threats the company may be exposed to more targeted and more sophisticated cyberattacks aimed at accessing certain information on our systems because of our role or prominence in the global marketplace including client portfolio data the composition of our indexes and msci esg research ratings of corporate issuers any such threats may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or our vendors’ products or services networks systems websites applications data or data processing or may otherwise compromise the availability 

 

confidentiality or integrity of data or information in our possession while the company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material the company has experienced cyberattacks of varying degrees in the past including denialofservice attacks and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future 

our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed cyberattacks security breaches or thirdparty reports of perceived security vulnerability to the company’s systems even if no breach has occurred could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other penalties lead to loss of client confidence which would harm our ability to retain clients and gain new ones and lead to financial losses any of the foregoing could lead to unexpected or higher than estimated costs we may also incur additional costs as a result of increasing and refining our internal processes and software controls and policies and procedures related to security processing integrity and confidentiality or privacy

migration of our applications systems processes and infrastructure to new technologies cloud providers data centers processes platforms or applications could result in unanticipated failures interruptions or delays in the performance and delivery of our products services and client support such incidents could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

in the past we have experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain products after we migrated applications and infrastructure to new data centers while we have taken steps to mitigate such interruptions and delays we cannot provide assurance that they will not occur again in the future as part of major migration efforts  eg  cloud migration even after extensive testing of new systems processes applications and hardware such disruptions may result in cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues after adopting new technologies applications and processes such as cloud computing virtualization and agile software development we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products services and client support we may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from such disruptions accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform cloud providers data centers production and delivery systems applications processes or the internet could negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients damage our brand and reputation and result in litigation which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

our use of open source code could introduce security vulnerabilities into our internal network systems and applications impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or services or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or services or keep them confidential

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims the quality of the code or the security of the code some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary code with open source code in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage additionally the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the use of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible to make generally available portions of our proprietary code to reengineer our products or systems to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely or costeffective basis or to take other remedial action that could divert resources away from our development efforts any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 

 

 

strategy and growth risks 

our business may be affected by changes in the global capital markets including adverse equity market conditions volatility in the financial markets and evolving investment trends such changes could decrease the use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our business is impacted by economic conditions and volatility in the global capital markets our clients use our products for a variety of purposes including benchmarking performance attribution portfolio construction and risk management and to support investment strategies including esg factor thematic private asset and mac investing volatile capital markets may impact whether how where and when investors choose to invest for example between developed or emerging markets us or nonus markets as well as whether to adopt different investment strategies 

the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues 

additionally an increasing portion of our revenues comes from products and services that relate to certain investment trends such as esg and climate factor thematic and mac investing a decline in the equity markets or a trend away from such investment trends could decrease demand for the company’s related products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations to remain competitive we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage product transitions and integrations

competition exists across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product or service some competitors may offer price incentives or different pricing structures that are more attractive to clients the competitive landscape may also experience consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions joint ventures or strategic partnerships which result in a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies

barriers to entry may be low or declining in many of the markets for our products and services including for singlepurpose product companies which could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example more brokerdealers data suppliers credit rating agencies or other market participants or vendors could begin developing their own content such as proprietary risk analytics esg and climate data or indexes recent developments including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information advances in cloud computing increased use of open source code as well as client development of proprietary applications in specific areas have further reduced barriers to entry in some cases 

we may experience pressures to reduce our fees on account of financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic or market conditions which may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer providers by consolidating with other clients or by selfsourcing certain of their information and analytical needs accordingly competitive and market pressures may result in fewer clients or reduced sales including as a result of client closures and consolidations price reductions prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

to remain competitive we must continually introduce new products and services enhance existing products and services including through integration of products and services within msci and with thirdparty platforms and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services we may not be successful in developing introducing implementing marketing pricing launching or licensing new products or enhancements on a timely or costeffective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and systems any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or industry 

 

standards or achieve market acceptance we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also present execution risks and challenges and could lead to price reductions or other concessions  if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services we may not be able to remain competitive and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our global operations and any future expansions may continue to place significant strain on our management and other resources as well as subject us to additional and in some cases unanticipated risks and costs in connection with political economic legal operational and other issues resulting from our increased global footprint which could materially adversely impact our businesses 

our global operations and any future expansion are expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial human resources management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the expansion of our business if we expand organically or by way of acquisition there can be no assurance that our management will be effective in attracting engaging and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing expansion additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive 

our global operations expose us to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments legal uncertainty broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations the majority of our employees are located in offices outside of the us and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate additionally public health epidemics impacting the global economy and our employees such as the worldwide covid19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine and remain compliant with the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally

demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world particularly in emerging market locations where risk management and esg integration practices are often not fully developed in addition the data required to model local securities in some emerging markets might be difficult to source if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services in some locations outside of the us there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries

any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business globally could damage our brand and reputation result in increased costs and litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

legal and regulatory risks 

failure to comply with regulations or the introduction of new regulations or changes to existing regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with any applicable laws rules orders regulations or other requirements could subject us to litigation regulatory actions sanctions fines or other penalties as well as damage our brand and reputation the 

 

financial services industry within which we and many of our clients operate is subject to extensive laws rules and regulation s at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly these laws rules and regulations are complex evolve frequently and sometimes quickly and unexpectedly and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect our business and our clients’ businesses uncertainty caused by political change globally heightens regulatory uncertainty additionally we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws rules or regulations in various jurisdictions which could individually or in the aggregate result in materially higher compliance costs to us it is possible that laws  rules or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license and price our products and services or could impose additional costs on us changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could limit our clients’ ability to use our products and services or could otherwise impact our clients’ demand for our products and services as such to the extent that our clients become subject to certain laws rules or regulations we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services to the extent that we rely on our clients and vendors to provide data for our products and services and certain laws rules or regulations impact our clients’ and vendors’ ability or willingness to provide that data to us or regulate the fees for which such data can be provided our ability to continue to produce our products and services or the related costs could be negatively impacted the regulations and regulatory developments that most significantly impact us are described below 



the euuk trade and cooperation agreement provides some clarity regarding the future relationship between the uk and the eu including some detailed matters of trade and cooperation but there remain uncertainties related to brexit and the new relationship between the uk and eu that will continue to be developed and defined as well as uncertainties related to the wider trading legal regulatory tax and labor environments and the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients because we have significant operations in europe and certain members of our senior management team are based in london any of these uncertainties could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases affect our ability to do business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations



for example the benchmark industry is subject to regulations in the eu such as regulation eu 20161011 as amended and regulation eu no 6002014 as well as increased scrutiny and potential new or increased regulation in various other jurisdictions additionally the european securities and markets authority “esma” issues guidance from time to time regarding interpretations of the benchmark regulation the esma guidelines on etfs and other ucits issues limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” recommends that benchmark administrators on a voluntary basis publicly disclose whether they comply with the principles for financial benchmarks published by iosco other jurisdictions have also indicated they may consider potential benchmark regulation the heightened attention and scrutiny on benchmarks and index providers by regulators 

 

policymakers and the media in the eu the us and other jurisdictions around the world could result in negative publicity or comments about the role or influence of our company or the index industry generally which could harm our reputation and credibility 

further laws rules regulations and orders affecting users of our indexes can have an indirect impact on our indexes including their construction and composition such as sanctions that prohibit users of our indexes from investing or transacting in securities included in our indexes





 

in some instances in connection with the provision of data and services we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject for example a us executive order prohibiting many of our clients from transacting in the securities of certain chinese companies resulted in our decision to remove these companies from relevant indexes in order to support our clients’ needs that our indexes meet their objective to be replicable in investment portfolios to the extent that our clients are subject to increased regulation we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products

 

additionally there has been increased attention on and scrutiny of index and esg ratings providers by politicians regulators policymakers and the media which could create negative publicity that could harm our reputation or credibility as well as result in new or additional regulation that could increase our costs and have a negative impact on profitability

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon their intellectual property rights which in each case could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets patents copyrights and trademark rights as well as technical measures and contractual protections 

 

such as nondisclosure obligations to protect our products and services despite our best efforts we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property are adequate to prevent unauthorized use misappropriation distribution or theft of our intellectual property 

intellectual property laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights the enforceability of intellectual property rights and obligations under our agreements as well as the availability of remedies in the event of a breach may vary due to the different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its brand and reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively 

there is no guarantee that any intellectual property rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights furthermore our competitors may independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential information or to take the necessary steps to enforce our rights in addition our products and services or thirdparty products that we provide to our clients could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 

pursuing intellectual property claims to preserve our intellectual property rights or responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time and result in costly litigation or delays and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful from time to time we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights and the number of these claims may grow these intellectual property claims would likely be costly to defend and could require us to pay damages limit our future use of certain technologies harm our brand and reputation significantly increase our costs and prevent us from offering some services or products we may need to settle such claims on unfavorable terms pay damages stop providing or using the affected products or services or enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may include terms that are not commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there have been a number of lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions including in the us and germany regarding whether issuers of indexed investment products are required to obtain a license from the index owner or whether issuers may issue investment products based on publiclyavailable index level data without obtaining permission from or making payment to the index owner the outcome of these cases depends on a number of factors including the governing law the amount of information about the index available without a license and the other particular facts and circumstances of the cases in some instances the results have been unfavorable to the index owner if courts or regulators or other governmental bodies in relevant jurisdictions determine that a license is not required to issue investment products linked to indexes this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations it might also lead to changes in current industry practices such that we would no longer make our index level data publicly available such as via our website or news media on a timely basis

some of our products and services help our clients to meet their regulatory requirements changes to regulatory requirements may obviate the need for these products or services or may cause us to invest in enhancing the products or services to help our clients meet the new regulatory requirements

financial risks 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded additionally the value of assets in indexed investment products can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

we manage certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes any derivative financial instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase or decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling a weaker british pound sterling means that revenues earned in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar revenues a weaker british pound sterling also means that expenses incurred in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar expenses a weaker british pound sterling could also impair the purchasing power of certain clients and could result in decreased demand for our products and services a fall in the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar and the strengthening of the us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling could have significant impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility

for an overview of our current outstanding indebtedness and history of our offerings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below although we believe that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to pay our obligations as they mature we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity if we are unable to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements however limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 

we may need or want to refinance our existing debt or incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so we may be subject to less favorable terms the risks related to our level of indebtedness could also intensify including by making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness 

furthermore the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit among other things our and our existing and future subsidiaries’ financial flexibility if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default that in some cases if continuing could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under our revolving credit facility 

in 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 and it appears highly likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021 and although alternative reference rates have been proposed it is unknown whether they will attain market acceptance as replacements of libor at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor other benchmarks or floating rate debt instruments including borrowings under the credit agreement dated as of november 20 2014 by and among the company the guarantors party thereto jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and the lenders from time to time party thereto as amended supplemented modified or amended and restated from time to time as amended the “revolving credit facility” the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rate calculated for such borrowings to increase or otherwise fail to correlate over time with the interest rates andor 

 

payments that would have been made on our obligations if libor was available in its current form or have other adverse effects on us to address the transition away from libor our revolving credit facility provides for a process to amend our revolving credit facility to substitute libor with a replacement rate under certain circumstances however there is no guarantee that any such amendment for a replacement rate would become effective and in the event that such amendment does not become effective we may be required to pay a rate of interest higher than expected on any amounts owed under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility if we were to incur any variable rate indebtedness under our revolving credit facility we would be subject to interest rate risk generally  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly  

a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition

our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt our outstanding debt under the senior notes currently has noninvestment grade ratings any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by either or both agencies if in the agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant such future circumstances include but are not limited to adverse changes to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage any such downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain

in addition our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating including obligations to make repurchase offers to the noteholders of our senior notes if the following two conditions are met at the time of or as a result of a change of control or sale of substantially all of the company’s assets i the senior notes are rated below investment grade by each rating agency that rates the senior notes and ii the senior notes are downgraded by any rating agency

any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms accordingly actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook could result in damage to our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt

we may have exposure to tax liabilities in various jurisdictions future changes in tax law could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome or indirect taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate 

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities we may be subject to additional tax liabilities as the jurisdictions in which we do business globally are increasingly focused on digital taxes and the treatment of increasingly remote workforces although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs

 

 

 

general risks 

our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the fullyear financial guidance or longterm targets that we provide publicly

we provide certain fullyear financial guidance and longterm targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results if we fail to meet the fullyear financial guidance or achieve the longterm targets that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance or targets the market value of our common stock or other securities could be adversely affected

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we have experienced significant revenue and earnings growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past if we experience higher than expected operating costs including increased compensation costs regulatory compliance costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion market data costs software license costs communication costs travel costs application development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure cloud usage and other it costs and we cannot adjust to these costs our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected additionally there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development selling and marketing efforts or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past 

we may be exposed to liabilities as a result of failure to comply with anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or benefits or offers of payments or benefits to foreign governments and their officials and in some cases to employees of a business for the purpose of directing obtaining or retaining business we conduct business in countries and regions that are less developed than the us and in some cases are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than fully effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory fines sanctions damages or other penalties or costs violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties damage our brand and reputation and subject us to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize expected returns and synergies from acquisitions or strategic partnerships or investments or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions or strategic partnerships or investments our financial results may be materially adversely affected

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions strategic partnerships and investments despite our best efforts to continue pursuing such transactions there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable strategic partners investment opportunities or candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable terms our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions strategic partnerships and investments depends in part upon our ability to effectively leverage or integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate or that our strategic partnerships and investments will advance the longterm growth strategy of our 

 

company our past and future acquisitions  strategic partnerships and investments may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities including the potential to disrupt our operations additionally strategic partnerships may increase our reliance on third parties which may result in future disruptions if those partnerships are unsuccessful or discontinued or the content or level of support provided by strategic partners is diminished 

in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition strategic partnership or investmentrelated activity within a limited period of time the probability that certain of these risks would occur would likely increase in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses or assets executing strategic partnerships or investments or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our brand or reputation could suffer and our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

our goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income

we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable these impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired

if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge skills experience and abilities of our employees accordingly we believe the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our compensation programs do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive or if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our clients and achieve business objectives may suffer 

we cannot provide any guaranty that we will continue to repurchase our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program

the timing price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions relevant securities laws and other factors the stock repurchases may be made from time to time through one or more open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions including without limitation accelerated share repurchase transactions trading plans or derivative transactions or otherwise

share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with free operating cash flow and borrowings however we are not required to make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any set dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice the reduction or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common shares additionally the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common shares to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our shares as a result any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources

legal proceedings

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us in the ordinary course of business while the amounts claimed could be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainty that exists therefore it is possible that msci’s business operating results financial condition or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of matters that are currently pending or asserted will not individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on msci’s business operating results financial condition or cash flows

key financial metrics and drivers

as discussed in the previous section we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company including gaap and nongaap measures as detailed below we review revenues by type and by segment or by major product line we also review expenses by activity which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed in addition we utilize operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported recurring business

in the discussion that follows we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period while operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes assetbased fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the underlying aum which is the primary component of assetbased fees is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations more than threefifths of the aum are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and accordingly any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currencyadjusted variances

revenues

our revenues are characterized by type which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned our revenue types are recurring subscriptions assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment

recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date 

assetbased fees represent fees earned on the aum linked to our indexes from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client assetbased fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes which are primarily based on trading volumes

nonrecurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts and primarily include revenues for providing historical data certain implementation services and other special client requests which are generally recognized at a point in time 

operating expenses

we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories













costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or when not directly attributable an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved

 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs including data center cloud platform and infrastructure costs costs to acquire produce and maintain market data information costs of research to support and maintain existing products costs of product management teams costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources finance and legal costs 

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams as well as costs incurred in other groups associated with acquiring new business including product management research technology and sales operations

research and development

rd expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and costs to develop new or improved technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development research product management project management and the technology support associated with these efforts

general and administrative

ga expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations human resources office of the ceo legal corporate technology corporate development and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed but are instead allocated to a product or service

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definitelived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and internal capitalized software projects intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships trademarks and trade names technology and software proprietary processes and data and noncompetition agreements we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values we have no indefinitelived intangible assets

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets

other expense income net

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items such as losses on early extinguishment of debt and income and losses associated with our equity method investment

 

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda

“adjusted ebitda” a nongaap measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as net income before 1 provision for income taxes 2 other expense income net 3 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 4 amortization of intangible assets and at times 5 certain other transactions or adjustments including the impact related to the vesting of multiyear restricted stock units granted in 2016 to certain senior executives that are subject to the achievement of multiyear total shareholder return targets which are performance targets with a market condition the “2016 multiyear psus”

“adjusted ebitda expenses” a nongaap measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and at times certain other transactions or adjustments including the impact related to the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures of the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant onetime unusual or nonrecurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company’s ongoing operating performance in the period all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on among other things longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments accordingly the company’s computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures computed by other companies

run rate

run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our operating revenues over time at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” see “— operating metrics — run rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

subscription sales

subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — sales ” below for additional information

retention rate

another key operating metric is retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — retention rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected see note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation— significant accounting policies ” and note 2 “recent accounting standards updates” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a listing of our accounting policies

 

 

factors affecting the comparability of results

share repurchases

the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company’s common stock see note 10 “shareholders’ equity deficit” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program

the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate our diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 12 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease primarily reflects the impact of share repurchases made pursuant to the stock repurchase program and the vesting of the restricted stock units that were included in the dilutive share count in the prior year

senior notes 

we have an aggregate 34000 million of senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2020 see “–liquidity and capital resources–senior notes and credit agreement” below and note 5 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017

tax reform which was enacted on december 22 2017 significantly revised the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering us corporate income tax rates implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on deemed repatriation of historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “toll charge”

total operating revenues grew 88 to 16954 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 15578 million for the year ended december 31 2019 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations total operating revenues would have increased 87 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 82 to 12482 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 11540 million for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by growth in index products which increased 494 million or 93 growth in esg products which increased 204 million or 228 and growth in analytics products which increased 200 million or 41 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscriptions would have increased 81 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

revenues from assetbased fees increased 105 to 3998 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 3619 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in assetbased fees was driven by growth in revenues from all of our indexed investment product categories including an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes that were primarily driven by price increases the increase in revenues from assetbased fees was also driven by higher revenues from nonetf indexed funds linked to msci indexes which was driven by price increases and an increase in average aum revenues from etfs linked to msci indexes also increased driven by an 89 increase in average aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes partially offset by lower fees resulting from the impact of a change in product mix the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from assetbased fees was negligible

cost of revenues

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 11 to 2917 million compared to 2950 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the change was driven by the absence of 70 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus recognized during the year ended december 31 2019 partially offset by increases in other compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries as well as higher noncompensation costs reflecting higher information technology costs partially offset by lower travel and entertainment costs cost of revenues reflects increases across the all other and index reportable segments partially offset by a decrease in the analytics reportable segment

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 13 to 2165 million compared to 2193 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the change was driven by lower noncompensation costs including travel and entertainment costs and the absence of 45 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus recognized during the year ended december 31 2019 partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries selling and marketing expenses reflect increases across the all other and analytics reportable segments partially offset by a decrease in the index reportable segment

research and development

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 28 to 1011 million compared to 983 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs including wages and salaries and benefits costs rd expenses reflect higher investments in the all other and index reportable segments partially offset by lower investment in the analytics reportable segment

general and administrative

ga expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 41 to 1146 million compared to 1101 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher incentive compensation and wages and salaries partially offset by the absence of 35 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus recognized during the year ended december 31 2019 and lower noncompensation costs ga expenses reflect increases across all three reportable segments

 

the following table presents operating expenses using compensation and noncompensation categories rather than using activity categories  for the years indicated  

 



 

compensation and benefits costs are our most significant expense and typically represent approximately 65 of operating expenses or more than 70 of adjusted ebitda expenses we had 3633 employees as of december 31 2020 compared to 3396 employees as of december 31 2019 reflecting a 70 growth in the number of employees continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs as of december 31 2020 646 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 629 as of december 31 2019

compensation and benefits costs for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 17 to 5276 million compared to 5187 million for the year ended december 31 2019 driven by higher wages and salaries incentive compensation and benefits costs partially offset by the absence of 154 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus recognized during the year ended december 31 2019 

noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 38 to 1962 million compared to 2040 million for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by lower travel and entertainment and marketing costs partially offset by higher information technology costs

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets expense for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 152 to 569 million compared to 494 million for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by higher amortization of internallydeveloped capitalized software

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 298 million and 300 million respectively 

other expense income net

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 303 to 1985 million compared to 1524 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in net expenses was primarily driven by the 350 million and 100 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the outstanding 8000 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 senior notes “2025 senior notes redemption” and the redemption of all of the remaining 3000 million of the 2024 senior notes “2024 senior notes redemption” respectively the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2025 senior notes included an applicable premium of approximately 295 million as defined in the indenture governing the terms of the 2025 senior notes and the writeoff of approximately 55 million of unamortized debt issuance costs the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2024 senior notes redemption included a redemption price of approximately 79 million as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2024 senior notes and the writeoff of approximately 21 million of unamortized debt issuance costs in addition the increase reflects higher interest expense associated with the higher outstanding debt and lower interest income due to lower rates earned on cash balances offset by the absence of the 168 million loss on extinguishment associated with the partial prematurity redemption of the 2024 senior notes recognized during the year ended december 31 2019

 

income taxes 

the provision for income tax is 844 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 397 million for the year ended december 31 2019 these amounts reflect effective tax rates of 123 and 66 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the effective tax rate of 123 for the year ended december 31 2020 reflects the impact of certain discrete items totaling 479 million these discrete items primarily relate to 222 million of excess tax benefits recognized on the vesting of equity awards during the period and 208 million released during the year related to the favorable impact on prior years from final regulations clarifying certain provisions of tax reform also included in the discrete items is a 63 million benefit related to the revaluation of the cost of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings

the effective tax rate of 66 for the year ended december 31 2019 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling 857 million these discrete items primarily relate to 666 million of excess tax benefits recognized upon vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus and 161 million of excess tax benefits on other sharebased compensation recognized during the period in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by a beneficial geographic mix of earnings

net income

operating metrics

run rate

“run rate” estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements “client contracts” for the next 12 months assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volumefees the run rate calculation reflects for etfs the market value on the last trading day of the period for futures and options the most recent quarterly volumes andor reported exchange fees and for other nonetf products the most recent clientreported assets run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales whether to existing or new clients when we execute client contracts even though the license start date and associated revenue recognition may not be effective until a later date we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services even though such notice is not effective until a later date

changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in run rate the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate for numerous reasons including





















 

 

the following table presents run rates by reportable segment as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated

 



 

total run rate grew 121 to 18325 million as of december 31 2020 compared to 16345 million as of december 31 2019 recurring subscription run rate grew 105 to 13684 million as of december 31 2020 compared to 12383 million as of december 31 2019 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscription run rate would have increased 94 as of december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 

run rate from assetbased fees increased 172 to 4641 million as of december 31 2020 from 3961 million as of december 31 2019 driven by higher aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes higher prices in futures and options and higher prices in nonetf indexed funds linked to msci indexes partially offsetting the impact of the increase in aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes was a change in fee levels of certain products as well as change in product mix which was the primary driver of a decline in average basis point fees to 267 at december 31 2020 from 282 at december 31 2019 as of december 31 2020 the value of aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes was 11036 billion up 1692 billion or 181 from 9344 billion as of december 31 2019 the increase of 1692 billion consisted of market appreciation of 936 billion and net inflows of 756 billion 

index recurring subscription run rate grew 106 to 6184 million as of december 31 2020 compared to 5593 million as of december 31 2019 primarily driven by strong growth in market capweighted index products custom and specialized index products and factor and esg and climate index products

run rate from analytics products increased 54 to 5551 million as of december 31 2020 compared to 5268 million as of december 31 2019 driven by growth in both multiasset class and equity analytics products adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations analytics run rate would have increased 40 as of december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019

run rate from all other products increased 280 to 1948 million as of december 31 2020 compared to 1522 million as of december 31 2019 the 426 million increase was primarily driven by a 369 million or 364 increase in esg run rate to 1383 million and a 57 million or 112 increase in real estate run rate to 565 million the increase in esg run rate was primarily driven by strong growth in ratings and climate products the increase in real estate run rate was driven by growth in both enterprise analytics and global intel products adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations all other run rate would have increased 239 esg run rate would have increased 326 and real estate run rate would have increased 66 as of december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019

 

sales

sales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from msci and will result in additional operating revenues nonrecurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of run rate new recurring subscription sales represent 

 

additional selling activities such as new customer agreements additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to run rate subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period such as discontinuing products and services andor reductions in price resulting in reductions to run rate net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period which reflects the net impact to run rate during the period  

total gross sales represent the sum of new recurring subscription sales and nonrecurring sales total net sales represent the total gross sales net of the impact from subscription cancellations 

the following table presents our recurring subscription sales cancellations and nonrecurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated

 



 

 

retention rate

another key metric is our “retention rate” the following table presents our retention rate by reportable segment and product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

 



 

retention rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time the annual retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year 

the retention rate for a nonannual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew during the nonannual period and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the period 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2020 we recorded cancellations of 230 million to derive the retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 230 million to derive 921 million of annualized cancellations this 921 million was then divided by the 12383 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 74 the 74 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive a retention rate of 926 for the fourth quarter 

retention rate is computed by operating segment on a productservicebyproductservice basis in general if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment or switches between products or services within a segment we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our retention rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service in those replacement cases only the net change to the client subscription if a decrease is reported as a cancel in the analytics and the esg operating segments substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner while in our index and real estate operating segments product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a downsale of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in indexed investment products or futures and options contracts in each case linked to our indexes 

for the year ended december 31 2020 304 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter in our product lines retention rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities in addition we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets we intend to use these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

senior notes and credit agreement

we have an aggregate of 34000 million in senior unsecured notes collectively the “senior notes” outstanding and a 4000 million undrawn revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks as of december 31 2020 see note 5 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement

the indentures governing our senior notes the “indentures” among us each of the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets in addition the indentures restrict our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create assume incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such nonguarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the senior notes on a pari passu basis

the revolving credit agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that among other things limit our ability and the ability of our existing or future subsidiaries to

























 

 





the revolving credit agreement and the indentures also contain customary events of default including those relating to nonpayment breach of representations warranties or covenants crossdefault and crossacceleration bankruptcy and insolvency events invalidity or impairment of loan documentation or collateral change of control and customary erisa defaults none of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business

the revolving credit agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the revolving credit agreement 1 the maximum consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 425100 and 2 the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 400100 as of december 31 2020 our consolidated leverage ratio was 321100 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 629100 as of december 31 2020 there were no amounts drawn and outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 

our nonguarantor subsidiaries under the senior notes consist of i domestic subsidiaries of the company that account for 5 or less of consolidated assets of the company and its subsidiaries and ii any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the company that is deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our nonguarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately 9893 million or 584 of our total revenue for the 12 months ended december 31 2020 approximately 3517 million or 398 of our consolidated operating income for the 12 months ended december 31 2020 and approximately 10654 million or 253 of our consolidated total assets excluding intercompany assets and 7569 million or 163 of our consolidated total liabilities in each case as of december 31 2020

share repurchases

the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company’s common stock in the open market see note 10 “shareholders’ equity deficit” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program

cash flows

the following table presents the company’s cash and cash equivalents as of the dates indicated

 



 

 

 

the following table presents the breakdown of the company’s cash flows for the periods indicated

 



 

cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents were 13005 million and 15066 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately 2000 million to 2500 million for general operating purposes but may maintain higher minimum cash balances while the covid19 pandemic continues to impact global economic markets as of december 31 2020 and 2019 4234 million and 3212 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries as a result of tax reform we can now more efficiently access a significant portion of our cash held outside of the us in the shortterm without being subject to us income taxes repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purpose or other needs including acquisitions or expansion of our products

cash flows from operating activities

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 8111 million and 7095 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers partially offset by higher payments for income taxes interest and cash expenses

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs market data costs interest expenses and income taxes historically the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year

cash flows from investing activities

cash used in investing activities was 2418 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 719 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the yearoveryear change was primarily driven by the 1908 million investment in burgiss

cash flows from financing activities

cash used in financing activities was 7790 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 367 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the yearoveryear change was primarily driven by higher share repurchases the impact of the 2024 senior notes redemption and the 2025 senior notes redemption partially offset by the impact of new senior notes offerings made during the periods

we believe that global cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect that foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

 

contractual obligations

our contractual obligations consist primarily of our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases and obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31 2020

 



 





the obligations related to our uncertain tax positions which are not considered material have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2020 and 2019 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

foreign currency risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollarreported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 141 and 135 respectively of our revenues were subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily included clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 141 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2020 402 was in euros 272 was in japanese yen and 246 was in british pounds sterling of the 135 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2019 408 was in euros 269 was in japanese yen and 231 was in british pounds sterling 

revenues from assetbased fee “abf” products represented 236 and 232 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for abf products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which more than threefifths are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other 

 

currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 408 and 412 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees hungarian forints euros hong kong dollars swiss francs and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 28 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and foreign currency exchange losses of 40 million for the year ended december 31 2019

our principal business model is generally to license annual recurring subscriptions for the majority of our index analytics and esg products and services for a fee due in advance of the service period we also license annual recurring subscriptions for the majority of our real estate products for a fee which is primarily paid in arrears after the product is delivered with the exception of the market information product for which the fees are generally paid in advance a portion of our fees comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such fees are primarily based on a client’s assets under management “aum” and trading volumes see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview” and note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation— significant accounting policies — revenue recognition ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on how we generate revenue and our revenue recognition policy

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected you should read the section titled “forwardlooking statements” on page 1 for a description of the types of statements that are considered forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10k this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

operational risks 

we are dependent on third parties to supply data applications and services for our products and services and are dependent on certain vendors to distribute our products a refusal or failure by a key vendor to distribute our products or any loss of key outside suppliers of data applications or services or a reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data applications or services or any failure by us to comply with our suppliers’ or distributors’ licensing requirements could impair our ability to provide our clients with our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we rely on thirdparty suppliers of data applications and services including data from stock exchanges “vendor products” and depend on the accuracy and quality of vendor products and the ability and willingness of such suppliers to deliver support enhance and develop new vendor products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in order to produce deliver and develop our products and services

if vendor products include errors design defects are delayed become incompatible with future versions of our products are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all we may not be able to deliver our products and services some of our agreements with third party suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements for all our vendor products such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from third party suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their products or services to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of the provision of vendor products by one or more of our significant suppliers or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with vendor products could decrease the data and materials available for us to use and deliver to our clients in addition some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data or other materials from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data or other materials which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to create our products and services or to provide our clients with the data or other products or services they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base

despite our efforts to comply with the licensing requirements of vendor products our use of certain vendor products has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased acquisition or licensing costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by vendor products that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason our operating costs could increase if additional license fees are imposed or current license fees increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to vendor products are substantial and we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent products or services if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

we also rely on certain thirdparty vendors to distribute our data to clients while some of our vendors generate revenue in connection with distributing our data others do not derive a direct financial benefit should any of our key vendors refuse to distribute our data for any reason or require that we pay them fees in connection with the distribution of our data we would need to find alternative ways to distribute our data or lose revenue in connection with paying distribution fees which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge skills experience and abilities of our employees accordingly we believe the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our compensation programs do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive or if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our clients and achieve business objectives may suffer 

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our products and services support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing use of our products or services as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients the parties whose assets are managed by our clients or the companies that we rate or assess in our esg segment may pursue claims against us based on even a small error in our data calculations methodologies or analysis or a malfunction or failure in our systems products or services

errors or defects can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of and updates to our products despite internal testing and in some cases testing or use by clients our products may contain errors in our data calculations methodologies or analysis including serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release or deliver a product or publish a methodology or analysis we might have to suspend or delay the product release or delivery for an extended period of time while we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements or corrections to address such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to do so if undetected errors exist in our products or if our products fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our brand or reputation significantly increased costs lost sales delays in commercial release third party claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors defects or malfunctions the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

while we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or services or our delay or failure to provide services these provisions could be invalidated or fail to eliminate liability resulting from the occurrence of any of these events which could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments any such claims brought against us even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would require attention of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations

 

client risks 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets under management or total expense ratio of an indexlinked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the us our clients including our largest clients may seek for a variety of reasons to negotiate to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant product’s total expense ratio “ter” additionally competition is intense among our clients that offer or manage indexlinked investment products including etfs and low fees are one of the competitive differentiators where an investment product’s ter determines our fees a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues additionally our clients including our largest clients may seek to lower or eliminate floors on assetbased fees ie minimum assetbased fee percentages or impose or lower ceilings on assetbased fees ie maximum assetbased fee percentages such changes affecting our fees and fee structures could individually or in the aggregate negatively impact our revenues 

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or switch to a lower fee index for example at least one large client ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds clients that license our indexes to serve as the basis for listed futures and options contracts might also discontinue such contracts additionally we have a differentiated licensing strategy for our indexes and from time to time experience faster growth from lower fee products resulting in a lower average assetbased fee percentage from indexlinked investment products while we aim to maximize the price and volume tradeoff over the longterm there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in assets in indexlinked investment products with lower than average fees not sufficiently offset by growth in assets in indexlinked investment products with higher than average fees our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations finally to the extent that multiple investment products are based on the same index i assets under management in one product could shift to products that pay msci lower fee levels ii the products could compete for the same assets such that none of the products becomes large enough to be successful or sustained or iii the failure or discontinuance of one product eg derivatives used for hedging could have a detrimental effect on the use of the other products eg etfs

cancellations or reductions by any of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

a material portion of our revenues is concentrated in some of our largest customers for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 115 of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 blackrock accounted for 119 of our total revenues our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing licenses failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those licenses our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us for example a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage for example on september 20 2016 blackrock received exemptive relief from the sec to create certain indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage similarly some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products or services unnecessary for them a growing number of asset managers and investment banks in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services or acting together with an industry group or association have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs structured products or overthecounter derivatives to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products or services may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

technology risks 

any failures disruptions instability or vulnerabilities in our information technology architecture platforms production and delivery systems software code internal network the internet or other systems or applications may cause our products to be unavailable or fail and impose delays or additional costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential and result in reputational and other harm and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and platforms and their components including our data centers and production and delivery systems as well the internet to create and deliver our products and service our clients heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures human error terrorist or other attacks affecting systems or sites where we are located climate or weather related events eg natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures technical breakdowns internet failures or computer viruses could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation 

disruptions failures or slowdowns that could occur with respect to our operations including to our information technology systems and platforms our electronic delivery systems or the internet could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation and negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients including delivering managed services or delivering realtime index data there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend against such disruptions or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans will be effective in mitigating the risks and associated costs which could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of data could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including sensitive and confidential client data such as material nonpublic information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized data access or disclosure in addition we change the composition of our indexes from time to time and we believe that in some cases such changes can have an indirect effect on the prices of constituent securities and on certain indexlinked investment products based on our indexes as a result of trading activity related to replicating our indexes 

if our internal processes confidentiality policies conflict of interest policies or information barrier procedures fail or are insufficient including as a result of human error or manual processes or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of data including material nonpublic or other confidential information eg index composition data our brand and reputation may suffer and we may become subject to litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other penalties leading to a loss of client confidence which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

successful cyberattacks and the failure of cybersecurity systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of data and information and on those of its thirdparty vendors we and our vendors are subject to cyber risks including cyberattacks such as phishing scams hacking tampering intrusions viruses ransomware malware and denialofservice attacks our and our vendors’ use of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for such threats the company may be exposed to more targeted and more sophisticated cyberattacks aimed at accessing certain information on our systems because of our prominence in the global marketplace including client portfolio data the composition of our indexes and msci esg research ratings of corporate issuers any such threats may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or our vendors’ products or services networks systems websites applications data or data processing or may otherwise compromise the availability confidentiality or integrity of data or information in our possession while the company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material the company has experienced cyberattacks of varying degrees in the past including denialofservice attacks and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future 

 

our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed cyberattacks security breaches or thirdparty reports of perceived security vulnerability to the company’s systems even if no breach has occurred could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation regulatory actions sanctions or other penalties lead to loss of client confidence in our security measures and reliability which would harm our ability to retain clients and gain new ones and lead to financial losses any of the foregoing could lead to unexpected or higher than estimated costs we may also incur additional costs as a result of increasing and refining our internal processes and software controls and policies and procedures related to security processing integrity and confidentiality or privacy 

migration of our applications systems processes and infrastructure to new technologies data centers processes platforms or applications could result in unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of our products which could impair our ability to provide clients with products and customer service such impairment may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain products after we migrated applications and infrastructure to new data centers while we have taken steps to mitigate such interruptions and delays we cannot provide assurance that they will not occur again in the future even after extensive testing of new systems processes applications and hardware such disruptions may result in cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues after adopting new technologies applications and processes such as cloud computing virtualization and agile software development we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products and services we may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from such disruptions accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform data centers production and delivery systems applications processes or the internet could negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients damage our brand and reputation and result in litigation which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

our use of open source code could introduce security vulnerabilities into our internal network system impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims the quality of the code or the security of the code some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary applications with open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage additionally the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the use of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible to make generally available portions of our proprietary code to reengineer our products or systems to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely or costeffective basis or to take other remedial action that could divert resources away from our development efforts any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 

 

strategy and growth risks 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we have experienced significant revenue and earnings growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past if we experience higher than expected operating costs including increased compensation costs regulatory compliance costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs application development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other it costs and we cannot adjust to these costs our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected additionally there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development marketing efforts or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past 

our business may be affected by changes in the global capital markets including adverse equity market conditions volatility in the financial markets and evolving investment trends such changes could decrease the use of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our business is impacted by economic conditions and volatility in the global capital markets our clients use our products for a variety of investment objectives including benchmarking and portfolio construction and esg factor private real estate and mac investing volatile capital markets may impact whether investors choose to invest in developed or emerging markets or in the us or nonus markets as well as whether to adopt different investment styles 

our equity indexes serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments and are also used by clients as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products for a fee based on the value of the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues our analytics segment offers performance attribution and portfolio management content applications and services and mac models that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return of their portfolios across markets and asset classes additionally equity models developed in our analytics segment are used to construct msci factor indexes our esg segment offers esg ratings and research on companies worldwide to provide clients with an understanding of how esg factors can impact the longterm risk of their investments such research is also used in the construction of equity and fixed income indexes which help investors more effectively benchmark esg investment performance and manage and measure esg mandates 

additionally an increasing portion of our revenues comes from products that relate to certain investment trends such as esg factor and mac investing a decline in the equity markets or a trend away from such investment trends could decrease demand for the company’s related products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations to remain competitive we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage product transitions and integrations

competition exists across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product some competitors may offer price incentives or different pricing structures that are more attractive to clients the competitive landscape may also experience consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions joint ventures or strategic partnerships which result in a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies

 

barriers to entry may be low or declining in many of the markets for our products and services including for singlepurpose product companies which could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example more brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes recent developments including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information advances in cloud computing increased use of open source code as well as client development of proprietary applications in specific areas have further reduced barriers to entry in some cases 

we may experience pressures to reduce our fees on account of financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic or market conditions may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer providers by consolidating with other clients or by selfsourcing certain of their informational and analytical needs accordingly competitive and market pressures may result in fewer clients or reduced sales including as a result of client closures and consolidations price reductions prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

to remain competitive we must continually introduce new products and services enhance existing products and services including through integration of products and services within msci and with thirdparty platforms and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services we may not be successful in developing introducing implementing marketing pricing launching or licensing new products or enhancements on a timely or costeffective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and systems any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or industry standards or achieve market acceptance we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also present execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize synergies from acquisitions or strategic partnerships or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions or strategic partnerships our financial results may be materially adversely affected

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions and strategic partnerships despite our best efforts to continue pursuing such transactions there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable strategic partners or candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable terms our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions and strategic partnerships depends in part upon our ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into our operations we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate or that our strategic partnerships will advance the longterm growth strategy of our company our past and future acquisitions and strategic partnerships may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities including the potential to disrupt our operations any acquisition or strategic partnership could present a number of risks including incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or strategic partnerships failure to achieve assumed synergies or successful integration of operations and management increased debt associated with such transactions dilution of our common stock loss of key personnel and diversion of management’s attention from existing operations additionally strategic partnerships may increase our reliance on thirdparties which may result in future disruptions if those partnerships are discontinued or the content or level of support provided by strategic partners is diminished

in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition or strategic partnershiprelated activity within a limited period of time the probability that these risks would occur would likely increase in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses or assets executing strategic partnerships or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our brand or reputation could suffer and our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 

our global operations and any future expansion may continue to place significant strain on our management and other resources as well as subject us to additional and in some cases unanticipated risks and costs in connection with political economic legal operational and other issues resulting from our increased global footprint which could materially adversely impact our businesses 

our global operations and any future expansion is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial human resources management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the expansion of our business there can also be no assurance that if in the future we expand organically or by way of acquisition our management will be effective in attracting engaging and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing expansion additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive 

our global operations expose us to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments legal uncertainty broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the us and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations for example as of december 31 2019 629 of our employees were located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate additionally public health epidemics impacting the global economy and our employees such as covid19 that originated in china and has had reverberating effects around the world particularly in the apac region may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine and remain compliant with the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally

demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world particularly in emerging market locations many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and esg and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the us there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries

any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business globally could damage our brand and reputation result in increased costs and litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

legal and regulatory risks 

new regulations or changes to current regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

failure to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations could damage our brand and reputation and we may become subject to litigation regulatory actions sanctions fines or other penalties the financial services industry within which we and many of our clients operate is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly these regulations are complex evolve frequently and sometimes quickly and unexpectedly and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect our 

 

business and our clients’ businesses uncertainty caused by political change in the us europe and asia heightens regulatory uncertainty additionally we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws rules or regulations in various jurisdictions which could individually or in the aggregate result in materially higher compliance costs to us it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license and price our products and services or could impose additional costs on us changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could limit our clients’ ability to use our products and services or could otherwise impact our clients’ demand for our products and services as such to the extent that our clients become subject to certain laws rules or regulations we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services to the extent that we rely on our clients and vendors to provide data for our products and services and certain laws rules or regulations impact our clients’ and vendors’ ability or willingness to provide that data to us or regulate the fees for which such data can be provided our ability to continue to produce our products and services or the related costs could be negatively impacted the regulations that most materially impact us are described below 



there is also uncertainty as to how the uk’s access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results because we have significant operations in europe and certain members of our senior management team are based in london for example changes in labor immigration and tax laws could increase the cost to our staff of living and working in the uk or the eu and may impact our ability to hire and retain nonuk staff in the uk or uk staff in the eu a change in such regulations or other regulations could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases affect our ability to do business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations



for example the benchmark industry is subject to regulations in the eu such as regulation eu 20161011 and regulation eu no 6002014 as well as increased scrutiny and potential new or increased regulation in various other jurisdictions additionally the european securities and markets authority “esma” issues guidance from time to time regarding interpretations of the benchmark regulation the esma guidelines on etfs and other ucits issues limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” recommends that benchmark administrators on a voluntary basis publicly disclose whether they comply with the principles for financial benchmarks published by iosco the heightened attention and scrutiny on benchmarks and index providers by regulators policymakers and the media in the eu the us and other jurisdictions around the world could result 

 

in negative publicity or comments about the role or influence of our company or the index industry generally which could harm our reputation and credibility  





 

in some instances in connection with the provision of data and services we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject to the extent that our clients are subject to increased regulation we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products

 

additionally there has been increased attention on and scrutiny of esg ratings providers by regulators policymakers and the media which could create negative publicity that could harm our reputation or credibility as well as result in new or additional regulation that could increase our costs and have a negative impact on profitability

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon their intellectual property rights which in each case could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets patents copyrights and trademark rights as well as technical measures and contractual protections such as nondisclosure obligations to protect our products and services despite our best efforts we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property are adequate to prevent unauthorized use misappropriation distribution or theft of our intellectual property 

intellectual property laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights the enforceability of intellectual property 

 

rights and obligations under our agreements as well as the availability of remedies in the event of a breach may vary due to the different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located failure to protect the company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its brand and reputation and affect the company’s ability to compete effectively 

there is no guarantee that any intellectual property rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights furthermore our competitors may independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property or disclosure of confidential information and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights in addition our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 

pursuing intellectual property claims or responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time and result in costly litigation or delays and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful from time to time we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights and the number of these claims may grow these intellectual property claims would likely be costly to defend and could require us to pay damages limit our future use of certain technologies harm our brand and reputation significantly increase our costs and prevent us from offering some services or products we may need to settle such claims on unfavorable terms pay damages stop providing or using the affected products or services or enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may include terms that are not commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there have been a number of lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions including in the us and germany regarding whether issuers of indexlinked investment products are required to obtain a license from the index owner or whether issuers may issue investment products based on publiclyavailable index level data without obtaining permission from or making payment to the index owner the outcome of these cases depends on a number of factors including the governing law the amount of information about the index available without a license and the other particular facts and circumstances of the cases in some instances the results have been unfavorable to the index owner if courts or regulators or other governmental bodies in relevant jurisdictions determine that a license is not required to issue investment products linked to indexes this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations it might also lead to changes in current industry practices such that we would no longer make our index level data publicly available such as via our website or news media on a timely basis

we may be exposed to liabilities as a result of failure to comply with anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or benefits or offers of payments or benefits to foreign governments and their officials and in some cases to employees of a business for the purpose of directing obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than fully effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties damage our brand and reputation and subject us to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

in connection with our initial public offering and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant

financial risks 

our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the fullyear financial guidance or longterm targets that we provide publicly

we provide fullyear financial guidance and longterm targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance for example we provide assumptions regarding our ability to achieve certain subscription revenue growth manage our expenses generate free cash flow achieve an effective tax rate within a certain range and achieve our profitability targets while we believe that our annual financial guidance and longterm targets provide investors and analysts with insight to our view of the company’s future performance such financial guidance and longterm targets are based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results if we fail to meet the fullyear financial guidance or achieve the longterm targets that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance or targets the market value of our common stock or other securities could be adversely affected

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded additionally the value of assets in indexlinked investment products can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk see part ii item 7a “—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency risk”

we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes any derivative financial instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations depending on the final terms reached between the uk and the eu brexit has and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling the weaker british pound sterling means that revenues earned in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar revenues the weaker british pound sterling also means that expenses incurred in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar expenses the weaker british pound sterling could also impair the purchasing power of our clients and could result in decreased demand for our products and services the fall in the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar and the strengthening of the us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling could have significant impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility our variable rate indebtedness could subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

for an overview of our current outstanding indebtedness and history of our offerings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below although we believe that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or access offshore cash we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity and we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all absent sufficient cash flow from our operations and the ability to refinance we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements however limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected

we may need to incur additional debt from time to time under our existing debt agreements to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify including by making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness

furthermore the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit among other things our and our existing and future subsidiaries’ financial flexibility if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default that in some cases if continuing could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under our revolving credit agreement see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for a description of the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements

in 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 and there is a substantial risk that libor will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021 and although alternative reference rates have been proposed it is unknown whether they will attain market acceptance as replacements of libor at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor other benchmarks or floating rate debt instruments including borrowings under the credit agreement dated as of november 20 2014 by and among the company the guarantors party thereto jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and the lenders from time to time party thereto as amended supplemented modified or amended and restated from time to time the “revolving credit facility” the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rate calculated for such borrowings to increase or otherwise fail to correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been made on our obligations if libor was available in its current form or have other adverse effects on us to address the transition away from libor our revolving credit facility provides for a process to amend our revolving credit facility to substitute libor with a replacement rate under certain circumstances however there is no guarantee that any such amendment for a replacement rate would become effective and in the event that such amendment does not become effective we may be required to pay a rate of interest higher than expected on the amount owed under our revolving credit facility

 

a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt our outstanding debt under the senior notes currently has noninvestment grade ratings any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by either or both agencies if in the agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant such future circumstances include but are not limited to adverse changes to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage for example on july 28 2015 the board of directors authorized corporate action that led to a change in the company’s target leverage and interest expense allowing for the issuance of our 2025 senior notes on august 13 2015 following the board of directors’ authorization one of the ratings agencies described the increase as substantially higher than current leverage levels and as a result downgraded our credit rating this downgrade and any further downgrade could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain

in addition our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating including obligations to make repurchase offers to the noteholders of our senior notes if the following two conditions are met at the time of or as a result of a change of control or sale of substantially all of the company’s assets i the senior notes are rated below investment grade by each rating agency that rates the senior notes and ii the senior notes are downgraded by any rating agency

any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms accordingly actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook could result in damage to our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt

we may have exposure to tax liabilities in various jurisdictions future changes in tax law could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome or indirect taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate in particular brexit could create uncertainty with respect to our corporate tax rate as well as the tax rates of our employees based in the uk

the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” was enacted on december 22 2017 and significantly affected us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations tax reform requires complex computations not previously provided in us tax law further compliance with tax reform and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced the us department of treasury has broad authority and is continuing to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and may impact our results of operations

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs

 

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 18244 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2019 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable these impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired

key financial metrics and drivers

as discussed in the previous section we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company including gaap and nongaap measures as detailed below we review revenues by type and by segment or by major product line we also review expenses by activity which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed in addition we utilize operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business

in the discussion that follows we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period while operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes assetbased fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the underlying aum which is the primary component of assetbased fees is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations approximately twothirds of the aum are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and accordingly any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currencyadjusted variances

revenues

our revenues are characterized by type which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned our revenue types are recurring subscription assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment

recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date 

assetbased fees represent fees earned on the aum linked to our indexes from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client assetbased fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes which are primarily based on trading volumes

nonrecurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts and primarily include revenues for providing historical data certain implementation services and other special client requests which are generally recognized at a point in time 

operating expenses

we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories













costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or when not directly attributable an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved

 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs including data center platform and infrastructure costs costs to acquire produce and maintain market data information costs of research to support and maintain existing products costs of product management teams costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources finance and legal costs

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams as well as costs incurred in other groups associated with acquiring new business including product management research technology and sales operations

research and development

rd expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and costs to develop new or improved technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development research product management project management and the technology support associated with these efforts

general and administrative

ga expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations human resources office of the ceo legal corporate technology corporate development and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed but are instead allocated to a product or service

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definitelived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and internal capitalized software projects intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships trademarks and trade names technology and software proprietary processes and data and noncompetition agreements we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values we have no indefinitelived intangible assets

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets

other expense income net

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items

 

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda

“adjusted ebitda” a nongaap measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as net income before 1 provision for income taxes 2 other expense income net 3 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 4 amortization of intangible assets and at times 5 certain other transactions or adjustments including the impact related to the vesting of multiyear restricted stock units granted in 2016 to certain senior executives that are subject to the achievement of multiyear total shareholder return targets which are performance targets with a market condition the “2016 multiyear psus”

“adjusted ebitda expenses” a nongaap measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and at times certain other transactions or adjustments including the impact related to the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures of the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant onetime unusual or nonrecurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company’s core operating performance in the period all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on among other things longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments accordingly the company’s computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures computed by other companies

run rate

run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our operating revenues over time at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” see “— operating metrics — run rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

subscription sales

subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — subscription sales ” below for additional information

retention rate

another key operating metric is retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — retention rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected see note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation— significant accounting policies ” and note 2 “recent accounting standards updates” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a listing of our accounting policies

 

factors affecting the comparability of results

divestitures

on april 9 2018 we completed the divestiture of fea for 210 million in cash which resulted in a gain of 106 million fea was included as a component of the analytics segment through the date of divestiture the results of operations from fea were not material to the company 

on october 12 2018 we completed the divestiture of investorforce and received 628 million in cash which resulted in a gain of 466 million investorforce was included as a component of the analytics segment through the date of divestiture the results of operations from investorforce were not material to the company 

share repurchases

the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company’s common stock see note 10 “shareholders’ equity deficit” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program

the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate our diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased by 46 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease primarily reflects the impact of share repurchases made prior to march 31 2019 pursuant to the 2016 and 2018 repurchase programs and the vesting of the restricted stock units that were included in the dilutive share count in the prior year

senior notes 

we have an aggregate 31000 million of senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2019 see “–liquidity and capital resources–senior notes and credit agreement” below and note 5 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017

tax reform which was enacted on december 22 2017 significantly revised the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering us corporate income tax rates implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on deemed repatriation of historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “toll charge” 

in the year ended december 31 2018 the company finalized the toll charge and determined the final impact of tax reform resulting in a net benefit of 112 million that included a benefit of 57 million on the trueup of the toll charge and a benefit of 26 million for a reduction in the expected withholding taxes from foreign subsidiaries the company also recorded a benefit of 29 million related to the revaluation of deferred taxes at the lower statutory rate as a result of tax planning 

 

 

results of operations

the following table presents the results of operations for the years indicated

 



 

operating revenues

our revenues are grouped by the following types recurring subscription assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues we also group revenues by major product lines as follows index analytics and all other which includes the esg and real estate product lines

the following table presents operating revenues by recurring subscriptions assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues for the years indicated

 



 

total operating revenues grew 86 to 15578 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 14340 million for the year ended december 31 2018 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations total operating revenues would have increased 89 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 

 

revenue from recurring subscriptions increased 82 to 11540 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 10665 million for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily driven by growth in index products which increased 534 million or 112 and growth in all other products which increased 222 million or 194 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscriptions would have increased 85 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 

revenues from assetbased fees increased 75 to 3619 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 3366 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase in assetbased fees was primarily driven by an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes the increase in revenues from futures and options contracts was driven by approximately 50 million in additional fees associated with prior periods attributed to a retrospective price increase from a renegotiated contract entered into during the year ended december 31 2019 as well as the cumulative impact of price and volume increases the increase in revenues from assetbased fees was also driven by higher revenues from etfs linked to msci indexes which was driven by a 76 increase in average aum partially offset by the impact of a change in product mix in addition the increase in revenues from assetbased fees was driven by higher revenues from nonetf passive products linked to msci indexes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from assetbased fees was negligible

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 27 to 2950 million compared to 2873 million for the year ended december 31 2018 reflecting increases across the index and the all other reportable segments the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to 70 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus and higher incentive compensation partially offset by lower wages and salaries as well as increases in noncompensation costs including professional fees

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 137 to 2193 million compared to 1929 million for the year ended december 31 2018 reflecting increases in all three reportable segments the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries 45 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus and higher severance costs as well as increases in noncompensation costs including marketing costs professional fees and recruiting costs

research and development

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 208 to 983 million compared to 814 million for the year ended december 31 2018 reflecting higher investments across all three reportable segments the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs which includes an insignificant amount of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus additionally there were increases in noncompensation costs including professional fees information technology costs occupancy costs recruiting costs and travel and entertainment costs

general and administrative

ga expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 102 to 1101 million compared to 999 million for the year ended december 31 2018 reflecting increases across all three reportable segments the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs primarily relating to higher wages and salaries and 35 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus offset in part by lower incentive compensation

the following table presents operating expenses using compensation and noncompensation categories rather than using activity categories

 



 

compensation and benefits costs are our most significant expense and typically represent more than 60 of operating expenses or more than 70 of adjusted ebitda expenses we had 3396 employees as of december 31 2019 compared to 3112 employees as of december 31 2018 reflecting a 91 growth in the number of employees continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs as of december 31 2019 629 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 614 as of december 31 2018

 

compensation and benefits costs for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 100 to 5187 million compared to 4717 million for the year ended december 31 2018 driven by 154 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 m ulti y ear p sus higher severance costs incentive compensation wages and salaries and benefit costs 

noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 74 to 2040 million compared to 1899 million for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily driven by higher costs relating to professional fees information technology costs recruiting costs travel and entertainment costs marketing and personnel related costs 

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets expense for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 88 to 494 million compared to 542 million for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily driven by the absence of amortization following the writeoff of the ipd trade name used by the real estate segment in june 2018 and the october 2018 investorforce divestiture partially offset by higher amortization of internallydeveloped capitalized software

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 300 million and 313 million respectively 

other expense income net

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 1673 to 1524 million compared to 570 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily driven by the absence of the 466 million and 106 million of gains realized from the investorforce and fea divestitures respectively which occurred in 2018 the increase was also driven by the 168 million loss on extinguishment associated with the partial prematurity redemption of the 2024 senior notes which included approximately 131 million of call premium paid in accordance with the redemption prices set forth in the indenture and the writeoff of approximately 37 million of unamortized costs associated with the 2024 senior notes in addition the increase also reflects higher interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt and higher foreign currency exchange losses

income taxes

the provision for income tax decreased 675 to 397 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 1220 million for the year ended december 31 2018 these amounts reflect effective tax rates of 66 and 194 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the effective tax rate of 66 for the year ended december 31 2019 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling 857 million these discrete items primarily relate to 666 million of excess tax benefits recognized upon vesting of the 2016 multiyear psus and 161 million of excess tax benefits on other sharebased compensation recognized during the period in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by a beneficial geographic mix of earnings 

the effective tax rate of 194 for the year ended december 31 2018 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling 319 million these discrete items include 88 million of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 119 million related to the release of valuation allowances previously recorded on capital loss carryforwards and 112 million related to the final impact of tax reform

operating metrics

run rate

“run rate” estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements “client contracts” for the next 12 months assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volumefees the run rate calculation reflects for etfs the market value on the last trading day of the period for futures and options the most recent quarterly volumes andor reported exchange fees and for other nonetf products the most recent clientreported assets run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales whether to existing or new clients when we execute client contracts even though the license start date and associated revenue recognition may not be effective until a later date we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services even though such notice is not effective until a later date

 

changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in run rate the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate for numerous reasons including 





















the following table presents run rates by reportable segment as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated

 



 

total run rate grew 142 to 16345 million as of december 31 2019 compared to 14313 million as of december 31 2018 recurring subscription run rate grew 106 to 12383 million as of december 31 2019 compared to 11194 million as of december 31 2018 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscription run rate would have increased 106 as of december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 

 

run rate from assetbased fees increased 270 to 3961 million as of december 31 2019 from 3119 million as of december 31 2018 driven by higher aum in etfs linked to msci indexes as well as higher aum in nonetf passive funds also linked to msci indexes and higher fees in futures and options as of december 31 2019 the value of aum in etfs linked to msci indexes was 9344 billion up 2388 billion or 343 from 6956 billion as of december 31 2018 the increase of 2388 billion consisted of net inflows of 913 billion and a market appreciation of 1475 billion partially offsetting the impact of the increase in aum in etfs linked to msci indexes was a change in product mix which was the primary driver of a decline in average basis point fees to 282 at december 31 2019 from 292 at december 31 2018 

index recurring subscription run rate grew 113 to 5593 million as of december 31 2019 compared to 5027 million as of december 31 2018 primarily driven by strong growth in core developed and emerging market modules and factor esg and custom index products with strong growth across our asset management clients and growth across our banking hedge fund wealth management and asset owner clients

run rate from analytics products increased 71 to 5268 million as of december 31 2019 compared to 4919 million as of december 31 2018 primarily driven by strong growth in both multiasset class and equity analytics products adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations analytics run rate would have increased 72 as of december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018

run rate from all other products increased 219 to 1522 million at december 31 2019 compared to 1249 million at december 31 2018 the 274 million increase was primarily driven by a 219 million or 276 increase in esg run rate to 1014 million and a 54 million or 120 increase in real estate run rate to 508 million the increase in esg run rate was primarily driven by strong growth in esg ratings products and esg screening products the increase in real estate run rate was primarily driven by growth in market information products adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations all other run rate would have increased 217 esg run rate would have increased 276 and real estate run rate would have increased 113 at december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 

 

 

subscription sales 

the following table presents our recurring subscription sales cancellations and nonrecurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated

 



 



 

retention rate 

another key metric is our “retention rate” the following table presents our retention rate by reportable segment and product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

 



 

retention rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time the annual retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year 

the retention rate for a nonannual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew during the nonannual period and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the period 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded cancellations of 199 million to derive the retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 199 million to derive 797 million of annualized cancellations this 797 million was then divided by the 11194 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 71 the 71 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive a retention rate of 929 for the fourth quarter 

retention rate is computed by operating segment on a productservicebyproductservice basis in general if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment or switches between products or services within a segment we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our retention rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service in those replacement cases only the net change to the client subscription if a decrease is reported as a cancel in the analytics and the esg segments substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner while in our index and real estate segments product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a downsale of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in indexlinked investment products or futures and options contracts in each case linked to our indexes 

for the year ended december 31 2019 333 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter in our product lines retention rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities in addition we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets we intend to use these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

senior notes and credit agreement

we have an aggregate of 31000 million in senior unsecured notes collectively the “senior notes” consisting of five discrete private placement offerings and entered into a 4000 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks see note 5 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement

the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by our direct or indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5 of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated assets other than certain excluded subsidiaries the “subsidiary guarantors” amounts due under the revolving credit agreement are our and the subsidiary guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the senior notes and any of our other unsecured unsubordinated debt senior to any of our subordinated debt and effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt

the indentures governing our senior notes the “indentures” among us each of the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets in addition the indentures restrict our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create assume incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such nonguarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the senior notes on a pari passu basis

the revolving credit agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that among other things limit our ability and the ability of our existing or future subsidiaries to

























 





the revolving credit agreement and the indentures also contain customary events of default including those relating to nonpayment breach of representations warranties or covenants crossdefault and crossacceleration bankruptcy and insolvency events invalidity or impairment of loan documentation or collateral change of control and customary erisa defaults none of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business

the revolving credit agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the revolving credit agreement 1 the maximum consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 425100 and 2 the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 400100 as of december 31 2019 our consolidated leverage ratio was 330100 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 642100 there have been no amounts drawn under the revolving credit agreement since it was entered into on november 20 2014 

our nonguarantor subsidiaries of the senior notes consist of i domestic subsidiaries of the company that account for 5 or less of consolidated assets of the company and its subsidiaries and ii any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the company that is deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our nonguarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately 8834 million or 567 of our total revenue for the 12 months ended december 31 2019 approximately 2670 million or 353 of our consolidated operating income for the 12 months ended december 31 2019 and approximately 9101 million or 216 of our consolidated total assets excluding intercompany assets and 6243 million or 146 of our consolidated total liabilities in each case as of december 31 2019

share repurchases

the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company’s common stock in the open market see note 10 “shareholders’ equity deficit” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program

cash flows 

the following table presents the company’s cash and cash equivalents as of the dates indicated

 



 

the following table presents the breakdown of the company’s cash flows for the periods indicated

 



 

cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents were 15066 million and 9042 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately 2000 million to 2500 million for general operating purposes as of december 31 2019 and 2018 3212 million and 2756 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries as a result of tax reform we can now more efficiently access a significant portion of our cash held outside of the us in the shortterm without being subject to us income taxes repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purpose or other needs including acquisitions or expansion of our products

cash flows from operating activities

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 7095 million and 6128 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers and the benefit of lower payments for income taxes partially offset by higher payments for cash expenses and interest

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs market data costs interest expenses and income taxes historically the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year

cash flows from investing activities

cash used in investing activities was 719 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 349 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the yearoveryear change was primarily driven by the absence of the proceeds received from the investorforce and fea divestitures in 2018 and the acquisition payment of carbon delta 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 367 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 6265 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the yearoveryear change primarily reflects lower share repurchases and the proceeds from the 10000 million 2029 senior notes offering in november 2019 partially offset by the payment for the prematurity r edemption or repurchase of the 5000 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 senior notes and higher dividend payments 

we believe that global cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect that foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

 

contractual obligations

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31 2019

 



 





the obligations related to our uncertain tax positions which are not considered material have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2019 and 2018 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

foreign currency risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollarreported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 135 and 129 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 135 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2019 408 was in euros 269 was in japanese yen and 231 was in british pounds sterling of the 129 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2018 422 was in euros 294 was in japanese yen and 178 was in british pounds sterling 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 232 and 235 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 412 and 404 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees hungarian forints euros hong kong dollars swiss francs and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 40 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and foreign currency exchange gains of 04 million for the year ended december 31 2018

risks related to our business 

we are dependent on third parties to supply data and software for our products and are dependent on certain vendors to distribute our data a refusal by a key vendor to distribute our data or any loss of key outside suppliers of data or software products or reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data or products or any failure by us to comply with our vendors’ licensing requirements could impair our ability to provide our clients with the data products or services they desire which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we rely on the accuracy and quality of thirdparty data and software products and depend on the ability and willingness of thirdparty data and software providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes to produce and deliver our products provide services and develop new products and services additionally we rely on certain thirdparty vendors to distribute our data to clients while some of our vendors generate revenue in connection with distributing our data others do not derive a direct financial benefit should any of our key vendors refuse to distribute our data for any reason we would need to find alternative ways to distribute our data which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if the data and software products from our suppliers have errors are delayed have design defects become incompatible with future versions of our products are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all we may not be able to deliver our products and services and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as of december 31 2018 we relied on the data of over 200 suppliers including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world

many of our data and software suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of the provision of data by one or more of our significant data suppliers or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the information available for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we also monitor our use of thirdparty data and software products to comply with applicable licensing requirements despite our efforts our use of certain thirdparty data and software products has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased data acquisition or software costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by data or software that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty data or software products increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other data or software are substantial and we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent data or software products if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an indexlinked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the us our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products including etfs mutual funds and institutional accounts managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant product’s total expense ratio “ter” additionally competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide indexlinked investment products including etfs the fees providers of indexlinked investment products charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these managers with some providers seeking to win or retain business by charging their clients lower fees as noted above in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in an investment product’s ter a reduction in the ter or an elimination of ter may negatively impact our revenues additionally our clients including our largest clients may seek to lower or eliminate aum floors ie minimum assetbased fee percentages or impose or lower aum ceilings ie maximum assetbased fee percentages such changes in our fee structure could individually or in the aggregate negatively impact our revenues 

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or switch to a lower fee index for example at least one large client ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds additionally clients that license our indexes to serve as the basis for listed futures and options contracts might discontinue such contracts we have a differentiated licensing strategy for our indexes and from time to time experience faster growth in lower fee product areas resulting in a lower average assetbased fee percentage for licensing our indexes while we look to maximize the price and volume tradeoff over the longterm there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in aum in indexlinked investment products with lower than average product fees not sufficiently offset by growth in aum in indexlinked investment products in higher than average product fees in the instances described above our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients multiple kinds of indexlinked investment products based on the same indexes a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the use of the same index as the basis of another type of product

if we are required to offer clients materially lower assetbased fee percentages with respect to indexlinked investment products that generate fees based on the assets of such products or our largest clients cease to use our indexes our revenues could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our business may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets and is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities as well as the measurement of the performance of their equity investment against equity benchmarks if investment in equity markets declines revenue attributable to our clients’ use of our indexes or analytics products could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios our equity indexes serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments and are also used by clients as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds for a fee based on the value of the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues for example cash inflows into an etf may be offset by a decline in the performance of the etf and vice versa assetbased fees accounted for 235 and 217 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively these assetbased fees accounted 

for 561 and 555 of the total revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

our analytics segment offers performance attribution and portfolio management content applications and services that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return of their equity portfolios additionally equity models developed in our analytics segment are used to construct msci factor indexes a move away from equity investing could decrease demand for such products

volatile capital markets which may impact whether investors choose to invest in developed or emerging markets or in the us or nonus markets as well as changing investment styles among other factors may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product or lead clients to significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our equity indexes could decrease while we offer products and services to both active and passive investment managers an economic trend that significantly favors active investment could lead to decreased demand for indexlinked investment products or equity based investment strategies which could decrease our revenues accordingly the value of assets in indexlinked investment products can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if we are unable to offset the impact of decreased revenues associated with our indexes and analytics products including by managing our operating costs our profitability could be materially adversely affected see “— our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” below 

any resulting failures disruptions or instability of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems or the internet including a cybersecurity breach or cyberattack may result in reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and their components including our data centers and the internet to seamlessly provide clients with products and customer service heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized changes tampering intrusions or hacking human error cyberterrorism cybercrime ransomware terrorist attacks affecting sites where we are located natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures technical breakdowns internet failures or computer viruses could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns occur with respect to our operations including to our information technology platform our electronic delivery systems or the internet our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services or to whom we distribute index and constituent data on a real time basis that is used to manage funds that replicate msci indexes may be materially adversely affected for example we have in recent years experienced denialofservice attacks while we have been able to defend our systems against such disruptions and attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans will be effective in mitigating the risks and costs associated with the particular event that has occurred while we have and continue to invest in risk management and information security measures including employee training disaster recovery and business continuity plans the total cost of ongoing development and implementation may increase over time given enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cybersecurity breaches although we currently estimate that the total cost of ongoing development and implementation of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

any material breaches of cybersecurity or thirdparty reports of perceived security vulnerability to the company’s systems even if no breach has occurred could cause the company to suffer reputational harm loss of 

customers and revenue regulatory actions and scrutiny litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing could lead to unexpected or higher than estimated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of data could adversely affect our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” below   

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of data could adversely affect our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including sensitive and confidential client data such as material nonpublic information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized data access or disclosure the company may also be exposed to more targeted cyberattacks aimed at accessing certain information on our systems because of our prominence in the global marketplace including client data our esg ratings of corporate issuers and the composition of our indexes as a result of increased cyber threats and cybersecurity and privacy regulations clients have increasingly requested additional security measures on the products we provide and details about our internal processes and software controls policies and procedures related to security processing integrity and confidentiality or privacy such requests may increase our cost of implementation and expose us to additional cybersecurity risks if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or additional security measures requested by clients if we experience cyberattacks that lead to a security or data privacy breach or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of data could occur additionally while we believe our internal controls policies and procedures are currently adequate in protecting the confidentiality of data breaches of confidentiality may still occur as a result of human error particularly in connection with a more manual process for processing such data 

such breaches unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation may result in claims against us by our clients or regulatory inquiry or censure which could individually or in the aggregate damage our brand and reputation andor have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures or a cyberattack results in a security or data privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “ — changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial or operational regulations or the repeal of existing financial or operational regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” below

migration of our applications and infrastructure to new technologies data centers and software could result in unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of our products which could impair our ability to provide clients with products and customer service such impairment may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products after we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers while we have taken steps to mitigate such interruptions and delays we cannot provide assurance that they will not occur again in the future even after extensive testing of new software and hardware we could also experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services due to such interruptions and delays which may result in decreased revenues we may also experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products after adopting new technologies and software including cloud computing virtualization and agile software development in place of more traditional methods of development and support we may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from and defend against such disruptions and attacks accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems or the internet 

may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses failures or breaches 

we have confidentiality and conflict of interest policies in place regarding index composition decisions and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of any material nonpublic information regarding changes to and the integrity of our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies conflict of interest policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

we change the composition of our indexes from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our equity indexes can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indexes our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have confidentiality policies in place and have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes relating to our equity indexes these policies are designed to limit dissemination of information not only between msci and the rest of the world but also within msci we have conflict of interest policies in place to ensure that employees act with integrity including not putting their own personal interests or financial gain above the interests of the company and our clients if our confidentiality policies conflict of interest policies or information barrier procedures fail or we are delayed in implementing such procedures as necessary with respect to a newly acquired business and an employee inadvertently discloses or deliberately misuses material nonpublic information related to one of our indexes in violation of such policies our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our confidentiality policies conflict of interest policies or information barrier policies and procedures could negatively impact our brand or reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

certain exchanges permit our clients to list indexlinked investment products based on our equity indexes only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have information barrier procedures in place designed to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information related to our equity indexes if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our equity indexes which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

rapidly increasing competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face rapidly increasing competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product some competitors may offer price incentives or different pricing structures that are more attractive to clients to expand their market share and may also consolidate with one another or form joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies resulting from an expanded suite of products and services

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many of the markets for our products and services including for singlepurpose product companies low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example more brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes recent developments including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information advances in cloud computing and the increase in open source code as well as proprietary software in specific areas such as pricing high volume computing orchestration layers for services and visualization have increasingly 

allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further 

financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic conditions may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer providers by consolidating with other clients or by selfsourcing certain of their informational needs accordingly competitive and market pressures may result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses including as a result of client closures and consolidations price reductions prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an indexlinked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above and part i item 1 “business—competition” above

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage transitions and product integrations failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of this industry and the impact of technological change on our products and services we must continually introduce new products and services enhance existing products and services including through integration of products and services within msci and with thirdparty platforms and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services if among other things we fail to accurately anticipate or respond or adapt to evolving technologies and changing industry standards if we fail to anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients or cannot be integrated with thirdparty platforms if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated if we misprice our new products and services if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely or if competitors in any business line introduce products services systems and processes that are more competitive than ours or that gain greater market acceptance we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results for example we have made and need to continue to make investments in our technology platform in order to provide competitive products and services to our clients from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also present execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see “— if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” below

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

as of december 31 2018 and 2017 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 286 and 278 of our total revenues respectively our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing subscription base and our investment product licenses failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business 

financial condition and operating results for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 119 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 958 and 953 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs that are based on our indexes a contract with blackrock from which we derive a material portion of our revenues has a term which ends in march 2020 with autorenewal for successive oneyear periods unless either party provides advanced written notice of termination if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see also “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an indexlinked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past if we experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs regulatory compliance costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs application development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other costs and we cannot adjust to these costs our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected

additionally there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development marketing efforts or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “— to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage transitions and product integrations failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge skills experience and abilities of our employees accordingly we believe that the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key management research and product development sales and marketing product management operations information technology and other personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if our cash and longterm equity incentive compensation programs do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our customers and achieve business objectives may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

any future expansion may place significant strain on our management and other resources

our expansion in the past and any future expansion particularly in emerging market locations has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial human resources management legal and compliance processes and 

information systems to keep pace with the prior expansion of our business there can also be no assurance that if in the future we expand organically or by way of acquisition our management will be effective in attracting engaging and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing expansion additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses ” below “— we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected ” above part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below 

changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial or operational regulations or the repeal of existing financial or operational regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly these regulations are complex evolve frequently and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could materially adversely affect our business it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties additionally we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws rules or regulations in various jurisdictions which could individually or in the aggregate result in materially higher compliance costs to us it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license and price our products or could impose additional costs on us some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could restrict our clients’ ability to use our products and services unless we change our products and services or could otherwise impact our clients’ demand for our products and services as such to the extent that our clients become bound by certain laws rules or regulations we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services at their request even in instances where we are not directly legally bound to the extent that we rely on our clients and vendors to provide data for our products and services and certain laws rules or regulations impact our clients’ and vendors’ ability or willingness to provide that data to us or regulate the fees for which such data can be provided our ability to continue to produce our products and services or the related costs could be negatively impacted there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the regulations that most materially impact us are described below



there is also uncertainty as to how the uk’s access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results because we have significant operations in europe and certain members 

of our senior management team are based in london for example changes in labor and tax laws which increase the cost to our staff of living and working in the uk or the eu in particular changes that result in increased tax obligations or changes in immigration regulations may impact the ability to hire and retain nonuk staff in the uk or uk staff in the eu see also “— we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities in various jurisdictions” below   a dditionally any changes to the passporting or other regulations relating to doing business in various eu countries by relying on a regulatory permission in the uk or doing business in the uk by relying on a regulatory permission in an eu country could increase our costs of doing business or our ability to do so a change in such regulations or other regulations could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases affect our ability to do business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

regulation eu 20161011 on indexes used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds was published on june 30 2016 with effect on january 1 2018 with a twoyear transition period until january 1 2020 the regulation governs index development calculation dissemination governance maintenance and recordkeeping as well as input data licensing collection and dissemination additionally the european securities and markets authority “esma” issues guidance from time to time regarding interpretations of the regulation and new proposals to amend the benchmark regulation are in process on march 5 2018 msci limited a subsidiary of msci inc was granted authorization by the united kingdom financial conduct authority as a uk administrator for all msci equity indexes the company is currently implementing the eu benchmark regulation for a limited set of the uk msci private real estate indexes 

under the markets in financial instruments regulation regulation eu no 6002014 where the value of a financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark will be required to ensure that clearing entities and trading venues may license the benchmark and receive relevant price and data feeds and information regarding the composition methodology and pricing of the benchmark for the purposes of clearing and trading access to such licenses and information will have to be offered by the benchmark owner within three months of the request and on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms that are no less favorable than the terms offered to other trading venues unless a different basis can be objectively justified compliance with this regulation is required by january 1 2020 

on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en which are updated from time to time by esma “guidelines” the guidelines limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines 

on july 17 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published its final report on principles for financial benchmarks “iosco principles” the iosco principles cover conflicts of interest benchmark quality and integrity methodology requirements procedures related to handling complaints documentation requirements and audit reviews the iosco principles require benchmark administrators to publicly disclose whether they comply with the iosco principles within 

12 months of their initial publication with such compliance subject to audit we announced our implementation of the iosco principles on july 16 2014 and posted our adherence statements and audit results on our website in each of july 2014 2015 and 2016 in 2017 we used those resources to implement the regulation eu 20161011 and continued to rely on our 2016 adherence statements and audit results we posted our explanatory note and updates arising from our implementation of the regulation eu 20161011 in december 2017 for 2018 for our equity indexes we posted our iosco adherence statement on our website in december 2018 and for our real estate indexes we continue to rely on our 2017 approach as we continue to implement the regulation eu 20161011 

additionally on january 3 2018 under the markets in financial instruments regulation regulation eu no 6002014 rules became effective in the eu that require sellside firms to unbundle the costs of research and separately charge buyside firms for execution investment research and other advisory services msci is not such a firm and we rely on our clients to determine whether their use of our products and services falls within the definition of investment research and from which budget our fees are to be paid the impact of these decisions on our clients’ budgets and the ongoing uncertainty around the application of the rules has led to and could continue to lead to delays in the execution of agreements and the potential loss of revenue in the eu specifically for certain of our esg research products 









in some instances in connection with the provision of data and services we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject to the extent that our clients are subject to increased regulation we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us for example a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage for example on september 20 2016 blackrock received exemptive relief from the sec to create certain indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage similarly some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products or services unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products or services may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations a growing number of asset managers and investment banks in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services or acting together with an industry group or association have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs structured products or overthecounter derivatives see “— a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above and “— increased competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” above

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon their intellectual property rights which in each case could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets patents copyrights and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and services there is no guarantee that any trade secrets patents copyrights or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights and the number of these claims may grow these intellectual property claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages limit our future use of certain technologies may harm our reputation and prevent us from offering some services or products 

pursuing intellectual property claims or responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time and result in costly litigation or delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop providing or using the affected products or services or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours also some elements of our products and services may not be subject to intellectual property protection









likewise we cannot be certain that we are aware or in the future will be aware of every instance in which this sort of behavior may occur additionally the enforceability of our license and other agreements’ nondisclosure obligations and the availability of remedies to us in the event of a breach may vary due to the many different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located







our use of open source code could introduce security vulnerabilities into our internal network system impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims the quality of the code or the security of the code despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system through security patches and software updates we are still vulnerable to cyberattacks launched by those seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in such code such cyberattacks could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary applications with open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage additionally the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form portions of our proprietary code to reengineer our products or systems to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely or costeffective basis or to take other remedial action that could divert resources away from our development efforts any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our products and services support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing use of our products or services as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients the parties whose assets are managed by our clients or the companies that we rate or assess in our esg segment may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts based on what may be alleged to be even a small error in our data methodologies or analysis or malfunction in certain of our products or services 

errors or defects can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current clients our current and future products may contain errors in our data methodologies or analysis serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product or publish a methodology or analysis we might have to delay the product or index release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our new 

or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements or corrections to address such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to do so if undetected errors exist in our products data methodologies or analysis or if our products fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our brand or reputation lost sales delays in commercial release third party claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors additionally any undetected errors defects malfunctions or similar problems in our products data methodologies or analysis could lead to significant failures disruptions or slowdowns with respect to our product delivery to clients the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations see “— any resulting failures disruptions or instability of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems or the internet including a cybersecurity breach or cyberattack may result in reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

while we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or services or delay or failure to provide services these provisions do not always eliminate liability resulting from the occurrence of any of these events entirely and may have certain exceptions that could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws any such claims brought against us even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult if not impossible to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize synergies from acquisitions or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions our financial results may be materially adversely affected

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions as we continue pursuing selective acquisitions to support our growth strategy we seek to be a disciplined acquirer and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices in addition our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into our business we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses or that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate in addition our past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt our operations any acquisition could present a number of risks including incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets failure to achieve assumed synergies or successful integration of operations and management increased debt associated with acquisitions dilution of our common stock loss of key personnel and diversion of management’s attention from existing operations

in the event that we experience a high level of acquisitionrelated activity within a limited period of time the probability that these risks would occur would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk see part ii item 7a “—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency risk”

we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations depending on the final terms reached between the uk and the eu brexit has and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling the weaker british pound sterling means that revenues earned in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar revenues the weaker british pound sterling also means that expenses incurred in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar expenses the weaker british pound sterling could also impair the purchasing power of our clients and could result in decreased demand for our products and services the fall in the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar and the strengthening of the us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling could have significant impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2018 we had 26 billion of outstanding indebtedness in the form of senior unsecured notes collectively the “senior notes” we completed a private offering of 8000 million aggregate principal amount of 525 senior unsecured notes due 2024 the “2024 senior notes” on november 20 2014 a private offering of 8000 million aggregate principal amount of 575 senior unsecured notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” on august 13 2015 a private offering of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 475 senior unsecured notes due 2026 the “2026 senior notes” on august 4 2016 and a private offering of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 5375 senior unsecured notes due 2027 the “2027 senior notes” on may 18 2018 

we also maintain a 2500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement the “revolving credit agreement” which was undrawn as of december 31 2018 the revolving credit agreement is subject to an unused commitment fee of 030 we recognized an interest expense associated with the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement of approximately 1331 million for the year ended december 31 2018

although we believe that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or access offshore cash we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity and we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all absent sufficient cash flow from our operations and the ability to refinance we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements however limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected

we may need to incur substantial additional debt from time to time under our existing debt agreements to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify including by making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness

furthermore the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit among other things our and our existing and future subsidiaries’ financial flexibility if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default that in some cases if continuing could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under our revolving credit agreement see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for a description of the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 

a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition

our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt our outstanding debt under the senior notes currently has a noninvestment grade rating any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by such agency if in the agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant such future circumstances include but are not limited to adverse changes to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage for example on july 28 2015 the board of directors authorized corporate action that led to a change in the company’s target leverage and interest expense allowing for the issuance of our 2025 senior notes on august 13 2015 following the board of directors’ authorization one of the ratings agencies described the increase as substantially higher than current leverage levels and as a result downgraded our credit rating this downgrade and any further downgrade could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain

in addition our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating the senior notes contain covenants that require the company to offer to repurchase the 2024 senior notes the 2025 senior notes the 2026 senior notes or the 2027 senior notes as applicable in cash at a price equal to 1010 of their par value in the event of a change of control of the company or disposition of substantially all of the company’s assets the company is obligated to make such repurchase offer to noteholders if the following two conditions are met at the time of or as a result of such change of control or asset sale transaction i the senior notes are rated below investment grade by each rating agency that rates the senior notes and ii the senior notes are downgraded by any rating agency

any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms accordingly actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the us and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and esg and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the us there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries

we may be exposed to liabilities as a result of failure to comply with anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or benefits or offers of payments or benefits to foreign governments and their officials and in some cases to employees of a business for the purpose of directing obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than fully effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities in various jurisdictions

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome or indirect taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate in particular brexit could create uncertainty with respect to our corporate tax rate as well as the tax rates of our employees based in the uk 

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth withholding property and goods and services taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities

future changes in tax law could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” was enacted on december 22 2017 and significantly affected us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations 

tax reform requires complex computations not previously provided in us tax law further compliance with tax reform and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced our 2018 financial statements reflect the final adjustments to the provisional estimate of tax reform based on our interpretations of the current guidance however tax reform could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and may impact our results of operations in the period issued

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 18266 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2018 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable these impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired

in connection with our initial public offering and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant

our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the fullyear financial guidance or longterm targets that we provide publicly 

we provide fullyear financial guidance and longterm targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance for example we provide assumptions regarding our ability to manage our expenses generate free cash flow achieve a certain effective tax rate and achieve our profitability targets while we believe that our annual financial guidance and longterm targets provide investors and analysts with insight to our view of the company’s future performance such financial guidance and longterm targets are based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results if we fail to meet the fullyear financial guidance or achieve the longterm targets that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year or longterm targets over time the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us in the ordinary course of business while the amounts claimed could be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainty that exists therefore it is possible that our business operating results financial condition or cash flows in a particular period could be materially adversely affected by certain contingencies however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of matters that are currently pending or asserted will not individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows

overview

we are a leading provider of missioncritical investment decision support tools and services — we power investors to make better decisions about their investment portfolios our tools and services help investors better understand the drivers of risk and return and build portfolios to more effectively and efficiently achieve their investment objectives we are able to do this by leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research data and technology in order to deliver actionable solutions to our clients we are dynamic and flexible in the delivery of our content and capabilities such as our indexes portfolio construction tools and riskmanagement services esg research and ratings and real estate benchmarks return analytics services and market insights much of which can be accessed by our clients through multiple channels and platforms

our clients comprise a wide spectrum of the global investment industry and include the following key client segments asset owners pension funds endowments foundations central banks sovereign wealth funds family offices and insurance companies asset managers institutional mutual funds hedge funds etfs insurance private wealth private banks and real estate investment trusts financial intermediaries banks brokerdealers exchanges custodians trust companies and investment consultants and wealth managers including an increasing number of “roboadvisors”

through a combined use of the content and capabilities provided by each of our operating segments — index analytics esg and real estate — our clients gain a broad view of the global investment industry which enables them to manage their investment objectives across multiple asset classes in an increasingly integrated manner

as of december 31 2018 we had over 7000 clients across 90 countries to calculate the number of clients we use the shipping address of the ultimate customer utilizing the product which counts affiliates user locations or business units within a single organization as separate clients if we aggregate all related clients under their respective parent entity the number of clients would be over 4000 as of december 31 2018 as of december 31 2018 we had offices in 31 cities in 21 countries to help serve our diverse client base with 502 of our revenues coming from clients in the americas 354 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 144 in asia and australia 

our principal business model is generally to license annual recurring subscriptions for the majority of our index analytics and esg products and services for a fee due in advance of the service period we also license annual recurring subscriptions for the majority of our real estate products for a fee which is primarily paid in arrears after the product is delivered with the exception of the market information product for which the fees are generally paid in advance recurring fees may vary based on a number of factors including by product or service number of users or volume of services our recurring client contracts do not have a financing component and the consideration received is typically not variable a portion of our fees are variable and comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee typically in arrears primarily based on the aum in their investment products and these fees are typically variable we also have variable fees from certain exchanges that use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us in arrears primarily based on the volume of trades or number of instruments we also realize onetime fees commonly related to customized reports historical data sets certain derivative financial products and certain implementation and consulting services as well as from particular products and services that are purchased on a nonrenewal basis

 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue and profit growth including results accounted for under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” as well as nongaap measures for the company as a whole and by operating segment in addition we focus on operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and retention rate to manage the business our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our profits into excess cash in the future our growth strategy includes a expanding leadership in researchenhanced content b strengthening existing and new client relationships by providing solutions c improving access to our solutions through cuttingedge technology and platforms d expanding valueadded service offerings and e executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies 

 

key financial metrics and drivers

as discussed in the previous section we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company including gaap and nongaap measures as detailed below we review revenues by type and by segment or major product line we also review expenses by activity which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed in addition we utilize operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business

in the discussion that follows we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period while operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes assetbased fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the underlying aum which is the primary component of assetbased fees is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations approximately twothirds of the aum are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and accordingly any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency adjusted variances

revenues

our revenues are characterized by type which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned our revenue types are recurring subscription assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment see part 1 item 1 “business—our operating segments” above for additional details on the products and services that we offer

recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements and are recognized in most cases ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date 

assetbased fees represent fees earned on the aum linked to our indexes from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client assetbased fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes which are primarily based on trading volumes

nonrecurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts and primarily include revenues for providing historical data certain implementation services and other special client requests 

effective january 1 2018 msci adopted the new revenue standard as set forth under asc subtopic 60610 “revenue from contracts with customers” see note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation— significant accounting policies — revenue recognition ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on our revenue recognition policy

operating expenses 

we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories













costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or when not directly attributable an estimate is allocated based on the type of effort involved

cost of revenues

cost of revenues consists of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs including data center platform and infrastructure costs costs to acquire produce and maintain market data information costs of research to support and maintain existing products costs of product management teams costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources finance and legal costs

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales force and marketing teams as well as costs incurred in other groups associated with acquiring new business including product management research technology and sales operations

research and development

rd expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and the costs to develop new or improved technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development research product management project management and the technology support associated with these efforts

general and administrative

ga expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations human resources office of the ceo legal corporate technology corporate development and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed but are instead allocated to a product or service

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definitelived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and internal capitalized software projects intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships trademarks and trade names technology and software proprietary processes and data and noncompetition agreements we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values we have no indefinitelived intangible assets

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets

other expense income net

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items

nongaap financial measures

adjusted ebitda

“adjusted ebitda” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as net income before 1 provision for income taxes 2 other expense income net 3 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 4 amortization of intangible assets and at times 5 certain other transactions or adjustments

“adjusted ebitda expenses” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and at times certain other transactions or adjustments

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures of the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant onetime unusual or nonrecurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company’s core operating performance in the period all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on among other things longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments accordingly the company’s computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies

run rate

run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our operating revenues over time at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” see “— operating metrics — run rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

subscription sales

subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — subscription sales ” below for additional information

retention rate

another key operating metric is retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — retention rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected see note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation— significant accounting policies ” and note 2 “recent accounting standards updates” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a listing of our accounting policies

 

factors affecting the comparability of results

divestitures

on august 1 2016 we completed the divestiture of our real estate occupiers business which was included as a component of the all other segment through the date of divestiture the value of the disposed assets and liabilities and the resulting gain on disposal were not material to the company 

on april 9 2018 we completed the divestiture of fea for 210 million in cash which resulted in a gain of 106 million fea was included as a component of the analytics segment through the date of divestiture the results of operations from fea were not material to the company 

on october 12 2018 we completed the divestiture of investorforce and received 628 million in cash subject to a working capital adjustment which resulted in a gain of 466 million investorforce was included as a component of the analytics segment through the date of divestiture the results of operations from investorforce were not material to the company 

share repurchases

the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company’s common stock see note 9 “shareholders’ equity deficit” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program

 

for the year ended december 31 2016 the company repurchased approximately 103 million shares at an average price of 7371 per share for a total value of 7594 million pursuant to open market repurchases

 

for the year ended december 31 2017 the company repurchased approximately 16 million shares at an average price of 8796 per share for a total value of 1369 million pursuant to open market repurchases

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 the company repurchased approximately 62 million shares at an average price of 14834 per share for a total value of 9250 million pursuant to open market repurchases

the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate our diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 24 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 and by 48 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the decreases in both periods primarily reflect the impact of share repurchases made pursuant to the 2016 and 2018 repurchase programs partially offset by the impact of higher dilution primarily caused by restricted stock units for which the ultimate payout is tied to the achievement of multiyear total shareholder return targets  

senior notes and credit agreement

we have issued an aggregate of 26 billion in senior notes and entered into a 250 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks see “–liquidity and capital resources–senior notes and credit agreement” below and note 5 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017

operating metrics

run rate

“run rate” estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements “client contracts” for the next 12 months assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volumefees the run rate calculation reflects for etfs the market value on the last trading day of the period for futures and options the most recent quarterly volumes andor reported exchange fees and for other nonetf products the most recent clientreported assets run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales whether to existing or new clients when we execute client contracts even though the license start date and associated revenue recognition may not be effective until a later date we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services even though such notice is not effective until a later date

changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in run rate the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate for numerous reasons including

december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017 

total run rate grew 48 to 14313 million as of december 31 2018 compared to 13657 million as of december 31 2017 recurring subscription run rate grew 67 to 11194 million as of december 31 2018 compared to 10489 million as of december 31 2017 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscription run rate would have increased 73 as of december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017 

run rate from assetbased fees decreased 15 to 3119 million as of december 31 2018 from 3168 million as of december 31 2017 primarily driven by lower aum in etfs partially offset by increases in nonetf passive funds and futures and options contracts all linked to msci indexes as of december 31 2018 the value of aum in etfs linked to msci indexes was 6956 billion down 487 billion or 65 from 7443 billion as of december 31 2017 the decrease of 487 billion consisted of market depreciation of asset values of 1102 billion partially offset by net inflows of 615 billion

run rate from all other products increased 152 to 1249 million at december 31 2018 compared to 1084 million at december 31 2017 the 165 million increase was primarily driven by a 148 million or 230 increase in esg run rate to 795 million and a 16 million or 37 increase in real estate run rate to 454 million the increase in esg run rate was primarily driven by strong growth in esg ratings products and an

subscription sales 

the following table presents our recurring subscription sales cancellations and nonrecurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated

 



 

retention rate

another key metric is our “retention rate” the following table presents our retention rate by reportable segment and product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016

  



 

retention rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time the annual retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year 

the retention rate for a nonannual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew during the nonannual period and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the period 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded cancellations of 182 million to derive the retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 182 million to derive 727 million of annualized cancellations this 727 million was then divided by the 10489 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 69 the 69 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive a retention rate of 931 for the fourth quarter 

retention rate is computed by operating segment on a productservicebyproductservice basis in general if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment or switches between products or services within a segment we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our retention rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service in those replacement cases only the net change to the client subscription if a decrease is reported as a cancel in the analytics and the esg segments substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner while in our index and real estate segments product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a downsale of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in indexlinked investment products or futures and options contracts in each case linked to our indexes 

this definition of retention rate was revised and was previously provided in our quarterly report on form 10q filed with the sec on august 3 2018 to describe our methodology for calculating cancellations we believe this 

methodology has been applied in all material respects in calculating cancellation rates reported in the periods prior to the quarter ended june 30 2018 and accordingly we do not believe changes to those previously reported cancellation rates are required 

for the year ended december 31 2018 298 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter historically the retention rate has generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities in addition we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets we intend to use these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

senior notes and credit agreement

we have issued an aggregate of 26 billion in senior notes and entered into a 250 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks see note 5 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement

the indentures governing our senior notes the “indentures” among us each of the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets in addition the indentures restrict our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create assume incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such nonguarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the senior notes on a pari passu basis

the revolving credit agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that among other things limit our ability and the ability of our existing or future subsidiaries to





























the revolving credit agreement and the indentures also contain customary events of default including those relating to nonpayment breach of representations warranties or covenants crossdefault and crossacceleration bankruptcy and insolvency events invalidity or impairment of loan documentation or collateral change of control and customary erisa defaults none of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business

the revolving credit agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the revolving credit agreement 1 the maximum consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 425100 and 2 the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 400100 as of december 31 2018 our consolidated leverage ratio was 313100 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 659100 there have been no amounts drawn under the revolving credit agreement since it was entered into on november 20 2014

cash flows

the following table presents the company’s cash and cash equivalents as of the dates indicated

 



 

the following table presents the breakdown of the company’s cash flows for the periods indicated

 



 

cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents were 9042 million and 8895 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively we seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately 2000 million to 2500 million for general operating purposes as of december 31 2018 and 2017 2756 million and 5030 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries as a result of tax reform we can now more efficiently access a significant portion of our cash held outside of the us in the shortterm without being subject to us income taxes repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purpose or other needs including acquisitions or expansion of our products

we believe that global cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and 

financing activities such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect that foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

cash flows from operating activities

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 6128 million and 4042 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by higher cash collections partially offset by higher payments of cash expenses and higher income tax and interest payments 

cash provided by operating activities was 4042 million and 4424 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the yearoveryear decrease reflects higher cash expenses including higher interest and income tax payments partially offset by increased cash collections

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs market data costs interest expenses and income taxes historically the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year

cash flows from investing activities

cash provided by investing activities was 349 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to cash used in investing activities of 480 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the yearoveryear change was primarily driven by the proceeds received from the fea and investorforce divestitures 

cash used in investing activities was 480 million and 420 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively primarily reflecting higher capitalized software development costs mainly related to investments in the msci analytics platform and fixed income products 

cash flows from financing activities

cash used in financing activities was 6265 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2675 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the yearoveryear change primarily reflects higher repurchases of shares and higher dividend payments partially offset by the proceeds from our debt offering in may 2018 

cash used in financing activities was 2675 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 3729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the yearoveryear change primarily reflects lower repurchases of treasury shares partially offset by lower proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments

 

 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31 2018

 



 





the obligations related to our uncertain tax positions which are not considered material have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2018 and 2017 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitat ive and qualitative disclosures about market risk

foreign currency risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollarreported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 129 and 134 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 129 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2018 422 was in euros 294 was in japanese yen and 178 was in british pounds sterling of the 134 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2017 396 was in euros 273 was in japanese yen and 268 was in british pounds sterling 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 235 and 217 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked 

investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 404 and 369 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees hungarian forints euros hong kong dollars swiss francs and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 04 million 22 million and 02 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

our business model

 

our principal business model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our offerings for a fee which is in a majority of cases paid in advance fees may vary by offering number of users or volume of services

 

we also charge clients to use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee typically in arrears for the use of our intellectual property primarily based on the assets under management “aum” in their investment product 

 

certain exchanges use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee typically paid in arrears for the use of our intellectual property primarily based on their volume of trades

 

clients also subscribe to periodic benchmark reports digests and other publications associated with our real estate offerings fees are primarily paid in arrears after the offering is delivered

 

we also realize onetime fees related to customized reports historical data sets and certain implementation and consulting services as well as from certain offerings that are purchased on a nonrenewal basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—segment results” for a breakdown of revenues attributable to recurring subscriptions assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenue for our index analytics and all other reporting segments

competition

 

many industry participants compete with us by offering one or more indexes in similar categories such indexes vary widely in scope including by geographic region business sector and risk category and may be used by clients in a variety of ways in many different markets around the world a number of these markets have become increasingly competitive in recent years

 

among our index competitors are sp dow jones indices llc a joint venture company owned by cme group inc and cme group services llc and by sp global inc and ftse russell a subsidiary of the london stock exchange group plc 

 

there is also growing competition from asset managers and investment banks that create their own indexes often in cooperation with index providers which may among other things provide some form of calculation agent service this is especially true for factor indexes often referred to as “smart beta indexes” asset managers such as wisdomtree and goldman sachs asset management manage funds including etfs based on their own proprietary indexes and many investment banks have launched structured products or created overthecounter derivatives based on their own proprietary indexes

 

many industry participants compete with us by providing one or more similar offerings in a very competitive marketplace for risk management and performance data and analytics

 

our analytics offerings compete with offerings from a range of competitors including axioma inc blackrock solutions bloomberg finance lp and factset research systems inc additionally many of the larger brokerdealers have developed proprietary analytics tools for their clients similarly many investment institutions particularly the larger global organizations have developed their own internal risk management analytics tools

 

we also have a variety of competitors for our other offerings that comprise a smaller portion of our revenues

 

intellectual property and other proprietary rights

 

we consider many aspects of our offerings processes and services to be proprietary we have registered among others “msci” “barra” “riskmetrics” and “riskmanager” as trademarks or service marks in the united states and in certain foreign countries we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks service marks and copyrights as appropriate from time to time we also file patent applications to protect our proprietary rights we currently hold 22 us and foreign patents and have one us patent pending additionally many of our offerings processes and services require the use of intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our offerings and services 

 

although we believe the ownership of patents copyrights trademarks service marks the implementation of certain measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use intellectual property of third parties are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights or any one license to use thirdparty intellectual property for a description of the risks associated with legal protection of our intellectual property and other rights infringement claims and the ability to obtain or renew licenses for thirdparty intellectual property see part i item 1a “risk factors— legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights” below

risks related to our business

we are dependent on third parties to supply data and software for our products and are dependent on certain vendors to distribute our data a refusal by a key vendor to distribute our data or any loss of key outside suppliers of data or software products or reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data or products or any failure by us to comply with our vendors’ licensing requirements could impair our ability to provide our clients with the data products or services they desire which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we rely on the accuracy and quality of thirdparty data and software products and depend on the ability and willingness of thirdparty data and software providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in order to produce and deliver our products provide services and develop new products and services additionally we rely on certain thirdparty vendors to distribute our data to clients while some of our vendors generate revenue in connection with distributing our data others do not derive a direct financial benefit from doing so should any of our key vendors refuse to distribute our data for any reason we would need to find alternative ways to distribute our data which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if the data and software products from our suppliers have errors are delayed have design defects become incompatible with future versions of our products are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all we may not be able to deliver our products and services and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as of december 31 2017 we relied on the data of over 200 suppliers including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world

many of our data and software suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of provision of data by one or more of our significant data suppliers or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the information available for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we also monitor our use of thirdparty data and software products to comply with applicable licensing requirements despite our efforts our use of certain thirdparty data and software products has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased data acquisition or software costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by data or 

software that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty data or software products increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other data or software are substantial and we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent data or software products if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an indexlinked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the us our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products including etfs and mutual funds managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant product’s total expense ratio “ter” additionally competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide indexlinked investment products including etfs the fees providers of indexlinked investment products charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these managers with some providers seeking to win or retain business by charging their clients lower fees as noted above in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in an investment product’s ter in those cases a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or switch to a lower fee index for example at least one large client ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds additionally clients that license our indexes to serve as the basis for listed futures and options contracts might discontinue such contracts we have a differentiated licensing strategy for our indexes and from timetotime experience faster growth in lower fee product areas resulting in a lower average assetbased fee percentage for licensing our indexes while we look to maximize the pricevolume tradeoff over the longterm there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in aum in indexlinked investment products with lower than average product fees not sufficiently offset by growth in aum in indexlinked investment products in higher than average product fees in the instances described above our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients multiple kinds of indexlinked investment products based on the same indexes a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the use of the same index as the basis of an other type of product

if we are required to offer clients materially lower assetbased fee percentages with respect to indexlinked investment products that generate fees based on the assets of such products or our largest clients cease to use our indexes our revenues could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our revenues attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets a decrease in our revenues attributable to these fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

clients that use our indexes as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the value of the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for 217 and 183 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 555 and 474 of the total revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively volatile capital markets which may impact whether investors choose to invest in developed or emerging markets or in the us or nonus markets as well as changing 

investment styles among other factors may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example a trend that favors active investment management over passive investment management could lead to a decreased demand for indexlinked investment products and thus decreased revenue attributable to assets in indexlinked investment products accordingly the value of assets in indexlinked investment products can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if we are unable to offset the impact of decreased values of assets linked to indexlinked investment products including by managing our operating costs our profitability could be materially adversely affected see “— our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” below 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations including interruptions affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and the internet which could impair our ability to provide clients with products and customer service any resulting failures disruptions or instability may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and its components including our data centers and the internet to seamlessly provide clients with products and customer service heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering intrusions or hacking human error cyberterrorism ransomware terrorist attacks affecting sites where we are located natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures technical breakdowns internet failures or computer viruses could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns occur with respect to our operations including to our information technology platform our electronic delivery systems or the internet our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services or to whom we distribute index and constituent data on a real time basis that is used to manage funds that replicate msci indexes may be materially adversely affected for example we have in recent years experienced denialofservice attacks while we have implemented disaster recovery and business continuity plans increased our protection measures in response to global cyberattacks and been able to defend our systems against such disruptions and attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans will be effective in mitigating the risks and costs associated with the particular event that has occurred we have also experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products after we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and may experience such interruptions and delays in the future with respect to migrations within existing data centers or to new data centers in response to such issues we have in the past and could again be required to provide service credits we could also experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from and defend against such disruptions and attacks accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems or the internet may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses failures or breaches

although we currently estimate that the total cost of ongoing development and implementation of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate unexpected or higher than estimated costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect client data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including sensitive and confidential client data such as material nonpublic information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized data access or disclosure if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation may result in claims against us by our clients or regulatory inquiry or censure which could individually or in the aggregate damage our brand and reputation andor have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures results in a security or data privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “ — changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial or operational regulations or the repeal of existing financial or operational regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” below

we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of any material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

we change the composition of our indexes from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our equity indexes can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indexes our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have confidentiality policies in place and have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes relating to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail or we are delayed in implementing such procedures as necessary with respect to a newly acquired business and an employee inadvertently discloses or deliberately misuses material nonpublic information related to one of our indexes our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our confidentiality policies or information barrier policies and procedures could negatively impact our brand or reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list indexlinked investment products based on our equity indexes only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have information barrier procedures in place designed to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information related to our equity indexes if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our equity indexes which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

increased competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger 

competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product larger competitors may offer price incentives to expand their market share and may also consolidate with one another or form joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies resulting from an expanded suite of products and services 

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many of the markets for our products and services including for singlepurpose product companies low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example more brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes recent developments including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information advances in public cloud computing and the increase in open source code as well as proprietary software in specific areas such as pricing high volume computing orchestration layers for services and visualization have increasingly allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further 

financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic conditions may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer providers or by selfsourcing certain of their informational needs accordingly competitive and market pressures may result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses including as a result of client closures and consolidations price reductions prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an indexlinked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above and part i item 1 “business—competition” above

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage transitions and product integrations failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of this industry and the impact of technological change on our products and services we must continually introduce new products and services enhance including through integration of products and services within msci and with thirdparty platforms existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services if among other things we fail to accurately anticipate or respond or adapt to evolving technologies and changing industry standards if we fail to anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients or cannot be integrated with thirdparty platforms if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated if we misprice our new products and services if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely or if competitors in any business line introduce products services systems and processes that are more competitive than ours or that gain greater market acceptance we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results for example we have made and need to continue to make investments in our technology platform in order to provide competitive products and services to our clients from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also present execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially 

adversely affected see “— if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” below 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 278 and 257 of our total revenues respectively our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing subscription base and our investment product licenses failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 115 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 953 and 937 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs that are based on our indexes if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an indexlinked investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past if we experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs application development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other costs and we cannot adjust to these costs our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected

additionally there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development marketing efforts or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “— to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage transitions and product integrations failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge skills experience and abilities of our employees accordingly we believe that the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key management research and development sales and marketing operations information technology and other personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if our cash and longterm equity incentive compensation programs do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our customers and achieve business objectives may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

any future expansion may place significant strain on our management and other resources

our expansion in the past and any future expansion particularly in emerging market locations has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial human resources management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with prior expansion of our business there can also be no assurance that if in the future we expand organically or by way of acquisition our management will be effective in attracting engaging and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all of our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing expansion additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses ” below “— we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected ” above part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below and part i item 1 “business—company history” above

changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial or operational regulations or the repeal of existing financial or operational regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly these regulations are complex evolve frequently and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could materially adversely affect our business it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses on june 23 2016 the united kingdom voted to leave the european union through the referendum of the united kingdom’s membership of the european union an event commonly referred to as “brexit” brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations that affect our business if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties additionally we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws rules or regulations in various jurisdictions which could individually or in the aggregate result in materially higher compliance costs to us it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license and price our products or could impose additional costs on us some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could restrict our clients’ ability to use our products and services unless we change our products and services or could otherwise impact our clients’ demand for our products and services as such to the extent that our clients become bound by certain laws rules or regulations we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services at their request even in instances where we are not directly legally bound to the extent that we rely on our clients and vendors to provide data for our products and services and certain laws rules or regulations impact our clients’ and vendors’ ability to provide that data to us or regulate the fees for which such data can be provided our ability to continue to produce our products and services or the related costs could be negatively impacted there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the regulations that most materially impact us are described below





under the markets in financial instruments regulation regulation eu no 6002014 where the value of a financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark will be required to ensure that clearing entities and trading venues may license the benchmark and receive relevant price and data feeds and information regarding the composition methodology and pricing of the benchmark for the purposes of clearing and trading access to such licenses and information will have to be offered by the benchmark owner within three months of the request and on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms that are no less favorable than the terms offered to other trading venues unless a different basis can be objectively justified in the event that compliance with this regulation expected to be required in 2019 leads to a change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes increases our cost of doing business or diminishes our intellectual property rights it could have a material adverse effect on our index product line

on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en which are updated from time to time by esma “guidelines” the guidelines limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the guidelines became effective as of february 17 2013 with respect to newly launched ucits funds they became effective for all ucits funds on february 17 2014 we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines to the extent that esma issues new guidance or different or new interpretations with respect to the guidelines complying with such guidance could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations including a material negative impact on our licensing of index data andor our indexes as the basis of etfs and other ucits additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations

on july 17 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published its final report on principles for financial benchmarks “iosco principles” the iosco principles cover conflicts of interest benchmark quality and integrity methodology requirements procedures related to handling complaints documentation requirements and audit reviews the iosco principles require benchmark administrators to publicly disclose whether they comply with the iosco principles within 12 months of their initial publication with such compliance subject to audit we announced our implementation of the iosco principles on july 16 2014 and posted our compliance statement and audit results on our website in each of july 2016 and july 2015 for 2017 we continued to rely on our 2016 compliance statement as updated in light of the regulation eu 20161011 to the extent that iosco issues new principles or different or new interpretations with respect to the existing iosco principles andor any individual jurisdictions adopt similar new or different concepts proposals or regulations complying with such principles concepts proposals or regulations could lead to a change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes including without limitation by increasing our costs of doing business diminishing our intellectual property rights imposing constraints on our ability to meet our commitments to our data providers or causing our data providers to refuse to provide data to us any of which could have material adverse effect on our equity and real estate index product lines 

additionally on january 3 2018 rules became effective in the eu that require sellside firms to unbundle the costs of research and separately charge buyside firms for execution investment research and other advisory services msci is not such a firm and we rely on our clients to determine whether their use of our products and services falls within the definition of investment research and from which budget our fees are to be paid the impact of these decisions on our clients’ budgets and the ongoing uncertainty around the application of the rules has led to and could continue to lead to delays in the execution of agreements and the potential loss of revenue in the eu specifically for certain of our esg research products if additional rules or interpretations are issued that expand the definition of investment research services in such a way that causes our clients in the eu to believe other of our products and services constitute investment research these negative impacts could increase which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 







in some instances in connection with the provision of data and services we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject to the extent that our clients are subject to increased 

regulation we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us for example a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage for example on september 20 2016 blackrock received exemptive relief from the sec to create certain indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage similarly some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products or services unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products or services may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations a growing number of asset managers and investment banks in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services or acting together with an industry group or association have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs structured products or otc derivatives see “— a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above and “— increased competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” above

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and services despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and services may not be subject to intellectual property protection









likewise we cannot be certain that we are aware or in the future will be aware of every instance in which this sort of behavior may occur additionally the enforceability of our license and other agreements’ nondisclosure obligations and the availability of remedies to us in the event of a breach may vary due to the many different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located





third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights such claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages or limit our future use of certain technologies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

from time to time we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have increasingly pursued or may consider pursuing patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model software application or other relevant product or process we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time and result in costly litigation or delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that 

we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop providing or using the affected products or services or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could introduce security vulnerabilities into our internal network system impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims the quality of the code or the security of the code despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system through security patches and software updates we are still vulnerable to cyberattacks launched by those seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in such code such cyberattacks could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary applications with open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage additionally the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form portions of our proprietary code to reengineer our products or systems to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely or costeffective basis or to take other remedial action that could divert resources away from our development efforts any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our products and services support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets products we develop or license including our indexes may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing use of our products or services as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts based on what may be alleged to be even a small error or malfunction in certain of our products or services

errors or defects can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product or publish a methodology we might have to delay the product or index release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to correct such errors if undetected errors exist in our products or methodologies or if our products fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our brand or reputation lost sales delays in commercial release third party claims contractual disputes negative publicity 

delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors additionally any undetected errors defects malfunctions or similar problems in our products or methodologies could lead to significant failures disruptions or slowdowns with respect to our product delivery to clients the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations see “— certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations including interruptions affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and the internet which could impair our ability to provide clients with products and customer service any resulting failures disruptions or instability may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations ” above 

while we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or services or delay or failure to provide services these provisions do not always eliminate liability resulting from the occurrence of any of these events entirely and may have certain exceptions that could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws any such claims brought against us even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult if not impossible to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities as well as the measurement of the performance of our clients’ equity investments against equity benchmarks if investment in equity markets declines if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities or if they discontinue the use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios volatility in equity markets over an extended period or other factors may lead to an overall decline in the viability of such markets which could reduce new business opportunities for us and our clients to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for our equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations additionally while we offer products and services to both active and passive investment managers an economic trend that significantly favors either active investment management or passive investment management could lead to a decrease in our revenues that would not be fully offset by revenues generated from products and services sold to passive or active investment managers see “— our revenues attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets a decrease in our revenues attributable to these fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above

additionally our equity indexes serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our equity indexes could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity indexes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize synergies from acquisitions or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions our financial results may be materially adversely affected

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions as we continue pursuing selective acquisitions to support our growth strategy we seek to be a disciplined acquirer and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices in addition our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into our business we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses or that 

our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate in addition our past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt our operations any acquisition could present a number of risks including 



















in the event that we experience a high level of acquisitionrelated activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 134 and 169 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 134 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2017 396 was in euros 273 was in japanese yen and 268 was in british pounds sterling of the 169 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2016 355 was in british pounds sterling 344 was in euros and 249 was in japanese yen

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 217 and 183 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which approximately twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 369 and 383 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees 

swiss francs euros hungarian forints hong kong dollars chinese yuan and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss resulted from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 22 million and 02 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations while the full effects of brexit will not be known for some time the brexit vote caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling the weaker british pound sterling means that revenues earned in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar revenues the weaker british pound sterling also means that expenses incurred in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar expenses the weaker british pound sterling could also impair the purchasing power of our clients and could result in decreased demand for our products and services the fall in the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar and the strengthening of the us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling could have significant impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2017 we had 21 billion of outstanding indebtedness in the form of senior unsecured notes collectively the “senior notes” we also maintain a 2200 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement the “revolving credit agreement” which was undrawn as of december 31 2017 the revolving credit agreement is subject to an unused commitment fee of 035 we recognized an interest expense associated with the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement of approximately 1160 million for the year ended december 31 2017

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness we cannot assure you that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or access it we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity and we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all absent sufficient cash flow and the ability to refinance we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements however limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected

we may need to incur substantial additional debt from time to time under our existing debt agreements to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify including by making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness

furthermore the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit among other things our and our existing and future subsidiaries’ financial flexibility if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default that in some cases if continuing could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under our revolving credit agreement see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for a description of the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 

a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition

our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt our outstanding debt under the senior notes which amounts to an aggregate principal amount of approximately 21 billion currently has a noninvestment grade rating any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by such agency if in the agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant such future circumstances include but are not limited to adverse changes to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage for example on july 28 2015 the board of directors authorized corporate action that led to a change in the company’s target leverage and interest expense allowing for the issuance of our 2025 senior notes on august 13 2015 following the board of directors’ authorization one of the ratings agencies described the increase as substantially higher than current leverage levels and as a result downgraded our credit rating this recent downgrade and any further downgrade could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain

in addition our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating the senior notes contain covenants that require the company to offer to repurchase the 2024 senior notes the 2025 senior notes or the 2026 senior notes as applicable in cash at a price equal to 1010 of their par value in the event of a change of control of the company or disposition of substantially all of the company’s assets the company is obligated to make such repurchase offer to noteholders if the following two conditions are met at the time of or as a result of such change of control or asset sale transaction i the senior notes are rated below investment grade by each rating agency that rates the senior notes and ii the senior notes are downgraded by any rating agency

any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms accordingly actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the us and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations for example as of december 31 2017 590 of our employees were located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

in order to penetrate markets outside of the us we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world

many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and esg and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the us there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries

we may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or benefits or offers of payments or benefits to foreign governments and their officials and in some cases to employees of a business for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than fully effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities in various jurisdictions

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome or indirect taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth withholding property and goods and services taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” was enacted on december 22 2017 and significantly affected us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and may impact our results of operations in the period issued

tax reform requires complex computations not previously provided in us tax law further compliance with tax reform and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced we have provided a provisional estimate on the transitional effect of tax reform in our financial statements as additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities as accounting treatment is clarified as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect we may make adjustments to provisional transitional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made throughout the allowable measurement period in addition we are in the process of analyzing the effects of new and complex provisions of tax reform that will have an impact on our results starting in fiscal 2018 and this analysis may change as further guidance is issued by relevant taxing authorities furthermore foreign governments may enact laws in response to tax reform that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operation

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 18825 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2017 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable these impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired

in connection with our initial public offering and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant

our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the fullyear financial guidance or longterm targets that we provide publicly 

we provide fullyear financial guidance and longterm targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance for example we provide assumptions regarding our ability to manage our expenses generate free cash flow achieve a certain effective tax rate and achieve our profitability targets while we believe that our annual financial guidance and longterm targets provide investors and analysts with insight to our view of the company’s future performance such financial guidance and longterm targets are based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results if we fail to meet the fullyear financial guidance or achieve the longterm targets that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise 

such guidance during the year or longterm targets over time the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those described below such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those identified below and those described in part 1 item 1a “risk factors” within this annual report on form 10k

overview

we are an innovative and leading provider of missioncritical investment decision support tools including indexes portfolio construction and risk management products and services esg research and ratings and real estate research reporting and benchmarking offerings our researchderived intellectual property includes methodologies models derived data and algorithms collectively “content” as well as applications and services which help our clients manage their investment processes and address their investment risk and regulatory challenges

our clients comprise a wide spectrum of the global investment industry and include asset owners pension funds endowments foundations central banks sovereign wealth funds family offices and insurance companies asset managers institutional mutual funds hedge funds etfs private wealth private banks and real estate investment trusts  private wealth managers private banks real estate investment trusts financial intermediaries banks brokerdealers exchanges custodians trust companies and investment consultants and data distributors

our offerings are used by our clients across multiple asset classes to achieve a wide range of objectives including benchmarking indexlinked product creation portfolio construction performance measurement and attribution risk management as well as investor and regulatory reporting in addition our clients are increasingly integrating the content developed across our company such as factor and esg data and indexes into their investment processes

as of december 31 2017 we had over 7000 clients across 88 countries to calculate the number of clients we use the shipping address of the ultimate customer utilizing the product which counts affiliates user locations or business units within a single organization as separate clients if we aggregate all related clients under their respective parent entity the number of clients would be approximately 4000 as of december 31 2017 we had offices in 32 cities in 21 countries to help serve our diverse client base with 526 of our revenues coming from clients in the americas 349 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 125 in asia and australia

our principal business model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our offerings for a fee which is in a majority of cases paid in advance fees may vary by offering number of users or volume of services fees attributable to annual recurring subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered furthermore a portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee typically in arrears for the use of our intellectual property primarily based on the aum in their investment product we also generate revenues from certain exchanges that use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee typically in arrears for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades in addition we generate revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmark reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our real estate offerings that are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates fees are primarily paid in arrears after the offering is delivered we also realize onetime fees related to customized reports historical data sets and certain implementation and consulting services as well as from certain offerings that are purchased on a nonrenewal basis

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue and profit growth including results accounted for under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” as well as nongaap measures for the company as a whole and by operating segment in addition we focus on operating metrics including run 

rate subscription sales and aggregate retention rate to manage the business our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our profits into excess cash in the future our growth strategy includes a creating broad and innovative researchdriven content b expanding our client base and deepening existing client relationships c developing flexible and scalable technology d expanding valueadded service offerings and e executing strategic relationships and acquisitions 

 

key financial metrics and drivers

as discussed in the previous section we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company including gaap and nongaap measures as detailed below we review revenues by type and by segment or major product line we also review expenses by activity which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed in addition we utilize operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and aggregate retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business

in the discussion that follows we provide variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when the impact is not considered negligible foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period it should be noted that while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in underlying securities that are dominated in currencies other than the us dollar the underlying impact of such will not be reflected in the variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

revenues

our revenues are characterized by type which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned our revenue types are recurring subscription assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment see part 1 item 1 “business—our operating segments” above for additional details on the products and services that we offer

recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements and are recognized in most cases ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date when implementation services are included we recognize revenues ratably from the date the application is put into production through the end of the license period revenues associated with implementation services which are allocated based on msci’s best estimated sales price for such implementation services are recognized ratably over the useful life of those services revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmark reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our real estate offerings are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates

assetbased fees are principally recognized based on the estimated aum linked to our indexes from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client assetbased fees include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes which are primarily based on trading volumes

nonrecurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts and primarily include revenues for providing historical data certain implementation services and other special client requests based on the nature of the services provided nonrecurring revenues are recognized upon delivery or over the service period

effective january 1 2018 msci adopted the new revenue standard as set forth under asc subtopic 60610 “revenue from contracts with customers” see “— recent accounting standards updates ” below for additional information

nongaap financial measures

adjusted ebitda

“adjusted ebitda” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as net income before 1 income loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes 2 provision for income taxes 3 other expense income net 4 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 5 amortization of intangible assets and at times 6 certain other transactions or adjustments

“adjusted ebitda expenses” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and at times certain other transactions or adjustments

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures of the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant onetime unusual or nonrecurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company’s core operating performance in the period all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on among other things longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments accordingly the company’s computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies

run rate

run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our operating revenues over time at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” see “— operating metrics — run rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

subscription sales

subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — subscription sales ” below for additional information

aggregate retention rate

another key operating metric is aggregate retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time see “— operating metrics — aggregate retention rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

senior notes and credit agreement

on november 20 2014 we completed our first private offering of 8000 million aggregate principal amount of 525 senior unsecured notes due 2024 the “2024 senior notes” and also entered into a new 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement the “2014 revolving credit agreement” we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 senior notes together with cash on hand to repay in full our outstanding term loan indebtedness of 7948 million which bore interest at libor plus a margin of 225

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” tax reform significantly revises the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering us corporate income tax rates implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on deemed repatriation of historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “toll charge” 

as part of tax reform the company recorded a provisional net charge to the provision for income taxes of 345 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the net charge of 345 million primarily included an estimated tax charge of approximately 475 million related to the toll charge and an estimated tax charge of approximately 160 million related to a change in assertion that those profits were permanently reinvested overseas as of december 31 2017 partially offset by an estimated tax benefit of approximately 290 million related to the revaluation of deferred taxes at the now lower statutory corporate rate 

while we believe our provisional estimates are reasonable the changes included in tax reform are broad and complex the final impacts of tax reform may differ from the above estimates possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of tax reform guidance from regulatory agencies any legislative action to address questions that arise because of tax reform any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to tax reform or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the impact of tax reform including the impact from changes to current year earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries the sec staff has issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act” that allows for the provisional measurement of amounts related to the impact from tax reform for a period of up to one year after the enactment date of tax reform to finalize the recording we currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of our fiscal year ending december 31 2018 see note 2 “recent accounting standards updates” and note 10 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for more information

cost of revenues

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 86 to 2739 million compared to 2521 million for the year ended december 31 2016 reflecting increases across all three reporting segments the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefit costs primarily relating to wages and salaries severance and incentive compensation as well as higher noncompensation information technology costs market data costs occupancy costs personnel related costs and travel and entertainment costs

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 64 to 1773 million compared to 1667 million for the year ended december 31 2016 reflecting increases in the index and all other segments the change was driven by an overall increase in compensation and benefit costs relating to incentive compensation severance wages and salaries and benefits as well as higher noncompensation marketing costs and travel and entertainment costs

amortization of intangibles

amortization of intangible asset expense for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased 53 to 445 million compared to 470 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease during the year was due to 55 million of lower amortization from intangibles associated with past acquisitions primarily related to certain intangible assets associated with the riskmetrics group llc acquisition becoming fully amortized partially offset by 30 million of increased amortization of capitalized software development costs relating to new internally developed software implementations

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 33 to 354 million compared to 343 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily the result of increased depreciation associated with continued investment in our data centers as well as increased software amortization relating to new system implementations

other expense income net

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 99 to 1123 million compared to 1022 million for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily driven by 144 million of higher interest expense resulting from the increased level of indebtedness associated with the 2026 senior notes offering partially offset by higher interest income associated with higher cash balances as well as the impact of a 37 million charge in 2016 related to estimated losses associated with miscellaneous transactions

income taxes

the provision for income tax expense increased 303 to 1629 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 1251 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as a result of a net charge of 345 million related to tax reform discussed above and higher income before provision for income taxes these amounts reflect effective tax rates of 349 and 324 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

included in the effective tax rate of 349 for the year ended december 31 2017 is 74 percentage points related to tax reform with the remaining 275 percentage points related to the operating tax rate and other miscellaneous favorable discrete items the ongoing efforts to better align our tax profile with our global operating footprint helped improve our operating tax rate the discrete items included 57 million of stockbased compensation excess tax benefits related to the adoption of new accounting guidance that first impacted results during the year ended december 31 2017 see note 2 “recent accounting standards updates” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for more information

tax reform significantly revises the future ongoing us corporate income tax rate for us corporations reducing it from a maximum of 350 to a flat 210 effective beginning on january 1 2018 as a result we expect our effective tax rate for the year ending december 31 2018 to be lower compared to the year ended december 31 2017 

 

net income

operating metrics

run rate

“run rate” estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements “client contracts” for the next 12 months assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects for etfs the market value on the last trading day of the period for futures and options the most recent quarterly volumes and for other nonetf products the most recent clientreported assets run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales whether to existing or new clients when we execute client contracts even though the license start date and associated revenue recognition may not be effective until a later date we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services even though such notice is not effective until a later date

changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in run rate the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate for numerous reasons including





















the following table presents run rates by reportable segment as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated 

 



 

december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016 

total run rate grew 174 to 13657 million as of december 31 2017 compared to 11633 million as of december 31 2016 recurring subscription run rate grew 108 to 10489 million as of december 31 2017 compared to 9463 million as of december 31 2016 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscription run rate increased 95 as of december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016

run rate from assetbased fees increased 460 to 3168 million as of december 31 2017 from 2170 million as of december 31 2016 primarily driven by higher aum in etfs as well as increases in nonetf passive funds and futures and options contracts all linked to msci indexes as of december 31 2017 the value of aum in etfs linked to msci indexes was 7443 billion up 2629 billion or 546 from 4814 billion as of december 31 2016 the increase of 2629 billion consisted of net inflows of 1393 billion and market appreciation of 1236 billion

index recurring subscription run rate grew 109 to 4510 million as of december 31 2017 compared to 4067 million as of december 31 2016 driven by strong growth in core products growth in new products including factor and esg indexes as well as growth in custom index products 

run rate from analytics products increased 84 to 4895 million as of december 31 2017 compared to 4515 million as of december 31 2016 primarily driven by growth in both multiasset class and equity analytics products adjusted for the impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations analytics run rate increased 68 as of december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016

run rate from all other products increased 231 to 1084 million at december 31 2017 compared to 881 million at december 31 2016 driven by a 155 million or 315 increase in esg run rate to 646 million and a 49 million or 125 increase in real estate run rate to 438 million the increase in esg run rate was primarily driven by growth in esg ratings products the increase in real estate run rate was primarily driven by growth in market information and portfolio analysis service products adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations esg run rate increased 273 real estate run rate increased 38 and all other run rate increased 169 in each case as of december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016

december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 

total run rate grew 68 to 11633 million as of december 31 2016 compared to 10893 million as of december 31 2015 recurring subscription run rate grew 65 to 9463 million as of december 31 2016 

compared to 8882 million as of december 31 2015 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations recurring subscription run rate would have increased 72 as of december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 

run rate from assetbased fees increased 79 to 2170 million as of december 31 2016 from 2010 million as of december 31 2015 primarily driven by higher aum in nonetf passive funds and etfs as well as increases in futures and options contracts all linked to msci indexes as of december 31 2016 the value of aum in etfs linked to msci indexes was 4814 billion up 480 billion or 111 from 4334 billion as of december 31 2015 the increase of 480 billion consisted of net inflows of 372 billion and market depreciation of 108 billion

index recurring subscription run rate grew 103 to 4067 million as of december 31 2016 compared to 3689 million as of december 31 2015 driven by growth in core products factor and thematic products and usage fees there was a negligible impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on index recurring subscription run rate as of december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015

run rate from analytics products increased 34 to 4515 million as of december 31 2016 compared to 4367 million as of december 31 2015 primarily driven by growth in sales of equity models as well as riskmanager barraone and investorforce products adjusting for the impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations analytics run rate would have increased 38 as of december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015

subscription sales 

the following table presents our recurring subscription sales cancellations and nonrecurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated

 



 

aggregate retention rate

another key metric is our “aggregate retention rate” this metric is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our segment products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our aggregate retention rate is computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in indexlinked investment products or futures and options contracts in each case linked to our indexes aggregate retention rate for a nonannual period reflects the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period

the following table presents our aggregate retention rate by reportable segment and product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

 



 

the aggregate retention rate for a period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew during the period and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized aggregate retention rate for the period 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded cancellations of 198 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 198 million to derive 793 million of annualized cancellations this 793 million was then divided by the 9463 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 84 the 84 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 916 for the fourth quarter

for the year ended december 31 2017 339 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter historically the aggregate retention rate has generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities in addition we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets we intend to use these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

cash flows

the following table presents the company’s cash and cash equivalents as of the dates indicated

 



 

the following table presents the breakdown of the company’s cash flows for the periods indicated

  



 

cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents were 8895 million and 7918 million as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively msci seeks to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately 2000 million to 2500 million for general operating purposes as of december 31 2017 and 2016 5030 million and 2082 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries as a result of tax reform msci can now more efficiently access a significant portion of its cash held outside of the us in the shortterm without being subject to us income taxes repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions the increase in cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries primarily reflects ongoing efforts to better align our tax profile with our global operating footprint the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purpose or other needs including acquisitions or expansion of our products

we believe that global cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

accounts receivable

accounts receivable as of december 31 2017 increased 1061 million or 479 to 3276 million compared to 2215 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the yearoveryear change primarily reflects changes to our international billing practices associated with realigning our tax profile with our global operating footprint a lengthening of client payment process approval cycles and higher accruals of assetbased fees related to the growth in aum as we fully implement the changes to our international billing practices we expect a decrease in our accounts receivable balances excluding the impact of adopting asc subtopic 60610 which would improve the rate of growth of our future cash flows

cash flows from operating activities

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 4042 million and 4424 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the yearoveryear decrease reflects higher cash expenses including higher interest and income tax payments partially offset by increased cash collections

cash provided by operating activities was 4424 million and 3212 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects higher billings and collections from customers a decrease in cash expenses and lower cash payments for income taxes including the impact of income tax refunds partially offset by higher interest payments

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs market data costs interest expenses and income taxes historically the payment of cash for 

compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

cash flows from investing activities

cash used in investing activities was 480 million and 420 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively primarily reflecting higher capitalized software development costs mainly related to investments in the msci analytics platform and fixed income products

cash used in investing activities was 420 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 489 million for the year ended december 31 2015 

cash flows from financing activities

cash used in financing activities was 2675 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 3729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the yearoveryear change primarily reflects lower repurchases of treasury shares partially offset by lower proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments

cash used in financing activities was 3729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 47 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects the impact of lower proceeds from borrowings and increased repurchases of treasury shares

 

contractual obligations

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31 2017

 



 





the obligations related to our uncertain tax positions which are not considered material have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2017 and 2016 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

recent accounting standards updates

effective january 1 2018 we will be adopting the new revenue standard as set forth under asc subtopic 60610 using the modified retrospective transition method compared to the revenue recognition method used prior 

to the adoption the new revenue standard will generally result in more revenue being recognized upfront or earlier in the life of new contracts for certain of our products and services including fees related to the licensing of desktop applications implementation and setup services and multiyear deals the lost future period revenue from existing contracts as a result of the cumulative adjustment to retained earnings is expected to be largely offset by the acceleration of revenue from certain new contracts as a result the overall impact of adopting the new revenue standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or the annual trend of revenue however it may increase quarterly revenue variability by segment depending on the timing of deal closings and renewals the adoption of asc subtopic 60610 will also result in a change in the accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances compared to the current guidance under the current guidance we record the value of an invoice to accounts receivable and deferred revenue once the service period begins under the new guidance however when we issue an invoice for a noncancellable nonrefundable contract msci has an unconditional right to consideration and recognizes a valid receivable and the corresponding deferred revenue this change in accounting will result in similar increases in both the accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 134 and 169 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 134 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2017 396 was in euros 273 was in japanese yen and 268 was in british pounds sterling of the 169 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2016 355 was in british pounds sterling 344 was in euros and 249 was in japanese yen 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 217 and 183 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 369 and 383 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees swiss francs euros hungarian forints hong kong dollars chinese yuan and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 22 million 02 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

competition

many industry participants compete with us by offering one or more similar indexes such indexes vary widely in scope including by geographic region business sector and risk category and may be used by clients in a variety of ways in many different markets around the world a number of these markets have become increasingly competitive in recent years

among our index competitors are ftse russell a subsidiary of the london stock exchange group plc and sp dow jones indices llc a joint venture company owned by cme group inc and cme group services llc and by sp global inc

there is also growing competition from asset managers and investment banks that create their own indexes often in cooperation with index providers which may among other things provide some form of calculation agent service this is especially true for factor indexes often referred to as “smart beta indexes” asset managers such as wisdomtree and goldman sachs asset management manage funds or etf indexes based on their own proprietary indexes and many investment banks have launched structured products or entered into otc derivatives based on their own proprietary indexes

many industry participants compete with us by providing one or more similar offerings in a very competitive marketplace for risk management data and analytics

our analytics products and services compete with offerings from a range of competitors including axioma inc blackrock solutions bloomberg finance lp and factset research systems inc additionally many of the larger brokerdealers have developed proprietary analytics tools for their clients similarly many investment institutions particularly the larger global organizations have developed their own internal risk management analytics tools

we also have a variety of competitors for our other products that comprise a smaller portion of our revenues

intellectual property and other proprietary rights 

we consider many aspects of our products processes and services to be proprietary we have registered among others “msci” “barra” “riskmetrics” “riskmanager” “fea” “investorforce” and “ipd” as trademarks or service marks in the united states and in certain foreign countries we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks service marks and copyrights as appropriate from time to time we also file patent applications to protect our proprietary rights we currently hold 23 us and foreign patents and have one us patent pending additionally many of our products processes and services require the use of intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services

although we believe the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks service marks the implementation of certain measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use intellectual property of third parties are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights or any one license to use thirdparty intellectual property for a description of the risks associated with legal protection of our intellectual property and other rights infringement claims and the ability to obtain or renew licenses for thirdparty intellectual property see part i item 1a “risk factors— legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights” below

risks related to our business

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty data and software and any loss of key outside suppliers of data or software products or reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data or products or any failure by us to comply with our vendors’ licensing requirements could impair our ability to provide our clients 

with the products or services they desire which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on the accuracy and quality of thirdparty data and software products and depend on the ability and willingness of thirdparty data and software providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in order to produce and deliver our products provide services and develop new products and services

if the data and software products from our suppliers have errors are delayed have design defects become incompatible with future versions of our products are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all we may not be able to deliver our products and services and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as of december 31 2016 we relied on the data of over 200 suppliers including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world

many of our data and software suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of provision of data by one or more of our significant data suppliers or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the information available for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we also monitor our use of thirdparty data and software products to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts our use of certain thirdparty data and software products has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased data acquisition or software costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by data or software that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty data or software products increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other data or software are substantial and we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent data or software products if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of their funds linked to msci indexes or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the us our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant fund’s total expense ratio “ter” additionally competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide exchange traded funds “etfs” among other products the fees etf providers charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for 

these etf managers with some etf providers seeking to win or retain business by charging their clients lower fees as noted above in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in a product provider’s ter in those cases a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues 

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or switch to a lower fee index and at least one large client has ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds in the past we offer a diversified pricing structure for our indexes and from timetotime experience faster growth in lower fee product areas resulting in a lower average assetbased fee percentage for licensing our indexes while we look to maximize the pricevolume tradeoff over the longterm there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in lower fee products areas that is not sufficiently offset by growth in the volume of aum in etfs or other products that are based on our indexes in the instances described above our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the ability of our licensees to cease using our indexes or switch to lower fee indexes is generally true not just with respect to an index’s use as the basis of an etf but also with respect to its use as the basis of other financial products including mutual funds and institutional funds finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients etfs and institutional funds based on the same indexes a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the use of the same index as the basis of the other type of product

if we are required to offer clients materially lower assetbased fee percentages with respect to investment products that generate fees based on the assets of such products or our largest clients cease to use our indexes our revenues could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our revenues attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets a decrease in our revenues attributable to these fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

clients that use our indexes as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the value of the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for 183 and 184 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 474 and 483 of the total revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles among other factors may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product accordingly the value of assets linked to etfs can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if we are unable to offset the impact of decreased values of assets linked to etfs including by managing our operating costs our profitability could be materially adversely affected see “— our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” below

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations including interruptions affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and the internet that could impair our ability to provide clients with products and customer service any resulting failures disruptions or instability may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and its components including our data centers and the internet to seamlessly provide clients with products and customer service heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering intrusions or hacking human error cyberterrorism terrorist attacks affecting sites where we are located natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures technical breakdowns internet failures or computer viruses could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns occur with respect to our operations including to our information technology platform our electronic delivery systems or the internet our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services or to whom we distribute index and constituent data on a real time basis that is used to manage funds that replicate msci indexes may be materially adversely affected for example we have in recent years experienced denialofservice attacks while we have implemented disaster recovery and business continuity plans and have been able to defend our systems against such disruptions and attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans will be effective in mitigating the risks and costs associated with the particular event that has occurred we have also experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products after we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and may experience such interruptions and delays in the future with respect to migrations within existing data centers or to new data centers in response to such issues we have in the past and could again be required to provide service credits we could also experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from and defend against such disruptions and attacks accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems or the internet may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses failures or breaches

although we currently estimate that the total cost of ongoing development and implementation of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate unexpected or higher than estimated costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect client data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including sensitive and confidential client data such as material nonpublic information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized data access or disclosure if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation may result in claims against us by our clients or regulatory inquiry or censure which could individually or in the aggregate damage our brand and reputation andor have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures results in a security or data privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “ —changes in government 

regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial regulations or the repeal of existing financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” below  

we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

we change the composition of our indexes from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our equity indexes can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indexes our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have confidentiality policies in place and have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail or we are delayed in implementing such procedures as necessary with respect to a newly acquired business and an employee inadvertently discloses or deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indexes our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our confidentiality policies or information barrier policies and procedures could negatively impact our brand or reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list etfs or other financial products based on our equity indexes only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have information barrier procedures in place designed to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our equity indexes if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our equity indexes which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

increased competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we face competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product larger competitors may offer price incentives to expand their market share and may also consolidate with one another or form joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies resulting from an expanded suite of products and services

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many of the markets for our products and services including for singlepurpose product companies low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example more brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes recent developments including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information advances in public cloud computing and the increase in open source code as well as proprietary software in specific areas such as pricing high volume computing orchestration layers for services and visualization have increasingly allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further 

financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic conditions may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer providers or by selfsourcing certain of their informational needs accordingly competitive pressures may result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of their funds linked to msci indexes or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above and part i item 1 “business—competition” above  

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage transitions and product integrations failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of this industry and the impact of technological change on our products and services we must continually introduce new products and services enhance including through integration of products and services within msci and with thirdparty platforms existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services if among other things we fail to accurately predict or respond or adapt to evolving technologies and changing industry standards if we fail to anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients or cannot be integrated with thirdparty platforms if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely or if competitors in any business line introduce products services systems and processes that are more competitive than ours or that gain greater market acceptance we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results for example we have made and need to continue to make investments in our technology platform in order to provide competitive products and services to our clients from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also present execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see “— if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” below

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 257 and 260 of our total revenues respectively our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing subscription base and our investment product licenses failure of one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 94 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 937 and 930 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs that are based on our indexes if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of their funds linked to msci indexes or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons including if our operating costs are higher than expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past if we experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs software development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other costs and we cannot adjust to these costs our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected

additionally there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development marketing efforts or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “— to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage transitions and product integrations  failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly we believe that the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

during 2015 and 2016 our board of directors adopted significant changes to the company’s compensation approach and philosophy including the implementation of a more performancebased approach to the payment of annual cash compensation pursuant to our annual incentive plan the “aip” based on the achievement of certain financial metrics and longterm equity incentive compensation based on total shareholder return for executive officers and managing directors we also implemented the cip initiative in 2016 to further incentivize our client coverage personnel by aligning each eligible employee’s target annual incentive with key performance metrics in accordance with our overall goals and strategy if our cash and equity incentive plans including our new cash bonus plan ie the aip and cip and longterm equity incentive compensation program do not adequately engage our 

key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our customers and achieve business objectives may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  

any future expansion may place significant strain on our management and other resources

our expansion in the past and any future expansion particularly in emerging market locations has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with prior expansion of our business there can also be no assurance that if in the future we expand organically or by way of acquisition our management will be effective in attracting engaging and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all of our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing expansion additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses” below “— we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected ” above part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below and part i item 1 “business—company history” above

changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial regulations or the repeal of existing financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly these regulations are complex evolve frequently and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could materially adversely affect our business it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties additionally we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws rules or regulations in various jurisdictions which could individually or in the aggregate result in materially higher compliance costs to us it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license our products or could impose additional costs on us some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services likewise to the extent that our clients become bound by certain laws rules or regulations we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services at their request even in instances where we are not directly legally bound there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted to the extent that our current and potential future clients are affected by adverse changes in the financial markets ” below





in some instances in connection with the provision of data and services we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject to the extent that our clients are subject to increased regulation we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products



 



under the markets in financial instruments regulation regulation eu no 6002014 where the value of a financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark will be required to ensure that clearing entities and trading venues may license the benchmark and receive relevant price and data feeds and information regarding the composition methodology and pricing of the benchmark for the purposes of clearing and trading access to such licenses and information will have to be offered by the benchmark owner within three months of the request and on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms that are no less favorable than the terms offered to other trading venues unless a different basis can be objectively justified in the event that compliance with this regulation expected to be required in 2019 leads to a change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes increases our cost of doing business or diminishes our intellectual property rights it could have a material adverse effect on our index product line

on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en which are updated from time to time by esma “guidelines” the guidelines limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the guidelines became effective as of february 17 2013 with respect to newly launched ucits funds they became effective for all ucits funds on february 17 2014 we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines to the extent that esma issues new guidance or different or new interpretations with respect to the guidelines complying with such guidance could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations including a material negative impact on our licensing of index data andor our indexes as the basis of etfs and ucits additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations  

on july 17 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published its final report on principles for financial benchmarks “iosco principles” the iosco principles cover conflicts of interest benchmark quality and integrity methodology requirements procedures related to handling complaints documentation requirements and audit reviews the iosco principles require benchmark administrators to publicly disclose whether they comply with the iosco principles within 12 months of their initial publication with such compliance subject to audit we announced our implementation of the iosco principles on july 16 2014 and posted our audit results on our website in july 2015 and july 2016 to the extent that iosco issues new principles or different or new interpretations with respect to the existing iosco principles andor any individual jurisdictions adopt similar new or different concepts proposals or regulations complying with such principles concepts proposals or regulations could lead to a change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes including without limitation by increasing our costs of doing business diminishing our intellectual property rights imposing constraints on our ability to meet our commitments to our data contributors or causing our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at a reasonable cost or at all any of which could have material adverse effect on our equity and real estate index product lines

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

our clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products or services unnecessary for them similarly a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage for example on september 20 2016 blackrock received exemptive relief from the sec to create certain indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products or services may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations a growing number of asset managers and investment banks in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services or acting together with an industry group or association have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs structured products or otc derivatives see “— a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above and “— increased competition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations” above

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to 

protect our products and services despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and services may not be subject to intellectual property protection  









likewise we cannot be certain that we are aware or in the future will be aware of every instance in which this sort of behavior may occur additionally the enforceability of our license and other agreements’ nondisclosure obligations and the availability of remedies to us in the event of a breach may vary due to the many different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located







third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights such claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages or limit our future use of certain technologies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

from time to time we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have increasingly pursued or may consider pursuing patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model software application or other relevant product or process we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time and result in costly litigation or delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop providing or using the affected products or services or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code further some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage additionally the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form portions of our proprietary code to reengineer our products or systems to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely or costeffective basis or to take other remedial action that could divert resources away from our development efforts any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems we may among other things become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  

our products and services support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets products we develop or license including our indexes may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing use of our products or services as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts based on what may be alleged to be even a small error or malfunction in certain of our products or services

errors or defects can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product or publish a methodology we might have to delay the product or index release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to correct such errors if undetected errors exist in our products or methodologies or if our products fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our brand or reputation lost sales delays in commercial release third party claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors additionally any undetected errors defects malfunctions or similar problems in our products or methodologies could lead to significant failures disruptions or slowdowns with respect to our product delivery to clients the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations see “— certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations including interruptions affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and the internet that could impair our ability to provide clients with products and customer service any resulting failures disruptions or instability may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations ” above

while we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or services or delay or failure to provide services these provisions do not always eliminate liability resulting from the occurrence of any of these events entirely and may have certain exceptions that could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws any such claims brought against us even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult if not impossible to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities as well as the measurement of the performance of our clients’ equity investments against equity benchmarks if investment in equity markets declines if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities or if they discontinue the use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios volatility in equity markets over an extended period or other factors may lead to an overall decline in the viability of such markets which could reduce new business opportunities for us and our clients to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for our equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— our revenues attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets a decrease in our revenues attributable to these fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above

additionally our equity indexes serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our equity indexes could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity indexes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  our principal business model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at specified locations and often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services for most of our products and services our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe the primarily annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted to the extent that our current and potential future clients are affected by adverse changes in the financial markets

unfavorable changes in global or domestic financial market conditions may negatively impact the performance and financial viability of our current and potential clients the majority of which are in the financial services industry as a result adverse financial market conditions could result in reduced demand for our products and services due to among other things the closure or consolidation of our clients a decrease in the number of fund launches including hedge fund launches or a shift in our clients’ investment patterns the inability of our customers to pay for products or services including forgoing products or services delaying payment or underpaying prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize synergies from acquisitions or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions our financial results may be materially adversely affected

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions as we continue pursuing selective acquisitions to support our growth strategy we seek to be a disciplined acquirer and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices in addition our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into our business we cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses or that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate in addition our past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt our operations any acquisition could present a number of risks including



















in the event that we experience a high level of acquisitionrelated activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 169 and 178 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 169 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2016 355 was in british pounds sterling 344 was in euros and 249 was in japanese yen of the 178 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2015 370 was in british pounds sterling 358 was in euros and 216 was in japanese yen

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 183 and 184 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 383 and 413 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees swiss francs euros hungarian forints hong kong dollars chinese yuan and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss resulted from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 02 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations most recently on june 23 2016 the 

united kingdom voted to leave the european union through the referendum of the united kingdom’s membership of the european union an event commonly referred to as “brexit” while the full effects of brexit will not be known for some time the brexit vote caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  for example the exchange rate as of december 31 2016 was £ 0811 compared with a rate on june 23 2016 of £ 0681 and a rate on june 1 2016 of £ 0691 the weaker british pound sterling means that revenues earned in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar revenues the weaker british pound sterling also means that expenses incurred in british pound sterling translate to lower reported us dollar expenses the weaker british pound sterling could also impair the purchasing power of our clients and could result in decreased demand for our products and services the fall in the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar and the strengthening of the us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling could have significant impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations  

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2016 we had 21 billion of outstanding indebtedness from our senior notes and a related interest expense of 1017 million for the year ended december 31 2016 we also maintain a 2200 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement the “revolving credit agreement” which was undrawn as of december 31 2016

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows the terms of our current financing include restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing and future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt in addition the agreements relating to our senior notes restrict our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create assume incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such nonguarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing our outstanding senior notes on a pari passu basis affirmative covenants in the agreements relating to our current financings may interfere with our ability to obtain financings and to engage in business activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our revolving credit agreement also requires us to comply with financial ratio maintenance covenants under the terms of our revolving credit agreement certain increases or decreases in our consolidated leverage ratio may result in an increase or decrease in the fees applicable to i outstanding borrowings under such facility and ii undrawn commitments under such facility in each case in a predetermined percentage amount the “applicable margin” if we experience as of a scheduled quarterly test date an increase in our consolidated leverage ratio above a threshold amount specified in our revolving credit agreement the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings andor the fee rate on our unused commitments will rise by the applicable margin consequently any increase in our consolidated leverage ratio could result in higher debt service costs under such facility even if we do not have borrowings outstanding under such facility

as of december 31 2016 our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement was 350100 we are therefore currently subject to the highest applicable margin provided for under our revolving credit agreement the rate on our unused commitments is 035

if we incur substantial additional indebtedness the risks described above could be further exacerbated  

we may need to incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict but do not completely prohibit us from doing so we are permitted to borrow up to 2200 million under our revolving credit agreement in addition the indentures governing our senior notes allow us to issue additional senior notes under certain circumstances accordingly we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time under our existing debt agreements and otherwise to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify specifically a high level of indebtedness could among other things

















if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default under the terms of such agreements which could result in an acceleration of repayment

if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes there could be a default under the terms of these debt agreements our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants including meeting financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants or meet such financial ratios and tests and any such default under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financings mergers and acquisitions or other corporate opportunities

additionally if certain events of default occur continue or remain uncured under our debt agreements we are required to repurchase redeem repay or prepay as the case may be the debt under such agreement prior to maturity andor such debt could become accelerated and immediately due and payable for example upon the occurrence of specified changes of control in our ownership the holders of the senior notes have the right to compel us to repurchase all or part of the 2024 senior notes the 2025 senior notes or the 2026 senior notes as applicable in cash at a price equal to 1010 of the aggregate principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued interest additionally the holders of the 2024 senior notes the 2025 senior notes or the 2026 senior notes may in connection with certain events of default accelerate the principal amount of the 2024 senior notes the 2025 senior notes or the 2026 senior notes as applicable together with accrued and unpaid interest and declare the same to be due and payable after giving the required notice

likewise under our revolving credit agreement the lenders may in connection with certain events of default elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees to be due and payable 

our debt agreements also contain crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions pursuant to which a default is deemed to have occurred under such agreement if a default or acceleration occurs under another debt agreement for example our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain crossdefault provisions relating to nonpayment by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with debt aggregating 500 million or more subject to certain cure periods if any of the above events should occur we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness additionally we may not be able to amend our debt agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash however our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control if we are unable to access or generate a sufficient amount of cash our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity however we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected

absent sufficient cash flow in the us and the ability to refinance we could also be forced to sell assets or to repatriate cash to the us to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations however the terms of our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale accordingly we may not be able to sell assets or access cash outside the us quickly enough to generate sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations on our indebtedness additionally the repatriation of cash to the us could result in additional taxes

increased costs of financing a reduction in the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and access to capital fluctuations in the levels of interest rates and inflation could materially adversely affect our liquidity operating expenses or results of operations

at december 31 2016 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and all of our outstanding longterm debt was subject to a fixed interest rate adverse conditions in the domestic and global financial markets could however increase our costs for additional financing and negatively affect our ability to refinance repurchase redeem repay or prepay as the case may be our debt at or prior to maturity raise capital or fund other types of obligations additionally we may face increased financing costs if we are no longer able to deduct interest paid on our borrowings if there are changes to domestic and international tax laws see “ —we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities in various jurisdictions ” below our access to capital is also impacted by changes in interest rates and inflation which could restrict the availability to us of shortterm and longterm funding recent interest rates in the us have been at historically low levels and increases in these rates could increase our interest expense and reduce our funds available for operations and other purposes with respect to newly incurred debt or borrowings if any additionally any downgrades to our credit rating or outlook may increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing see “— a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition ” below

if we borrow under our revolving credit agreement such indebtedness would bear interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars libor tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply 

of and demand for credit in the london interbank market increases in the interest rate generally and particularly when coupled with any significant variable rate indebtedness could materially adversely impact our interest expenses to the extent we borrow under our revolving credit agreement we are not required to enter into interest rate swaps to hedge such indebtedness if we decide not to enter into hedges on such indebtedness our interest expense on such indebtedness will fluctuate based on libor or other variable interest rates consequently we may have difficulties servicing such unhedged indebtedness and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be materially adversely affected  

if we do enter into interest rate swap agreements developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivative instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivative instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our interest rate hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations

a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition

our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt our outstanding debt under the senior notes which amounts to an aggregate principal amount of approximately 21 billion currently has a noninvestment grade rating any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by such agency if in the agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant such future circumstances include but are not limited to adverse changes to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage for example on july 28 2015 the board of directors authorized corporate action that led to a change in the company’s target leverage and interest expense allowing for the issuance of our 2025 senior notes on august 13 2015 following the board of directors’ authorization one of the ratings agencies described the increase as substantially higher than current leverage levels and as a result downgraded our credit rating this recent downgrade and any further downgrade could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain

in addition our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating the senior notes contain covenants that require the company to offer to repurchase the 2024 senior notes the 2025 senior notes or the 2026 senior notes as applicable in cash at a price equal to 1010 of their par value in the event of a change of control of the company or disposition of substantially all of the company’s assets the company is obligated to make such repurchase offer to noteholders if the following two conditions are met at the time of or as a result of such change of control or asset sale transaction i the senior notes are rated below investment grade by each rating agency that rates the senior notes and ii the senior notes are downgraded by any rating agency

any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms accordingly actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments broad 

regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the us and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations for example as of december 31 2016 562 of our employees were located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally

in order to penetrate markets outside of the us we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world

many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and esg and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the us there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries

we may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities in various jurisdictions

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome or indirect taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate

although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities  

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 19035 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2016 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable these impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired

in connection with our initial public offering and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant

risks related to ownership of our common stock

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate in the future for a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control one possible outcome of such fluctuation could be a decline in the value of your investment for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include





































in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management

our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the fullyear financial guidance or longterm targets that we provide publicly

we provide fullyear financial guidance and longterm targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance for example we provide assumptions regarding our ability to manage our expenses generate free cash flow achieve a certain effective tax rate access cash generated outside of the us and achieve our profitability targets while we believe that our annual financial guidance and longterm targets provide investors and analysts with insight to our view of the company’s future performance such financial guidance and longterm targets are based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results if we fail to meet the fullyear financial guidance or achieve the longterm targets that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year or longterm targets over time the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our common stock price

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock granted in connection with our initial public offering and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plans the following table presents the number of shares of common stock issued under each of our equity incentive compensation plans as of december 31 2016

 







for additional information on our equity compensation plans see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity—equity compensation plans” and note 8 “shareholders’ equity” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein as of february 17 2017 90545374 shares of our common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act

in the future we may also issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock

provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock

provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include











generally the amendment of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of our outstanding voting stock not owned by such person 

these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of the company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your common stock in an acquisition

we may not be able to maintain payments of dividends at current levels and the failure to do so may negatively affect the market price of our common stock

on september 17 2014 our board of directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders on october 30 2014 we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter on february 1 2017 our board of directors declared our next quarterly cash dividend in an amount of 028 per share of common stock to be paid on march 15 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on february 17 2017 although we plan to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends at the target rates currently 3040 of adjusted eps established by our board of directors from time to time there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so or that we will achieve an annual dividend rate in any particular amount our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the quarterly or annual rate of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders

our cash dividend policy is based upon our board of directors’ assessment of our financial condition and the general business environment in which we operate at the time of declaration any future declaration and payment of cash dividends to our shareholders depends on the assessment of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control and a change in any one or more factors could affect our dividend policy these factors include our results of operations and liquidity future prospects for earnings and cash flows our available cash on hand and anticipated cash needs the level and timing of capital expenditures principal repayments and other capital needs our ability to comply with current or future financial and negative covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments including the incurrence covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes tax treatment of dividends in the us legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other provisions of law in any applicable jurisdiction and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in light of the prevailing conditions at the time of such assessment as a result we can give no assurance that we will in the future choose or be able to declare or pay a cash dividend maintain our current level of dividends or increase them over time our failure to declare or pay a dividend a reduction in the level of such dividend or the discontinuance of such dividend could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock

the share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors may not result in enhanced value to shareholders and may negatively affect our share price

on october 26 2016 the board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 7500 million worth of shares of our common stock together with the 3303 million authorization remaining under the 2015 repurchase program the “2016 repurchase program” as of december 31 2016 the remaining authorization under the 2016 program was approximately 8700 million share repurchases made pursuant to the 2016 repurchase program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time based on market and other conditions this authorization may be modified suspended or terminated by the board of directors at any time without prior notice the 2016 repurchase program carries risks and uncertainties including among other things that the authorized purchases will not be completed within the expected timing or will not be made at the best possible price additionally we are permitted to and may discontinue the 2016 repurchase program at any time including without limitation upon determining that we have insufficient cash flows or surplus levels required by delaware law to continue to execute such program any such discontinuation or inability to continue to execute the 2016 repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline accordingly there can be no assurance that we will pursue or be successful in completing the execution of the 2016 repurchase program or any future repurchase program additionally the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our shares as a result any 

repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us in the ordinary course of business while the amounts claimed could be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainty that exists therefore it is possible that our business operating results financial condition or cash flows in a particular period could be materially adversely affected by certain contingencies however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of matters that are currently pending or asserted will not individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows

as of december 31 2016 we had over 6500 clients across 87 countries to calculate the number of clients we may count certain affiliates user locations or business units within a single organization as separate clients if we aggregate all related clients under their respective parent entity the number of clients would be approximately 3900 as of december 31 2016 we had offices in 33 cities in 21 countries to help serve our diverse client base with 523 of our revenues coming from clients in the americas 352 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 125 in asia and australia

our principal business model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for a fee which is in a majority of cases paid up front additionally our recurring subscription offerings include our managed services offering whereby we oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients fees attributable to annual recurring subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered furthermore a portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee primarily in arrears for the use of our intellectual property primarily in arrears based on the investment product’s assets we also generate revenues from certain exchanges that use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee primarily in arrears for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades in addition we generate revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmark reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our real estate products that are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates fees are primarily paid in arrears after the product is delivered we also realize onetime fees related to customized reports historical data sets and certain implementation and consulting services as well as from certain products and services that are purchased on a nonrenewal basis

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue and profit growth including gaap and nongaap measures for the company as a whole as well as by operating segment in addition we focus on operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and aggregate retention rate to manage the business our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our profits into 

excess cash in the future our growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing product offerings including combining existing product features or data derived from our products to create new products and c seeking to acquire products technologies services and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and product offerings 

 

key financial metrics and drivers

we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company including gaap and nongaap measures as detailed below we review revenues by type and by segment or major product line we also review expenses by activity which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed in addition we utilize operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and aggregate retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business

in the discussion that follows we provide variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period

revenues

our revenues are characterized by type which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned our revenue types are recurring subscription assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment see part 1 item 1 “business—our operating segments” above for additional details on the products and services that we offer

recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements and are recognized in most cases ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date when implementation services are included we recognize revenues ratably from the date the application is put into production through the end of the license period revenues associated with implementation services which are allocated based on msci’s best estimated sales price for such implementation services are recognized ratably over the useful life of those services revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmark reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our real estate benchmark business are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates

assetbased fees are principally recognized based on the estimated assets under management “aum” linked to our indexes from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client assetbased fees include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes which are primarily based on trading volumes

nonrecurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts and primarily include revenues for providing historical data certain implementation services and other special client requests based on the nature of the services provided nonrecurring revenues are recognized upon delivery or over the service period

operating expenses

we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories













costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or when not directly attributable an estimate is allocated based on the type of effort involved

cost of revenues

cost of revenues consists of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs including data center platform and infrastructure costs costs to acquire produce and maintain market data information costs of research to support maintain and rebalance existing products costs of product management teams costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources finance and legal costs

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses consists of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales force and marketing teams as well as costs incurred in other groups associated with acquiring new business including product management research technology and sales operations

research and development

rd expenses consists of the costs to develop new or enhance existing products and the costs to develop new or improved technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily includes the costs of application development quality and assurance research product management project management and the technology support associated with these efforts

general and administrative

ga expenses consists of costs primarily related to finance operations human resources office of the ceo legal corporate technology corporate development and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed but are instead allocated to a product or service

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definitelived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and consists of customer relationships trademarks and trade names technology and software proprietary processes and data and noncompetition agreements we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented we have no indefinitelived intangibles

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture  fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets

other expense income net

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments transition services income associated with our sale of iss foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda

“adjusted ebitda” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as net income before income loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes plus provision for income taxes other expense income net depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements amortization of intangible assets and at times certain other transactions or adjustments

“adjusted ebitda expenses” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures of the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant onetime unusual or nonrecurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company’s core operating performance in the period all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on among other things longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments accordingly the company’s computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies

run rate

run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our operating revenues at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” see “— operating metrics — run rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

subscription sales

subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues see “— operating metrics — subscription sales ” below for additional information

aggregate retention rate

another key operating metric is aggregate retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues see “— operating metrics — aggregate retention rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected see note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation— significant accounting policies ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a listing of our accounting policies

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased 58 to 2521 million compared to 2677 million for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by strong expense management particularly in the analytics segment as reflected by lower compensation and benefits costs attributable to a higher percentage of employees in emerging market centers which have lower cost structures and severance costs as well as a decrease in noncompensation information technology and occupancy costs

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 27 to 1667 million compared to 1623 million for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by higher incentive compensation partially offset by lower salary expense and severance costs as well as higher noncompensation marketing costs

research and development

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased 27 to 752 million compared to 773 million for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to an increase in capitalized software development costs the year ended december 31 2015 includes a noncash charge of 34 million related to the termination of a technology project in the analytics segment

general and administrative

ga expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 14 to 872 million compared to 860 million for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits costs partially offset by lower noncompensation professional fees

the following table presents operating expenses using compensation and noncompensation categories rather than using activity categories for the years indicated

 



 

compensation and benefits costs are our most significant expense and typically represent more than 60 of our operating expenses or more than 70 of the combined total of the cost of revenues selling and marketing rd and ga expense categories we had 2862 employees as of december 31 2016 compared to 2754 employees as of december 31 2015 our continued growth in emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits expenses as of december 31 2016 562 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 528 of our employees as of december 31 2015

compensation and benefits costs for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased 28 to 4143 million compared to 4262 million for year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to lower severance as well as higher capitalized software development costs the higher capitalized software development costs includes a noncash charge of 29 million related to the termination of a technology project in the analytics segment recognized during the year ended december 31 2015

noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased 01 to 1669 million compared to 1671 million for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by a decrease in occupancy and professional fees as well as a noncash charge of 05 million related to the termination of a technology project in the analytics segment recognized during the year ended december 31 2015 these decreases were partially offset by increases in costs primarily attributable to marketing

other expense income net

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 880 to 1022 million compared to 543 million for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by 393 million of higher interest expense resulting from the increased level of indebtedness a 37 million charge for estimated losses associated with miscellaneous transactions as well as the impact of the 64 million from gains on the sale of investments realized in the year ended december 31 2015

income taxes

the provision for income tax expense was 1251 million and 1195 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively these amounts reflect effective tax rates of 324 and 342 for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by efforts to better align our tax profile with our global operating footprint for the year ended december 31 2016 317 of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes was generated by foreign operations compared to 191 for the year ended december 31 2015

the effective tax rate of 324 for the year ended december 31 2016 reflects our operating tax rate adjusted for the impact of certain discrete items included in the discrete items was the release of a reserve for uncertain tax positions related to an irs audit settlement overall the discrete items decreased our effective tax rate by 10 in the year ended december 31 2016

the effective tax rate of 342 for the year ended december 31 2015 reflects our operating tax rate adjusted for the impact of certain discrete items included in the discrete items was a claim for an additional deduction related to us production activities for prior years which was partially offset by a provision for state tax liabilities related to prior years overall the discrete items decreased our effective tax rate by 06 in the year ended december 31 2015

income loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes

on april 30 2014 msci completed the sale of iss which is reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015 reflects the impact of a 64 million outofperiod income tax charge associated with tax obligations triggered upon the sale of iss

operating metrics

run rate

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time primarily represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from thencurrent subscriptions and investment product licenses we provide to our clients under renewable contracts or agreements assuming all contracts or agreements that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment 

product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects for etfs the market value on the last trading day of the period for futures and options the most recent quarterly volumes and for nonetf funds the most recent client reported assets under such license or subscription the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future revenues there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of



















changes in run rate between periods may be attributable to among other things increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indexes the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes price changes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions

the following table presents run rates by reportable segment as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated

subscription sales

the following table presents our recurring subscription sales cancellations and nonrecurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated

 



 

aggregate retention rate 

another key metric is our “aggregate retention rate” this metric is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our aggregate retention rate is computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indexes or futures and options contracts linked to our indexes aggregate retention rate for a nonannual period reflects the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period

the following table presents our aggregate retention rate by reportable segment and product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

 



 

the quarterly aggregate retention rate is calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized aggregate retention rate for the quarter

for example in the fourth quarter of 2016 we recorded cancellations of 223 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 223 million to derive 894 million of annualized cancellations this 894 million was then divided by the 8882 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 101 the 101 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 899 for the fourth quarter

for the year ended december 31 2016 344 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter historically the aggregate retention rate has generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities in addition we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets we intend to use these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

we believe that domestic cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds will continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10k and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect existing foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter

cash flows from operating activities

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 4348 million and 3060 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects higher billings and collections from customers a decrease in cash expenses and lower cash payments for income taxes including the impact of income tax refunds partially offset by higher interest payments

cash provided by operating activities was 3060 million and 3057 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects higher cash inflows from operating 

results offset by higher payments related to interest and cash taxes cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014 includes cash flows from discontinued operations

cash used in investing activities was 489 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 2970 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects the impact for the year ended december 31 2014 of 3628 million in cash received upon the disposition of iss partially offset by the purchase of gmi ratings

cash used in financing activities was 3653 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 199 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects the impact of lower proceeds from borrowings and increased repurchases of treasury shares

foreign currency risk

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 169 and 178 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 169 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2016 355 was in british pounds sterling 344 was in euros and 249 was in japanese yen of the 178 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2015 370 was in british pounds sterling 358 was in euros and 216 was in japanese yen 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 183 and 184 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 383 and 413 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees swiss francs hungarian forints hong kong dollars euros mexican pesos and chinese yuan expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss resulted from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 02 million 22 million and 30 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

 clients 

as of december 31 2015 msci served approximately 6400 clients across 86 countries worldwide with 522 of revenues coming from clients in the americas 355 in emea and 123 in asia and australia to calculate the number of clients we may count certain affiliates user locations or business units within a single organization as separate clients for example the asset management and brokerdealer units of a diversified financial services firm may be treated as separate clients even though the financial services firm is the only party to the applicable subscriptions or licenses if we aggregate all related clients under their respective parent entity the number of clients would be approximately 3850 as of december 31 2015 

our aggregate retention rate was 934 and 930 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—key financial metrics and drivers— operating metrics—aggregate retention rate ” for the definition of aggregate retention rate and more detailed aggregate retention rate data

in the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock inc and its affiliates “blackrock” accounted for 103 106 and 97 of our operating revenues respectively for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 930 921 and 891 respectively of our revenues from blackrock were attributable to fees based on the aum of etfs linked to msci equity indexes including its ishares etf business

marketing 

we market our products to asset owners and managers chief investment officers active and passive portfolio managers chief risk officers and financial intermediaries our research and product management teams seek to understand our clients’ investment processes and needs in order to design tools that help clients understand the dimensions of performance and risk in their portfolios and make betterinformed investment decisions 

members of our research team and other employees regularly speak at industry conferences as well as at our own events for example we hosted approximately 800 seminars webinars conferences and workshops in various locations across the globe in 2015 these events bring our staff and our clients together expose those clients to our latest research and product enhancements and give our staff an opportunity to gain insight into our clients’ needs 

our marketing professionals arrange interviews for our industry and product experts in prominent financial and trade media and issue press releases from time to time on client wins new research and product developments we also communicate with both existing clients and prospective clients through our email newsletters which deliver research insights and product specific news through our public website and client portals and via social media 

our marketing department collaborates with our product specialists to analyze our clients’ use of our products and to analyze the competitive landscape for our products we also supplement these direct marketing efforts with targeted online advertising and cobranding initiatives with some of our major clients 

sales and client support 

as of december 31 2015 our client coverage offices included approximately 280 salespeople and 300 clientsupport personnel worldwide of these over 85 were located in new york and 100 were located in london

we have expanded our sales efforts to increase our revenues and our client service efforts to further ensure client satisfaction and develop client loyalty for example over the last few years we opened sales and client coverage offices in santiago chile and seoul korea and expanded our sales presence in china and the middle east in 2015 we also significantly increased the number of client coverage employees in mumbai india and monterrey mexico 

we also have sales and client support teams that are dedicated to specific client segments in order to increase our impact in each such segment including with respect to asset managers hedge funds asset owners financial advisors private wealth managers and broker dealers in the americas we also increased our focus on smaller asset managers and hedge funds financial advisors and insurance firms our sales and client support staff are based around the world to enable us to provide valuable facetoface client service and focus efforts on developing new clients in more locations 

the sophisticated nature of our products and their uses demand a sales and client support staff with strong academic and financial backgrounds most new sales require several facetoface meetings with the prospective client and the sales process for large and complex sales is likely to involve a team comprising sales client support product management and research for example for barra and riskmetrics branded products sales and client support personnel are available to onboard new clients and new users which includes providing intensive onsite training in the use of the models data and software applications underlying each product client support also provides ongoing support which may include onsite visits telephone and email and routine support needed in connection with the use of the product or how it can help clients improve their processes all of which are included in the recurring subscription fee we believe that the size quality knowledge and experience of our sales and client support staff as well as their proximity to clients differentiate us from our competitors

 item 1a   risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected you should read the section titled “forwardlooking statements” on page 1 for a description of the types of statements that are considered forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index analytics real estate and esg products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers similarly most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data throughout our businesses we utilize certain data provided by third party data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world as of december 31 2015 there were over 200 such data suppliers if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our data suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us for example standard  poor’s competes with us in index products supplies index data that we distribute in our portfolio analytics software products and jointly developed and maintains gics and gics direct with us some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of provision of data by one or more of our significant data suppliers or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the information available for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers have sought and others may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative 

 

sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock inc and its affiliates “blackrock” and in our largest market the us our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide exchange traded funds “etfs” among other products the fees etf providers charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these etf managers 

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index and at least one large client has ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds in the past in such instances our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the ability of our licensees to cease using our indexes is generally true not just with respect to an index’s use as the basis of an etf but also with respect to its use as the basis of other financial products including mutual funds and institutional funds finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients etfs and institutional funds based on the same indexes a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the use of the same index as the basis of the other type of product 

if we are required to offer clients materially lower assetbased fee percentages with respect to investment products that generate fees based on the assets of such products or our largest clients cease to use our indexes our revenues could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our revenues attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets a decrease in our revenues attributable to these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

clients that use our indexes as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the value of the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues in addition in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in a product provider’s total expense ratio “ter” in those cases a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for 184 and 178 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 483 and 476 of the revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles among other factors may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product accordingly the value of assets linked to etfs can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time see “— our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted to the extent that our current and potential future clients are affected by adverse changes in the financial markets ” below 

 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems the internet and our information technology platform and any failures disruptions or instability may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and its components including our data centers and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error cyberterrorism natural disasters power loss or computer viruses could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns occur with respect to our electronic delivery systems the internet or our information technology platform our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services or to whom we distribute index and constituent data on a real time basis that is used to manage funds that replicate msci indexes may be materially adversely affected for example we have in recent years experienced denialofservice attacks while we have been able to defend our systems against such attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future we have also experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products after we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and may experience such interruptions and delays in the future with respect to the migrations within existing data centers or to new data centers in response to such issues we have in the past and could again be required to provide service credits we could also experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also incur increased operating expenses to repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from and defend against such disruptions and attacks accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems or the internet may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses failures or breaches 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect client data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including sensitive and confidential client data such as material nonpublic information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized data access or disclosure if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation may result in claims against us by our clients or regulatory inquiry or censure which could individually or in the aggregate damage our reputation andor have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures results in a security or data privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “ —changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations—data privacy legislation ” below 

 

we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indexes from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our equity indexes can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indexes our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have confidentiality policies in place and have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail or we are delayed in implementing such procedures as necessary with respect to a newly acquired business and an employee inadvertently discloses or deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indexes our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our confidentiality policies or information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list etfs or other financial products based on our equity indexes only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our equity indexes if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our equity indexes which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product larger competitors may offer price incentives to expand their market share and may also consolidate with one another or form joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies resulting from an expanded suite of products and services 

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many of the markets for our products including for singlepurpose product companies recent developments including advances in public cloud computing and the increase in open source as well as proprietary software in specific areas such as pricing high volume computing orchestration layers for services and visualization have increasingly allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example more brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes see “— increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” below 

 

financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic conditions may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products including by seeking products at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer providers or by selfsourcing certain of their informational needs accordingly competitive pressures may result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above and part i item 1 “business—our competition” above 

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and product enhancements and effectively manage transitions and product integrations failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of this industry and the impact of technological change on our products we must continually introduce new products and services enhance including through integration of products within msci and with thirdparty platforms existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services if among other things we fail to accurately predict or respond or adapt to evolving technologies and changing industry standards if we fail to anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients or cannot be integrated with thirdparty platforms if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely or if competitors in any business line introduce products services systems and processes that are more competitive than ours or that gain greater market acceptance we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results for example we have made and need to continue to make investments in our technology platform in order to provide competitive products and services to our clients from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and platforms and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also present execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see “— if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” below 

if we are unable to manage our operating costs as anticipated or our operating costs are higher than expected our operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs software development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected 

 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 260 and 258 of our total revenues respectively our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing subscription base failure of one or more of these subscription objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 103 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 930 and 921 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs that are based on our indexes if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development and marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “— to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and product enhancements and effectively manage transitions and product integrations  failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly we believe that the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

during 2015 and 2016 our board of directors adopted significant changes to the company’s compensation approach and philosophy including the implementation of a more formulaic approach to the payment of annual cash incentive compensation based on the achievement of certain financial metrics and longterm equity incentive compensation based on the achievement of sharebased performance targets for certain awards to executive officers and managing directors if our cash and equity incentive plans including our new cash bonus plan and longterm equity incentive compensation program do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our products and services as well as our ability to support and retain our customers and achieve business objectives may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our expansion may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our expansion effectively to increase revenue and profitability our expansion in recent years including in emerging market locations has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the expansion of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to expand organically or by way of acquisitions our management will be effective in attracting engaging and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all of our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing expansion additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive any failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses in many ways” below “— we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract necessary qualified personnel including through our compensation programs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected ” above part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below and part i item 1 “business—company history” above 

changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties additionally we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws rules or regulations in various jurisdictions which could individually or in the aggregate result in materially higher compliance costs to us it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license our products or could impose additional costs on us some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services likewise to the extent that our clients become bound by certain laws rules or regulations we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or processes at their request even in instances where we are not directly legally bound there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted to the extent that our clients are affected by adverse changes in the financial markets ” below 

 

  

  

 we may also be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world in addition we may be materially adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 

in some instances in connection with the provision of data and services we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject to the extent that our clients are subject to increased regulation we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products 

 

  

 on october 20 2011 the european commission issued its proposal for mifidmifir 2 com 2011 0652 and com 2011 0656 agreement in principle has been reached among the european commission parliament and council and we expect that the regulation when it becomes effective and when our compliance is required expected in 2019 will among other things mandate that where the 

 

value of a financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark will be required to ensure that clearing entities and trading venues may license the benchmark and receive relevant price and data feeds and information regarding the composition methodology and pricing of the benchmark for the purposes of clearing and trading it is also expected that access to such licenses and information will have to be offered by the benchmark owner within three months of the request and on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms that are no less favorable than the terms offered to other trading venues unless a different basis can be objectively justified because final guidance on the relevant technical standards has not yet been issued by esma it is difficult to predict its full effect on our index business in the event that compliance with this regulation leads to a material change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business or materially diminishes our intellectual property rights it could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en which are updated from time to time by esma “guidelines” the guidelines limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the guidelines became effective as of february 17 2013 with respect to newly launched ucits funds they became effective for all ucits funds on february 17 2014 we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines to the extent that esma issues new guidance or different or new interpretations with respect to the guidelines complying with such guidance could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations including a material negative impact on our licensing of index data andor our indexes as the basis of etfs and ucits additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations 

on july 17 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published its final report on principles for financial benchmarks “iosco principles” the iosco principles cover conflicts of interest benchmark quality and integrity methodology requirements procedures related to handling complaints documentation requirements and audit reviews the iosco principles require benchmark administrators to publicly disclose whether they comply with the iosco principles within 12 months of their initial publication with such compliance subject to audit on july 16 2014 we announced our implementation of the iosco principles and have posted our annual audit results on our website additionally other jurisdictions could adopt similar principles or concepts which could lead to a material change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes materially increase our cost of doing business materially diminish our intellectual property rights materially impact our contractual commitments to our data contributors or cause our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at a reasonable cost or at all any of which could have material adverse effect on our equity and real estate index product lines 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop internally certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them similarly a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage additionally in august 2011 blackrock announced that it was seeking regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations a growing number of asset managers and investment banks in 

 

partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services or acting together with an industry group or association have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes which they use to manage funds or as the basis of etfs structured products or otc derivatives see “— a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above and “— increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

  

 likewise we cannot be certain that we are aware or in the future will be aware of every instance in which this sort of behavior may occur additionally the enforceability of our license and other agreements’ nondisclosure obligations and the availability of remedies to us in the event of a breach may vary due to the many different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located 

 

  

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights such claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages or limit our future use of certain technologies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have increasingly pursued or may consider pursuing patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model software application or other relevant product or process we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets from time to time such complaints are filed by or we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow 

 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code further some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage additionally the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form portions of our proprietary code to reengineer our products or systems to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely or costeffective basis or to take other remedial action that could divert resources away from our development efforts any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability and willingness of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts our use of certain thirdparty software and data has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased software or data acquisition costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

products we develop or license including our indexes may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product or publish a methodology we might have to delay the product or index release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to correct such errors if undetected errors exist in our products or methodologies or if our products fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release third party claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors additionally any undetected errors defects malfunctions or similar problems in our products or methodologies could lead to significant failures disruptions or slowdowns with respect to our product delivery to clients the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations see “— our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems the internet and our information technology platform and any failures disruptions or instability may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients ” above and “ —we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products to support our clients’ investment processes ” below 

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities as well as the measurement of the performance of our clients’ equity investments against equity benchmarks if investment in equity markets declines if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities or if they discontinue the use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios volatility in equity markets over an extended period or other factors may lead to an overall decline in the viability of such markets which could reduce new business opportunities for us and our clients to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for our equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— our revenues attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets a decrease in our revenues attributable to these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above  

additionally our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our equity indexes could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our principal business model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at specified locations and often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services for most of our 

 

products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe the annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information has increased particularly through advances in public cloud computing and the increase in open source as well as proprietary software and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions can also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected see “ —changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations — potential and proposed regulation affecting benchmarks ” above 

our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted to the extent that our current and potential future clients are affected by adverse changes in the financial markets 

unfavorable changes in global or domestic financial market conditions may negatively impact the performance and financial viability of our current and potential clients the majority of which are in the financial services industry as a result adverse financial market conditions could result in reduced demand for our products and services due to among other things the closure or consolidation of our clients a decrease in the number of fund launches including hedge fund launches or a shift in our clients’ investment patterns the inability of our customers to pay for products or services including forgoing products or services delaying payment or underpaying prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable 

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize synergies from acquisitions or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions our financial results may be materially adversely affected 

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions as we continue pursuing selective acquisitions to support our growth strategy we seek to be a disciplined acquirer and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices in addition our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into our business we cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses or that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate in addition our past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt our operations any acquisition could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisitionrelated activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

for all operations outside the us where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in nonoperating “other expense income net” in our consolidated statement of income 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 178 and 202 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 178 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2015 370 was in british pounds sterling 358 was in euros and 216 was in japanese yen of the 202 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2014 383 was in euros 340 was in british pounds sterling and 217 was in japanese yen 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 184 and 178 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 413 and 431 of our operating expenses including operating expense attributable to income loss from 

 

discontinued operations net of income taxes for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees swiss francs euros hungarian forints hong kong dollars chinese yuan and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss resulted from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 22 million and 30 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products to support our clients’ investment processes 

our products support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts based on what may be alleged to be even a small error in certain of our products our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or failure to provide services under our client contracts however these provisions do not always eliminate liability entirely and may have certain exceptions that could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws 

claims against us even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult if not impossible to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company has issued an aggregate principal amount of 16 billion in senior unsecured notes in two discrete private offerings of 8000 million each on november 20 2014 we completed a private offering of 8000 million aggregate principal amount of 5250 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 senior notes” and entered into a new 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement our “2014 revolving credit agreement” we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 senior notes together with cash on hand to prepay in full the 7948 million of outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated senior secured term loan facility on august 13 2015 the company completed its second private offering of 8000 million aggregate principal amount of 5750 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” and together with the 2024 senior notes the “senior notes” the company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the 

 

2025 senior notes for general corporate purposes including without limitation previously announced repurchases of our common stock see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for additional information regarding our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the senior notes 

as of december 31 2015 we had 16 billion of outstanding indebtedness under the senior notes and 2000 million of undrawn aggregate commitments under our 2014 revolving credit agreement which includes 250 million for the issuance of letters of credit any borrowings under our 2014 revolving credit agreement may be voluntarily prepaid and reborrowed however the undrawn portion of the aggregate commitments is subject to an unused commitment fee which upon specified increases in leverage will rise by the applicable margin as defined below 

the senior notes and our 2014 revolving credit agreement are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by our direct or indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5 of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated assets other than certain excluded subsidiaries the “subsidiary guarantors” any amounts due under our 2014 revolving credit agreement would be our and the subsidiary guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the senior notes and any of our other unsecured unsubordinated debt senior to any of our subordinated debt and effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures dated as of november 20 2014 and august 13 2015 governing our senior notes respectively together the “indentures governing our senior notes” among us each of the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing and future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt in addition the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create assume incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such nonguarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the senior notes on a pari passu basis 

our 2014 revolving credit agreement also requires us to comply with the following two financial ratio maintenance covenants which are tested at least quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis i our maximum consolidated leverage ratio must not exceed 375100 and ii our minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio must be at least 400100 under the terms of our 2014 revolving credit agreement certain increases or decreases in our consolidated leverage ratio may result in an increase or decrease in the fees applicable to i outstanding borrowings under such facility and ii undrawn commitments under such facility in each case in a predetermined percentage amount the “applicable margin” if we experience as of a scheduled quarterly test date an increase in our consolidated leverage ratio above a threshold amount specified in our 2014 revolving credit agreement the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings andor the fee rate on our unused commitments will rise by the applicable margin consequently any increase in our consolidated leverage ratio could result in higher debt service costs under such facility even if we do not have borrowings outstanding under such facility 

on august 13 2015 the company completed the offering of the 2025 senior notes which caused our consolidated leverage ratio to increase to 308100 as of december 31 2015 as a result of our increase in leverage we are currently subject to the highest applicable margin provided for under our 2014 revolving credit agreement which has increased the rate on our unused commitments to 035 

in addition our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain certain affirmative covenants any of these restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financings and to engage in business activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition ” below 

 

if we incur substantial additional indebtedness the risks described above could be further exacerbated 

we may need to incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict but do not completely prohibit us from doing so our 2014 revolving credit agreement provides for an incremental facility that allows us to increase aggregate commitments by an additional 2000 million under certain circumstances in addition the indentures governing our senior notes allows us to issue additional senior notes under certain circumstances accordingly we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time under our existing debt agreements and otherwise to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify specifically a high level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default under the terms of such agreements which could result in an acceleration of repayment 

if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes there could be a default under the terms of these debt agreements our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants including meeting financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants or meet such financial ratios and tests and any such default under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities 

additionally if certain events of default occur continue or remain uncured under our debt agreements we are required to repurchase redeem repay or prepay as the case may be the debt under such agreement prior to maturity andor such debt could become accelerated and immediately due and payable for example upon the occurrence of specified changes of control in our ownership the holders of the senior notes have the right to compel us to repurchase all or part of the 2024 senior notes or 2025 senior notes as applicable in cash at a price equal to 1010 of the aggregate principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued interest additionally the holders of the 2024 senior notes or 2025 senior notes may in connection with certain events of default accelerate the principal amount of the 2024 senior notes or 2025 senior notes as applicable together with accrued and unpaid interest and declare the same to be due and payable after giving the required notice 

 

likewise under our 2014 revolving credit agreement the lenders may in connection with certain events of default elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees to be due and payable 

our debt agreements also contain crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions pursuant to which a default is deemed to have occurred under such agreement if a default or acceleration occurs under another debt agreement for example our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain crossdefault provisions relating to nonpayment by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with debt aggregating 500 million or more subject to certain cure periods if any of the above events should occur we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness additionally we may not be able to amend our debt agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash however our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control if we are unable to generate a sufficient amount of cash our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity however we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 

absent sufficient cash flow and the ability to refinance we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations however the terms of our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale accordingly we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations on our indebtedness 

increased costs of financing a reduction in the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and access to capital fluctuations in the levels of interest rates and inflation could materially adversely affect our liquidity operating expenses or results of operations 

at december 31 2015 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 2014 revolving credit agreement and all of our outstanding longterm debt was subject to a fixed interest rate adverse conditions in the domestic and global financial markets could however increase our costs for additional financing and negatively affect our ability to refinance repurchase redeem repay or prepay as the case may be our debt at or prior to maturity raise capital or fund other types of obligations our access to capital is also impacted by changes in interest rates and inflation which could restrict the availability to us of shortterm and longterm funding recent interest rates in the us have been at historically low levels and increases in these rates could increase our interest expense and reduce our funds available for operations and other purposes with respect to newly incurred debt or borrowings if any under our 2014 revolving credit agreement additionally any downgrades to our credit rating or outlook may increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing see “— a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition ” below 

if we borrow under our 2014 revolving credit agreement such indebtedness would bear interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us 

 

dollars libor tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market increases in the interest rate generally and particularly when coupled with any significant variable rate indebtedness could materially adversely impact our interest expenses to the extent we borrow under our 2014 revolving credit agreement we are not required to enter into interest rate swaps to hedge such indebtedness if we decide not to enter into hedges on such indebtedness our interest expense on such indebtedness will fluctuate based on libor or other variable interest rates consequently we may have difficulties servicing such unhedged indebtedness and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be materially adversely affected 

if we do enter into interest rate swap agreements developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivative instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivative instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our interest rate hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

a change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

our credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt our outstanding debt under the senior notes which amounts to an aggregate principal amount of approximately 16 billion currently has a noninvestment grade rating any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by such agency if in the agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant such future circumstances include but are not limited to adverse changes to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage for example on july 28 2015 the board of directors authorized corporate action that led to a change in the company’s target leverage and interest expense allowing for the issuance of our 2025 senior notes on august 13 2015 following the board of directors’ authorization one of the ratings agencies described the increase as substantially higher than current leverage levels and as a result downgraded our credit rating this recent downgrade and any further downgrade could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain 

in addition our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating the senior notes contain covenants that require the company to offer to repurchase the 2024 senior notes or 2025 senior notes as applicable in cash at a price equal to 1010 of their par value in the event of a change of control of the company or disposition of substantially all of the company’s assets the company is obligated to make such repurchase offer to noteholders if the following two conditions are met at the time of or as a result of such change of control or asset sale transaction i the senior notes are rated below investment grade by each rating agency that rates the senior notes and ii the senior notes are downgraded by any rating agency 

any adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms accordingly actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt 

 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to seamlessly provide clients with products and customer service we must protect our equipment and the information stored in our computerbased networks and databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns internet failures computer viruses unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where we are located and other events we also depend on accessible physical office facilities and hardware for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there can be no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events additionally we may incur significant data recovery costs following any such event and the scope of recovery will depend on among other things the effectiveness of our business continuity plans in mitigating the risks associated with the particular event that has occurred 

such events could also have a material adverse effect on our clients for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of ongoing development and implementation of our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate unexpected or higher than estimated costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the us and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations for example as of december 31 2015 528 of our employees were located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

in order to penetrate markets outside of the us we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world 

 

many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and esg and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the us there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

we may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 

our ability to attract and retain customers is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers prospects and the public generally which could negatively impact among other things our ability to attract and retain customers employees and suppliers as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations see “— any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above “— we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our equity indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected ” above and “— if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation s” above 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities in various jurisdictions 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome or indirect taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate 

although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax 

 

provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 19571 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2015 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired 

in connection with our initial public offering and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate in the future for a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control one possible outcome of such fluctuation could be a decline in the value of your investment for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the fullyear financial guidance or longterm targets that we provide publicly 

we provide fullyear financial guidance and longterm targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance for example we provide assumptions regarding our ability to manage our expenses generate free cash flow achieve a certain effective tax rate access cash generated outside of the us and achieve our profitability targets while we believe that our annual financial guidance and longterm targets provide investors and analysts with insight to our view of the company’s future performance such financial guidance and longterm targets are based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results if we fail to meet the fullyear financial guidance or achieve the longterm targets that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year or longterm targets over time the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock granted in connection with our initial public offering and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plans 

as of february 19 2016 98786211 shares of our common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and 

 

certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of december 31 2015 we had issued 7813090 and 173393 shares of common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively in february 2016 the board of directors upon the recommendation of the compensation committee approved the msci inc 2016 omnibus plan “omnibus plan” a new equity incentive compensation plan that the company will propose for approval at the company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders pursuant to the omnibus plan the company will reserve additional shares of common stock for issuance which will be registered under the securities act if the plan is approved by the company’s shareholders see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity—equity compensation plans” 

in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 4257779 shares of msci common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to officers and certain employees of riskmetrics pursuant to the riskmetrics group inc 2000 stock option plan riskmetrics group inc 2004 stock option plan institutional shareholder services holdings inc equity incentive plan and riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan collectively the “rmg plans” as of december 31 2015 we had issued 3837798 shares of common stock under the rmg plans in june 2010 we also filed a registration statement assuming 3060090 shares available under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan as of december 31 2015 we had issued 2097370 shares of common stock under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan which terminated on june 30 2012 see note 10 “shareholders’ equity” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of our outstanding voting stock not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of the company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your common stock in an acquisition 

we may not be able to maintain payments of dividends at current levels and the failure to do so may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

on september 17 2014 our board of directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders on october 30 2014 we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter on february 2 2016 our board of directors declared our next quarterly cash dividend in an amount of 022 per share of common stock to be paid on march 11 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on february 19 2016 although we plan to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends at the target rates currently 3040 of adjusted eps established by our board of directors from time to time there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so or that we will achieve an annual dividend rate in any particular amount our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the quarterly or annual rate of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 

our cash dividend policy is based upon our board of directors’ assessment of our financial condition and the general business environment in which we operate at the time of declaration any future declaration and payment of cash dividends to our shareholders depends on the assessment of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control and a change in any one or more factors could affect our dividend policy these factors include our results of operations and liquidity future prospects for earnings and cash flows our available cash on hand and anticipated cash needs the level and timing of capital expenditures principal repayments and other capital needs our ability to comply with current or future financial and negative covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments including the incurrence covenants contained in our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes tax treatment of dividends in the us legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other provisions of law in any applicable jurisdiction and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in light of the prevailing conditions at the time of such assessment as a result we can give no assurance that we will in the future choose or be able to declare or pay a cash dividend maintain our current level of dividends or increase them over time our failure to declare or pay a dividend a reduction in the level of such dividend or the discontinuance of such dividend could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors may not result in enhanced value to shareholders and may negatively affect our share price 

on october 28 2015 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 10 billion worth of shares of our common stock the “2015 repurchase program” share repurchases made pursuant to the 2015 repurchase program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time based on market and other conditions this authorization may be modified suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time without prior notice the 2015 repurchase program carries risks and uncertainties including among other things that the authorized purchases will not be completed within the expected timing or will not be made at the best possible price additionally we are permitted to and may discontinue the 2015 repurchase program at any time including without limitation upon 

 

determining that we have insufficient cash flows or surplus levels required by delaware law to continue to execute such program any such discontinuation or inability to continue to execute the 2015 repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline accordingly there can be no assurance that we will pursue or be successful in completing the execution of the 2015 repurchase program or any future repurchase program additionally the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our shares as a result any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources

overview 

msci offers content applications and services to support the needs of institutional investors throughout their investment processes msci clients include asset owners such as pension funds endowments foundations central banks family offices and insurance companies asset management firms such as mutual funds hedge funds providers of exchangetraded funds “etfs” private wealth managers and financial intermediaries such as banks brokerdealers exchanges custodians trust companies and investment consultants 

our products and services include indexes and analytical models ratings and analysis that enable institutional investors to integrate environmental social and governance “esg” factors into their investment strategies and analysis of real estate in both privately and publicly owned portfolios clients use our content and applications to help construct portfolios and allocate assets our analytical tools help them measure and manage risk across all major asset classes msci products and services can also be customized to meet the specific needs of our clients as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 6400 clients across 86 countries to calculate the number of clients we may count certain affiliates user locations or business units within a single organization as separate clients if we aggregate all related clients under their respective parent entity the number of clients would be approximately 3850 as of december 31 2015 we had offices in 35 cities in 22 countries to help serve our diverse client base with 522 of our revenues coming from clients in the americas 355 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 123 in asia and australia 

our principal business model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for an annual fee paid upfront additionally our recurring subscriptions include our managed services offering whereby we oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients fees attributable to annual recurring subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered furthermore a portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we also generate revenues from certain exchanges that use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades in addition we generate revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmark reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our real estate products that are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates we also receive revenues from onetime fees related to certain implementation services historical or customized reports advisory and consulting services and from certain products and services that are designed for onetime usage 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue and profit growth including gaap and nongaap measures for the company as a whole as well as by operating segment in addition we focus on operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and aggregate retention rate to manage the business our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our profits into excess cash in the future our growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing product offerings including combining existing product features or data derived from our products to create new 

 

products and c seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and product offerings 

during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we significantly invested in and expanded our operating functions and infrastructure including additional product management sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world as well as our research and our data operations and technology functions the purpose was to maximize our mediumterm revenue and profit growth while at the same time ensuring that msci would remain a leading provider of investment decision support tools into the future as a result the rate of growth of our investments and expenses had in recent years exceeded that of our revenues which had slowed the growth of or even reduced our earnings for example for the year ended december 31 2014 our revenues grew by 91 but our operating income decreased by 09 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 due in part to increased investment in our business we completed our incremental level of investment in the year ended december 31 2014 and have again achieved operating margin expansion for the year ended december 31 2015 

changes in presentation 

effective during the year ended december 31 2015 we changed our reportable segments to reflect certain changes made to the management of our product lines this presentation better aligns our financial reporting with how our products and services are offered to our clients and offers additional insight into how we manage the company we previously disclosed one reportable segment following the change we began disclosing three reportable segments index analytics and all other the all other segment consists of esg and real estate see note 13 “segment information” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information about msci’s reportable segments 

effective during the year ended december 31 2015 we changed our presentation of operating expenses in order to provide more transparency into our underlying cost base consistent with how we manage the company prior to the change operating expenses were grouped and presented as cost of services and selling general and administrative see note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information 

the previously issued financial information has been recast to conform to the current presentation 

key financial metrics and drivers 

we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company including gaap and nongaap measures as detailed below we review revenues by type and by segment or major product line we also review expenses by activity which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed in addition we utilize operating metrics including run rate subscription sales and aggregate retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported portfolio of recurring business 

in the discussion that follows we provide variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period 

revenues 

our revenues are characterized by type which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned our revenue types are recurring subscription assetbased fees and nonrecurring revenues we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment see part 1 item 1 “business—our product segments” above for additional details on the products and services that we offer 

recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements and are recognized in most cases ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the 

 

contract terms the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated the fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date when implementation services are included we recognize revenues ratably from the date the application is put into production through the end of the license period revenues associated with the implementation services which are allocated based on msci’s best estimated sales price for such implementation services are recognized ratably over the useful life of those services revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmark reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our real estate benchmark business are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates 

assetbased fees are principally recognized based on the estimated assets under management “aum” linked to our indexes from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client assetbased fees include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes which are primarily based on trading volumes 

nonrecurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts and primarily include revenues for providing historical data certain implementation services and other special client requests based on the nature of the services provided nonrecurring revenues are recognized upon delivery invoicing or over the service period 

operating expenses 

we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or when not directly attributable an estimate is allocated based on the type of the effort involved 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consists of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs including data center platform and infrastructure costs costs to acquire produce and maintain market data information costs of research to support maintain and rebalance existing products costs of product management teams costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources finance and legal costs 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses consists of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales force and marketing teams as well as costs incurred in other groups associated with acquiring new business including product management research technology and sales operations 

 

research and development 

rd expenses consists of the costs to develop new or enhance existing products and the costs to develop new or improved technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily includes the costs of application development research product management project management and the technology support associated with these efforts 

general and administrative 

ga expenses consists of costs primarily related to finance operations human resources office of the ceo legal corporate technology corporate development and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed but are instead allocated to a product or service 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definitelived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and consists of customer relationships trademarks and trade names technology and software proprietary processes and data and noncompetition agreements we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented we have no indefinitelived intangibles the intangible assets have remaining useful lives ranging from one to 20 years 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture  fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets 

other expense income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments transition services income associated with our sale of iss foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items 

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda 

“adjusted ebitda” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as net income plus income loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes provision for income taxes other expense income net depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements amortization of intangible assets and certain transactions or adjustments 

“adjusted ebitda expenses” a measure used by management to assess operating performance is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets 

the company believes the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures are important in highlighting trends because these measures exclude costs that are more fixed from period to period in addition these measures provide more comparability between the historical operating results and recent operating results that reflect changes due to acquisitions investments and capital structure all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure the tax jurisdictions 

 

in which companies operate and capital investments accordingly the company’s computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” see “— operating metrics — run rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric 

subscription sales 

subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues see “— operating metrics— subscription sales ” below for additional information 

aggregate retention rate 

another key operating metric is aggregate retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues see “— operating metrics — aggregate retention rate ” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected see note 1 “introduction and basis of presentation— significant accounting policies ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a listing of our accounting policies 

factors affecting the comparability of results

on february 6 2014 we utilized the remaining 1000 million repurchase authorization provided by the 2012 repurchase program by entering into an asr agreement to initiate share repurchases aggregating 1000 million the “february 2014 asr agreement”

the weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating our basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by 58 and 36 for the year ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively reflecting the impact of the share repurchase programs partially offset by the impact of restricted stock units and stock options converting to shares

other expense income net 

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 543 million compared to 288 million for the year ended december 31 2014 with the increase primarily driven by 306 million of higher interest expense resulting from the higher interest rates associated with our senior notes and the increased level of indebtedness partially offset by 64 million from gains on the sale of investments realized in the year ended december 31 2015 

 

income taxes 

the provision for income tax expense was 1195 million and 1094 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively these amounts reflect effective tax rates of 342 and 355 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the effective tax rate of 342 for the year ended december 31 2015 reflects our operating tax rate adjusted for the impact of certain discrete items included in the discrete items was a claim for an additional deduction related to us production activities for prior years which was partially offset by a provision for state tax liabilities related to prior years overall the discrete items decreased our effective tax rate by 06 in the year ended december 31 2015 

the effective tax rate of 355 for the year ended december 31 2014 reflects our operating rate adjusted for the impact of certain discrete items that increased our effective tax rate by 03 percentage points included in our effective tax rate was the benefit of the 2014 federal research and development credit the effect of which reduced our full year effective tax rate by 09 percentage points

operating metrics 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time primarily represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from thencurrent subscriptions and investment product licenses we provide to our clients under renewable contracts or agreements assuming all contracts or agreements that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects for etf fees the market value on the last trading day of the period and for nonetf funds and futures and options the most recent periodic fee earned under such license or subscription the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received 

 

a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future revenues there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in run rate between periods may be attributable to among other things increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indexes the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes price changes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions

real estate products run rate increased 29 to 447 million at december 31 2014 compared to 435 million at december 31 2013 adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations run rate would have increased 119 as of december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013

 

subscription sales 

the following table presents our recurring subscription sales cancellations and nonrecurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated 

 

 aggregate retention rate 

another key metric is our “aggregate retention rate” this metric is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our aggregate retention rate is computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indexes or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes aggregate retention rate for a nonannual period reflects the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

 

the following table presents our aggregate retention rate by reportable segment and product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

 the quarterly aggregate retention rate is calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized aggregate retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded cancellations of 199 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 199 million to derive 796 million of annualized cancellations this 796 million was then divided by the 8322 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 96 the 96 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 904 for the fourth quarter 

for the year ended december 31 2015 365 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter historically the aggregate retention rate has generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year 

liquidity and capital resources 

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities in addition we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets we intend to use these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

  cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents were 7777 million and 5088 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively as of december 31 2015 and 2014 1281 million and 1023 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries which could be subject to us federal income taxation on repatriation to the us and some of which could be subject to local country taxes if repatriated to the us in addition repatriation of some foreign cash is further restricted by local laws 

we believe that domestic cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect existing foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

in addition as a result of our efforts to align our tax profile with our global operating footprint we expect our cash balances to grow outside the us over time these balances will be available to meet our needs outside the us whether it be for general corporate purpose or other needs including acquisitions or expansion of our products 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 3060 million and 3057 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the year ended december 31 2015 reflects higher cash inflows from operating results offset by higher payments related to interest and cash taxes cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014 includes cash flows from discontinued operations 

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 3057 million and 3212 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects higher cash expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 

 

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs market data costs interest expenses and income taxes historically the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 489 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 2970 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the 3459 million yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects the impact for the year ended december 31 2014 of 3628 million in cash received upon the disposition of iss partially offset by the purchase of gmi ratings 

cash provided by investing activities was 2970 million and 41 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the 2929 million yearoveryear increase in cash provided by investing activities primarily reflects net cash inflows resulting from the disposition of iss during the year ended december 31 2014 partially offsetting this were the cash inflows from the maturation of shortterm investments received during the year ended december 31 2013 in the year ended december 31 2013 we began investing excess cash in money market funds and other similar cash equivalents rather than us treasury securities and other shortterm investments as we had in prior periods 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 199 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to cash used in financing activities of 4423 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects the impact of our 2025 senior notes offering in august 2015 partially offset by higher share repurchases as well as the payments of dividends which began in the three months ended december 31 2014 

cash used in financing activities was 4423 million and 1466 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects increased purchases of treasury shares and the first dividend payment made partially offset by lower repayments on our debt 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the senior notes the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of december 31 2015 

 

  

 the obligations related to msci’s uncertain tax positions which are not considered material have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting standards updates 

see note 2 “recent accounting standards updates” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information 

 

 foreign currency risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

for all operations outside the us where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in nonoperating “other expense income net” in our consolidated statement of income 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 178 and 202 respectively of our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily includes clients billed in foreign currency as well as us dollar exposures on nonus dollar foreign operating entities of the 178 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2015 370 was in british pounds sterling 358 was in euros and 216 was in japanese yen of the 202 of nonus dollar exposure for the year ended december 31 2014 383 was in euros 340 was in british pounds sterling and 217 was in japanese yen 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 184 and 178 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets of which twothirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 413 and 431 of our operating expenses including operating expense attributable to income loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees swiss francs euros hungarian forints hong kong dollars chinese yuan and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss resulted from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 22 million 30 million and 24 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

our aggregate retention rates were 930 and 915 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively our core retention rates were 932 and 918 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively for a description of the calculation of our aggregate and core retention rates see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—key financial metrics and drivers— operating metrics—retention rates ” below

sales and client support 

as of december 31 2014 our client coverage offices included approximately 250 sales people and 330 client support people worldwide of these over 95 were located in our new york offices and over 80 were located in our london office in the last few years we have expanded our sales efforts to increase our revenues and our client service efforts to ensure client satisfaction and develop client loyalty in recent years for example we have opened new sales and client coverage offices in santiago chile seoul korea and taipei taiwan and expanded our sales presence in china and the middle east in 2014 we also significantly increased the number of client coverage employees in the philippines and india we have also created more specialized sales and client support teams to increase our impact in each client segment namely hedge funds asset owners financial advisors private wealth managers and broker dealers in the americas we also increased our focus on smaller asset managers and hedge funds financial advisors and insurance firms our sales and client support staff are based in 30 offices around the world enabling us to provide valuable facetoface client service and focus efforts on developing new clients in more locations 

the sophisticated nature of our products and their uses demand a sales and client support staff with strong academic and financial backgrounds most new sales require several facetoface meetings with the prospective client and the sales process for large and complex sales is likely to involve a team from sales client support product management and research for barra and riskmetrics branded products sales and client support personnel are available to onboard new clients and new users which includes providing intensive onsite training in the use of the models data and software applications underlying each product client support also provides ongoing support which may include onsite visits telephone and email support 24 hours five days a week and routine client support needed in connection with the use of the product or how it can help clients 

  

improve their process all of which are included in the recurring subscription fee we believe that the size quality knowledge and experience of our sales and client support staff as well as their proximity to clients differentiate us from our competitors

although we believe the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks service marks the implementation of certain measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use intellectual property of third parties are important to our business and contribute in part to

 item 1a   risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer you should read the section titled “forwardlooking statements” on page 1 for a description of the types of statements that are considered forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index real estate esg and analytics products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data throughout our businesses we utilize certain data provided by third party data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world as of december 31 2014 there were over 200 such data suppliers if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our data suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us for example standard  poor’s competes with us in index products supplies index data that we distribute in our portfolio analytics software products and jointly developed and maintains gics and gics direct with us some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of provision of data by one or more of our significant data suppliers or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the information available for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers have sought and others may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

  

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock inc and its affiliates “blackrock” and in our largest market the united states our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide exchange traded funds “etfs” among other products the fees etf providers charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these etf managers 

moreover clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index and at least one large client has ceased using msci indexes as the basis for a significant number of its index funds in the past in such instances our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the ability of our licensees to cease using our indexes is generally true not just with respect to an index’s use as the basis of an etf but also with respect to its use as the basis of other financial products including mutual funds and institutional funds finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients etfs and institutional funds based on the same indexes a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the use of the same index as the basis of the other type of product 

if we are required to offer clients materially lower assetbased fee percentages with respect to investment products that generate fees based on the assets of such products or our largest clients cease to use our indexes our revenues could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our revenues attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets a decrease in our revenues attributable to these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

clients that use our indexes as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues in addition in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in a product provider’s total expense ratio “ter” in those cases a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for 178 and 164 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 476 and 436 of the revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles among other factors may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product accordingly the value of assets in etfs can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for example as of december 31 2014 the monthend value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indexes was 3733 billion which was 121 higher than the value of such assets as of december 31 2013 and 12 lower than the value of such assets at september 30 2014 

  

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems the internet and our information technology platform and any failures disruptions or instability may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and its components including our data centers and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error cyberterrorism natural disasters power loss or computer viruses could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns occur with respect to our electronic delivery systems the internet or our information technology platform our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services may be materially adversely affected for example we have in recent years experienced denialofservice attacks while we have been able to defend our systems against such attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future we have also experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products after we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and may experience such interruptions and delays in the future with respect to the migrations within existing data centers or to new data centers in response to such issues we have in the past and could again be required to provide service credits we could also experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also incur increased operating expenses to repair replace or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from and defend against such disruptions and attacks accordingly any significant failures disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform electronic delivery systems or the internet may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems against unauthorized data access or disclosure if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation may result in claims against us by our clients or regulatory inquiry or censure which could individually or in the aggregate damage our reputation andor have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures results in a security or data privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indexes from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our equity indexes can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indexes our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have confidentiality policies in place and have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail or we are delayed in implementing such procedures as necessary with respect to a newly acquired business and an employee inadvertently discloses or deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indexes our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our confidentiality policies or information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list etfs or other financial products based on our equity indexes only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our equity indexes if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our equity indexes which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our specialized competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product larger competitors may offer price incentives to expand their market share and may also consolidate with one another or form joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies resulting from an expanded suite of products and services 

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many of the markets for our products including for singlepurpose product companies the internet as a distribution channel has increasingly allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes see “— changes in government regulations including implementation of new or pending financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations — potential and proposed regulation affecting benchmarks ” below 

financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those resulting from weak or volatile economic conditions may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products including by seeking products at a lower cost than what we are able to provide by consolidating their spending with fewer 

  

providers or by selfsourcing certain of their informational needs accordingly competitive pressures may result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development which could individually or in the aggregate result in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above and part i item 1 “business—our competition” above 

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of this industry and the impact of technological change on our products we must continually introduce new products and services enhance including through integration existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services if among other things we fail to accurately predict or respond or adapt to evolving technologies and changing industry standards if we fail to anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely or if competitors in any business line introduce products services systems and processes that are more competitive than ours or that gain greater market acceptance we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results for example we have made and need to continue to make investments in our technology platform in order to provide competitive products and services to our clients from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and platforms and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also presents execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected also see “— if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” below 

if we are unable to manage our operating costs as anticipated or our operating costs are higher than expected our operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs software development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected 

  

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 258 and 251 of our total revenues respectively our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing subscription base failure of one or more of these subscription objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 106 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 921 and 891 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs that are based on our indexes if one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development and marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “— to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions  failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain our current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and other employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract engage and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting enaging or retaining such personnel if the compensation plans that we currently have in place including our cash and equity incentive plans do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel the quality of our products as well as our ability to support and retain our customers and achieve business objectives may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and profitability our growth including in emerging market locations has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow organically or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting training and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all of our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways” below “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise ” above part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below and part i item 1 “business—company history” above 

changes in government regulations including the implementation of new or pending financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license our products or could impose additional costs on us some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted to the extent that our clients are affected by adverse changes in the financial markets ” below 

 

 we may also be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world in addition we may be materially adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 

  

  

  

 on october 20 2011 the european commission issued its proposal for mifidmifir 2 com 2011 0652 and com 2011 0656 agreement in principle has been reached among the european commission parliament and council and we expect that the regulation when adopted and implemented will among other things mandate that where the value of a financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark will be required to ensure that clearing entities and trading venues may license the benchmark and receive relevant price and data feeds and information regarding the composition methodology and pricing of the benchmark for the purposes of clearing and trading it is also expected that access to such information will have to be granted by the benchmark owner within three months of the request and on the same basis as it is provided to other trading venues unless a different basis can be objectively justified because final guidance on the relevant technical standards has not yet been issued by esma it is difficult to predict its full effect on our index business in the event that compliance with this regulation leads to a material change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business materially diminishes our intellectual property rights materially impacts our contractual commitments to our data contributors or causes our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at a reasonable cost or at all it could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

  

on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en which are updated from time to time by esma “guidelines” the guidelines limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the guidelines became effective as of february 17 2013 with respect to newly launched ucits funds they became effective for all ucits funds on february 17 2014 we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines to the extent that esma issues new guidance or different or new interpretations with respect to the guidelines complying with such guidance could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations including a material negative impact on our licensing of index data andor our indexes as the basis of etfs and ucits additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations 

on june 6 2013 esma published its final report setting out principles for benchmarksetting processes in the eu esma2013659 “esma principles” the esma principles are intended to provide a general framework covering all stages of the benchmark setting process including data submission administration calculation publication the use of benchmarks and the continuity of benchmarks the esma principles are nonbinding but esma intends for them to help transition to a potential european union framework for benchmarks and esma will review the esma principles’ application 18 months after their initial publication to the extent that esma determines that the esma principles include requirements for the benchmark administrators that are different from the iosco principles defined below or to the extent that esma’s review of the industry’s implementation of the esma’s principles results in changes and complying with any such additional requirements or changes to the esma principles leads to a material change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business materially diminishes our intellectual property rights materially impacts our contractual commitments to our data contributors or causes our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at reasonable cost or at all there could be a material adverse effect on our index business 

on july 17 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published its final report on principles for financial benchmarks “iosco principles” the iosco principles cover conflicts of interest benchmark quality and integrity methodology requirements procedures related to handling complaints documentation requirements and audit reviews the iosco principles require benchmark administrators to publicly disclose whether they comply with the iosco principles within 12 months of their initial publication iosco will review the extent to which the iosco principles have been implemented within 18 months of publication on july 16 2014 we announced our implementation of the iosco principles to the extent that iosco’s review of industry members’ implementation of the iosco principles results in changes whereby complying with iosco principles leads to a material change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business materially diminishes our intellectual property rights materially impacts our contractual commitments to our data contributors or causes our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at reasonable cost or at all there could be a material adverse effect on our equity and real estate index product lines 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop internally certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them similarly a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that they manage additionally in august 2011 blackrock announced that it was seeking regulatory clearance to create 

  

indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights such claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages or limit our future use of certain technologies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have increasingly pursued or may consider pursuing patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model software application or other relevant product or process we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets from time to time such complaints are filed by or we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow 

  

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts if any of these risks materialize the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to reengineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts our use of certain thirdparty software and data has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased software or data acquisition costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

products we develop or license including our indexes may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new methodologies and products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product or publish a methodology we might have to delay the product or index release for an extended period of time while 

  

we address the problem we may not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors and in certain cases it may be impracticable to correct such errors if undetected errors exist in our products or methodologies or if our products fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release third party claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations andor unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations also see “ —we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products to support our clients’ investment processes ” below 

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities as well as the measurement of the performance of our clients’ equity investments against equity benchmarks if investment in equity markets declines if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities or if they discontinue the use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios volatility in equity markets over an extended period or other factors may lead to an overall decline in the viability of such markets which could reduce new business opportunities for us and our clients to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for our equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our equity indexes could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services during that annual period for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe the annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions can also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected see “ —changes in government regulations including implementation of new or pending financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations — potential and proposed regulation affecting benchmarks ” above 

  

our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted to the extent that our clients are affected by adverse changes in the financial markets 

unfavorable changes in global or domestic financial market conditions may negatively impact the performance and financial viability of our clients the majority of which are in the financial services industry as a result adverse financial market conditions could result in reduced demand for our products and services from our clients due to among other things the closure or consolidation of our clients the inability of our customers to pay for products or services including delayed payment or underpayment prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable 

if we are unable to successfully identify execute and realize synergies from acquisitions or if we experience integration financing or other risks resulting from our acquisitions our financial results may be materially adversely affected 

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions as we continue pursuing selective acquisitions to support our growth strategy we seek to be a disciplined acquirer and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices in addition our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into our business we cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses or that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate in addition our past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt our operations any acquisition could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see part i item 1 “business—company history” above 

  

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant portion of our revenues from our indexlinked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenues and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in nonoperating “other expense income net” in our consolidated statement of income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 178 and 164 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a large majority of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 143 and 151 respectively of our total revenues including revenues attributable to income from discontinued operations net of income taxes were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2014 545 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 238 were in british pounds sterling and 126 were in japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2013 539 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 229 were in british pounds sterling and 130 were in japanese yen 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 431 and 428 of our total operating expenses including operating expenses in income from discontinued operations net of income taxes for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees euros swiss francs hungarian forints hong kong dollars and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the united states 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency either a gain or a loss resulted from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with intercompany loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies as a result of these positions we recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of 30 million and 24 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products to support our clients’ investment processes 

our products support the investment processes of our clients which relate to in the aggregate trillions of dollars in assets use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that our clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts based on what may be alleged to be even a small error in certain of our products our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or failure to provide services under our client contracts however these provisions do not always eliminate liability entirely and may have certain exceptions that could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws 

claims against us even if their outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations in addition the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult if not impossible to predict which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

on november 20 2014 we completed a private offering of 8000 million in aggregate principal amount of 5250 senior notes due 2024 the “notes” and entered into a new 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement our “2014 revolving credit agreement” we used the net proceeds from the offering of the notes together with cash on hand to prepay in full the 7948 million of outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated senior secured term loan facility see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for additional information regarding our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the notes as of december 31 2014 we had 8000 million of outstanding indebtedness under the notes and 2000 million of undrawn aggregate commitments under our 2014 revolving credit agreement which includes 250 million for the issuance of letters of credit any borrowings under our 2014 revolving credit agreement may be voluntarily prepaid and reborrowed however the undrawn portion of the aggregate commitments is subject to an unused commitment fee 

the notes and our 2014 revolving credit agreement are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by our direct or indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5 of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated assets other than certain excluded subsidiaries the “subsidiary guarantors” amounts due under our 2014 revolving credit agreement are our and the subsidiary guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the notes and any of our other unsecured unsubordinated debt senior to any of our subordinated debt and effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indenture dated as of november 20 

  

2014 the “indenture governing our notes” among us each of the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing and future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt in addition the indenture governing our notes restricts our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create assume incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such nonguarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the notes on a pari passu basis 

our 2014 revolving credit agreement also requires us to comply with the following two financial ratio maintenance covenants which are tested at least quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis i our maximum consolidated leverage ratio must not exceed 375100 and ii our minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio must be at least 400100 under the terms of our 2014 revolving credit agreement certain increases or decreases in our consolidated leverage ratio may result in an increase or decrease in the fees applicable to i outstanding borrowings under such facility and ii undrawn commitments under such facility in each case in a predetermined percentage amount the “applicable margin” if we experience as of a scheduled quarterly test date an increase in our consolidated leverage ratio above a threshold amount specified in our 2014 revolving credit agreement the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings andor the fee rate on our unused commitments will rise by the applicable margin consequently any increase in our consolidated leverage ratio could result in higher debt service costs under such facility even if we do not have borrowings outstanding under such facility in addition our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes contain certain affirmative covenants any of these restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financings and to engage in business activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness this could further exacerbate the risks described above 

we may need to incur additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes restrict but do not completely prohibit us from doing so our 2014 revolving credit agreement provides for an incremental facility that allows us to increase aggregate commitments by an additional 2000 million under certain circumstances in addition the indenture governing our notes allows us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances accordingly we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time under our existing debt agreements and otherwise to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of indebtedness could increase specifically a high level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements there could be a default under the terms of such agreements which could result in an acceleration of repayment 

if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes there could be a default under the terms of these debt agreements our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants including meeting financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants or meet such financial ratios and tests and any such default under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities 

additionally if certain events of default occur continue or remain uncured under our debt agreements we are required to repurchase redeem repay or prepay as the case may be the debt under such agreement prior to maturity andor such debt could become accelerated and immediately due and payable for example upon the occurrence of specified changes of control in our ownership the holders of the notes have the right to compel us to repurchase all or part of the notes in cash at a price equal to 1010 of the aggregate principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued interest additionally the holders of the notes may in connection with certain events of default accelerate the principal amount of the notes together with accrued and unpaid interest and declare the same to be due and payable after giving the required notice likewise under our 2014 revolving credit agreement the lenders may in connection with certain events of default elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees to be due and payable 

our debt agreements also contain crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions pursuant to which a default is deemed to have occurred under such agreement if a default or acceleration occurs under another debt agreement for example our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes contain crossdefault provisions relating to nonpayment by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with debt aggregating 500 million or more subject to certain cure periods if any of the above events should occur we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness additionally we may not be able to amend our debt agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash however our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control if we are unable to generate a sufficient amount of cash our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity however we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 

  

absent sufficient cash flow and the ability to refinance we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations however the terms of our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale accordingly we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations on our indebtedness 

increased costs of financing a reduction in the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and access to capital fluctuations in the levels of interest rates and inflation or a downgrade of our credit rating could materially adversely affect our liquidity operating expenses and results 

at december 31 2014 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 2014 revolving credit agreement and all of our outstanding longterm debt was subject to a fixed interest rate adverse conditions in the domestic and global financial markets could however increase our costs for additional financing and negatively affect our ability to refinance repurchase redeem repay or prepay as the case may be our debt at or prior to maturity raise capital or fund other types of obligations our access to capital is also impacted by changes in interest rates and inflation which could restrict the availability to us of shortterm and longterm funding recent interest rates in the united states have been at historically low levels and any increase in these rates could increase our interest expense and reduce our funds available for operations and other purposes with respect to newly incurred debt or borrowings if any under our 2014 revolving credit agreement additionally any downgrades to our credit rating or outlook may increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing 

if we borrow under our 2014 revolving credit agreement such indebtedness would bear interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars libor tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market increases in the interest rate generally and particularly when coupled with any significant variable rate indebtedness could materially adversely impact our interest expenses to the extent we borrow under our 2014 revolving credit agreement we are not required to enter into interest rate swaps to hedge such indebtedness if we decide not to enter into hedges on such indebtedness our interest expense on such indebtedness will fluctuate based on libor or other variable interest rates consequently we may have difficulties servicing such unhedged indebtedness and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be materially adversely affected 

if we do enter into interest rate swap agreements developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivative instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivative instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our interest rate hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to seamlessly provide clients with products and customer service we must protect our equipment and the information stored in our computerbased networks and databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns internet failures computer viruses unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks 

  

on sites where we are located and other events we also depend on accessible physical office facilities and hardware for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there can be no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events additionally we may incur significant data recovery costs following any such event and the scope of recovery will depend on among other things the effectiveness of our business continuity plans in mitigating the risks associated with the particular event that has occurred 

such events could also have a material adverse effect on our clients for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could materially adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls customs duties sanctions compliance tax penalties levies or assessments and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations in connection with the acquisitions of riskmetrics and ipd we acquired new offices in 10 nonus locations since 2010 we have also opened offices in santiago seoul taipei and shanghai we intend to further grow our presence in emerging market locations a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the united states and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

in order to penetrate markets outside of the united states we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market for example the continued success of ipd’s products is dependent on understanding local real estate markets and maintaining relationships with local real estate industry bodies in the jurisdictions in which ipd operates demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and esg and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the united states there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

  

we may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act 2010 we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 

our ability to attract and retain customers is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers prospects and the public generally which could negatively impact among other things our ability to attract and retain customers employees and suppliers as well as suitable candidates for acquisition and or other combinations see also “— any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above “— we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our equity indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected ” above and “— if our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects malfunctions or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation ” above 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities in various jurisdictions 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities from time to time we also implement changes to our global corporate structure changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate such changes include but are not limited to proposed legislation to reform us taxation of international business activities 

although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

  

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 19985 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2014 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired 

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the new york stock exchange for example the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial conditions and the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities see “— changes in government regulations including implementation of new or pending financial regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

in connection with our ipo and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses 

the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate in the future for a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control one possible outcome of such fluctuation could be a decline in the value of your investment for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plans 

as of december 31 2014 112072469 shares of our common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of december 31 2014 we had issued 6377840 and 159194 shares of common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent 

  

directors’ equity compensation plan respectively in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 4257779 shares of msci common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to officers and certain employees of riskmetrics pursuant to the riskmetrics group inc 2000 stock option plan riskmetrics group inc 2004 stock option plan institutional shareholder services holdings inc equity incentive plan and riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan collectively the “rmg plans” as of december 31 2014 we had issued 3667188 shares of common stock under the rmg plans in june 2010 we also filed a registration statement assuming 3060090 shares available under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan as of december 31 2014 we had issued 2023798 shares of common stock under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan which terminated on june 30 2012 see note 10 “share based compensation— deferred stock awards and— stock option awards ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of the company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your common stock in an acquisition 

  

we may not be able to maintain payments of dividends at current levels and the failure to do so may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

on september 17 2014 our board of directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders we paid our first quarterly dividend on october 31 2014 and our board of directors declared our second quarterly dividend on february 3 3015 which is to be paid on march 13 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on february 20 2015 in each case in an amount of 018 per share of common stock although we plan to continue to pay such regular quarterly dividends at an anticipated initial aggregate annual dividend rate of 072 per share there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so or that we will achieve an annual dividend rate in any particular amount our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 

our cash dividend policy is based upon our board of directors’ assessment of our financial condition and the general business environment in which we operate at the time of declaration any future declaration and payment of cash dividends to our shareholders depends on the assessment of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control and a change in any one or more factors could affect our dividend policy these factors include our results of operations and liquidity future prospects for earnings and cash flows our available cash on hand and anticipated cash needs the level and timing of capital expenditures principal repayments and other capital needs our ability to comply with current or future financial and negative covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments including the incurrence covenants contained in our 2014 revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes tax treatment of dividends in the united states legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other provisions of law in any applicable jurisdiction and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in light of the prevailing conditions at the time of such assessment as a result we can give no assurance that we will in the future choose or be able to declare or pay a cash dividend maintain our current level of dividends or increase them over time our failure to declare or pay a dividend a reduction in the level of such dividend or the discontinuance of such dividend could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors may not result in enhanced value to shareholders and may negatively affect our share price 

on february 4 2014 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 3000 million worth of shares of our common stock which was subsequently increased to 8500 million the “2014 repurchase program” share repurchases made pursuant to the 2014 repurchase program may take place through december 31 2016 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time based on market and other conditions pursuant to the 2014 repurchase program on september 18 2014 we entered into a 3000 million accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreement with goldman sachs  co “gsco” under which on september 19 2014 we paid gsco 3000 million in cash and received approximately 45 million shares of our common stock the total number of shares to be repurchased will be based primarily on an arithmetic average of the volumeweighted average prices of our common stock on each trading day during the repurchase period this average price will be capped such that only under limited circumstances will we be required to deliver shares or pay cash at settlement we may receive from gsco additional shares at or prior to maturity of this asr agreement in may 2015 

the 2014 repurchase program carries risks and uncertainties including among other things that the authorized purchases will not be completed within the expected timing or will not be made at the best possible price additionally we are permitted to and may discontinue the 2014 repurchase program at any time including without limitation upon determining that we have insufficient cash flows to continue to execute such program any such discontinuation or inability to continue to execute the 2014 repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline accordingly there can be no assurance that we will pursue or be successful in completing the execution of the remaining 5500 million authorized under the 2014 repurchase program or any future repurchase program additionally the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price 

  

of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our shares as a result any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources

overview 

for more than 40 years msci’s researchbased models and methodologies have helped the world’s leading investors build and manage better portfolios clients rely on our products and services for deeper insights into the drivers of performance and risk in their portfolios broad asset class coverage and innovative research and can use our products to help design and implement their investment strategies our line of products and services includes indexes analytical tools data real estate benchmarks and environmental social and governance “esg” research msci serves 98 of the top 100 global asset managers as ranked by pi in december 2014 our products and services address multiple markets asset classes and geographies and are sold to a diverse client base including asset owners such as pension funds endowments foundations central banks family offices and insurance companies institutional and retail asset managers such as managers of pension assets mutual funds exchange traded funds “etfs” real estate hedge funds and private wealth and financial intermediaries such as banks brokerdealers exchanges custodians and investment consultants they are used in many areas of the investment process including portfolio construction and rebalancing performance benchmarking and attribution risk management regulatory and client reporting indexlinked investment product creation asset allocation the assessment of corporate management of esg risks and opportunities investment manager selection and investment research as of december 31 2014 we had offices in 35 cities in 22 countries to help serve our diverse client base with 510 of our revenues coming from clients in the americas 365 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 125 in asia and australia 

prior to march 31 2014 msci reported financial results for two segments the performance and risk business and the governance business on march 17 2014 msci entered into a definitive agreement to sell iss which together with the cfra product line disposed of in march 2013 made up the company’s governance segment as a result beginning in the first quarter of 2014 the company began operating and reporting as a single business segment on april 30 2014 we completed the sale of iss 

our principal sales model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for an annual fee paid upfront additionally our recurring subscriptions include our managed services offering whereby we oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients fees attributable to annual recurring subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered additionally a portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades we generate revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmarks reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our products offered by ipd group limited “ipd” that are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates we also receive revenues from onetime fees related to implementation historical or customized reports advisory and consulting services and from certain products and services that are designed for onetime usage 

  

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue growth for the company in total and by product category as well as operating profit growth in addition we focus on operating metrics including run rates and retention rates to manage the business our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our operating profits into excess cash in the future our revenue growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing product offerings including combining existing product features or data derived from our products to create new products and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we have significantly invested in and expanded our operating functions and infrastructure including additional product management sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world and additional staff and supporting technology for our research and our data operations and technology functions the “enhanced investment program” 

the purpose of this enhanced investment program is to maximize our mediumterm revenue and operating income growth while at the same time ensuring that msci will remain a leading provider of investment decision support tools into the future as a result the rate of growth of our investments have in recent years exceeded that of our revenues which has slowed the growth of or even reduced our operating profit for example for the year ended december 31 2014 our revenues grew by 91 but our operating income decreased by 09 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 due in part to increased investment in our business we have largely completed our enhanced investment program and as a result we expect margin expansion to begin in the second half of 2015 exclusive of any nonrecurring charges we may incur 

changes in presentation 

prior to march 31 2014 we reported financial results for two segments the performance and risk business and the governance business on march 17 2014 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell institutional shareholder services inc which together with the cfra product line disposed of in march 2013 made up our governance segment as a result beginning in the first quarter of 2014 we began operating and reporting as a single reportable segment and the operating results of iss and the cfra product line were reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented we completed the sale of iss on april 30 2014 

in addition for periods prior to march 31 2014 we reported energy and commodity analytics products separately as its own product category for disclosures related to operating revenues run rate and aggregate and core retention rates beginning with the three month period ended march 31 2014 we reported the results of energy and commodity analytics products as part of the risk management analytics product category as we view the product offerings and customer base of the energy and commodities analytics products to be similar in nature to those in the risk management analytics product category prior periods have also been presented to reflect this change in categorization 

key financial metrics and drivers 

revenues 

our revenues are grouped into the following three product andor service categories 

index real estate and esg products 

our index real estate and esg products category includes subscription fees from msci equity index data and ipd and esg research and analytics products fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indexes fees from nonrecurring licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from real estate products we also generate a limited amount of revenues based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes 

  

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indexes also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client clients who utilize our esg research and analytics products and services pay an annual subscription fee and access these products and services via a webbased application data feed or thirdparty vendor 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes investment inflows and outflows and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee which in some cases may be based on a product provider’s total expense ratio times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period additionally revenues from our indexlinked futures and options contracts vary based on the volume of trading 

risk management analytics products 

our risk management analytics product category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to our risk management analytics products including our two major products riskmanager and barraone we also recognize recurring subscriptions related to our managed services offering in which our staff oversees the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients other products in this category include hedgeplatform wealthbench credit manager and investorforce the products offer a consistent risk assessment framework for managing and monitoring investments in a variety of asset classes across an organization we are able to grow our revenues by licensing additional users and locations as well as selling additional products and services 

riskmanager is used by clients for daily analysis measuring and monitoring of market risk at fund and firm levels for sensitivity and stress testing and interactive whatif analysis riskmanager is a highly scalable platform accessed by clients via a license to a secure interactive webbased application service as a fully outsourced risk reporting service or as a web service in which a client’s systems access riskmetrics core risk elements by connecting directly to our systems 

barraone powered by the barra integrated model provides clients with global multiasset class risk analysis using barra fundamental factors the product is accessed by clients via a secure interactive webbased session web services or on an outsourced basis 

clients generally subscribe to the other products in this category on an annual recurring basis 

portfolio management analytics products 

our portfolio management analytics product category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barra aegis and our proprietary risk data in barra aegis and barra portfolio manager equity models direct products and our proprietary equity risk data incorporated in thirdparty software application offerings  eg barra on vendors this category also includes a limited amount of revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to our fixed income portfolio analytics products 

barra aegis is a sophisticated software application for equity risk management and portfolio analysis that is powered by our proprietary equity risk data it is an integrated suite of equity investment analytics modules specifically designed to help clients actively manage their equity risk against their expected returns identify returns attributable to stock selection skills and backtest portfolio construction strategies over time a base subscription for use in portfolio analysis typically involves a subscription to barra aegis and various risk data modules a client

see “item 1 business—business segments products and services” above for additional details of the products and services that we offer 

operating metrics 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from thencurrent subscriptions and investment product licenses we provide to our clients under renewable contracts or agreements assuming all contracts or agreements that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects for etf fees the market value on the last trading day of the period and for nonetf funds and futures and options the most recent periodic fee earned under such license or subscription the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future revenues there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in run rate between periods may be attributable to among other things increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indexes the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes price changes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions 

the following table sets forth our run rates and the percentage growth over the periods indicated 

 

 december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 

total run rate grew by 77 to 10067 million as of december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 total subscription run rate grew by 72 to 8322 million as of december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and the acquisition of gmi ratings subscription run rate grew by 81 

run rate attributable to index real estate and esg products grew by 112 to 5890 million subscription run rate from index real estate and esg products grew by 116 to 4145 million excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and the acquisition of gmi ratings subscription run rate rose 109 the growth in index real estate and esg products was driven primarily by equity index benchmark and data products and aided by strong growth in esg and real estate products 

assetbased fee run rate from index real estate and esg products increased 103 to 1746 million at december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 the increase was primarily driven by inflows into etfs linked to msci indexes and nonetf passive funds 

  

as of december 31 2014 the value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indexes was 3733 billion representing an increase of 121 from 3329 billion as of december 31 2013 of the 3733 billion of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indexes as of december 31 2014 508 were linked to indexes related to developed markets outside of the us 235 were linked to emerging market indexes 200 were linked to us market indexes and 57 were linked to other global indexes 

risk management analytics products run rate increased 28 to 3103 million at december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes run rate increased 54 driven by growth from riskmanager investorforce and hedgeplatform products 

portfolio management analytics products run rate increased 41 to 1073 million at december 31 2014 from december 31 2013 excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates run rate grew by 59 

december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 

total run rate grew by 100 to 9349 million as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 total subscription run rate grew by 74 to 7766 million as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 excluding the impact of the acquisition of investorforce total subscription run rate grew by 60 as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 

subscription run rate from the index real estate and esg products grew by 99 to 3715 million at december 31 2013 relative to december 31 2012 driven by growth in equity index benchmark and data products 

on october 2 2012 the vanguard group inc announced its decision to change the target benchmarks of 22 of its etfs from msci’s equity indexes the “vanguard etfs” as a result of this announcement we excluded the 1385 billion of assets in the 22 vanguard etfs linked to msci equity indexes as of december 31 2012 for purposes of calculating the index real estate and esg assetbased fee run rate which resulted in a decrease of 248 million the average value of assets in the 22 vanguard etfs linked to msci equity indexes was 1221 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the total average value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indexes of 3491 billion 

assetbased fee run rate from index real estate and esg products increased by 246 to 1583 million at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 the increase was primarily driven by inflows into and higher market performance by etfs linked to msci indexes 

as of december 31 2013 assets under management “aum” in etfs linked to msci indexes were 3329 billion down 694 billion or 173 compared to december 31 2012 during the year ended december 31 2013 mscilinked etfs were impacted by market increases of 339 billion and net outflows of 1033 billion if the aum related to those vanguard etfs which transitioned earlier in 2013 were excluded from the december 31 2012 balance aum in etfs linked to msci indexes would have risen 691 billion or 262 compared to december 31 2012 

risk management analytics products run rate increased 97 to 3020 million at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 excluding the impact attributable to investorforce run rate grew by 60 run rate continued to benefit from solid growth in the riskmanager and barraone products changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively benefited run rate by 12 million compared to december 31 2012 

portfolio management analytics products run rate declined 61 to 1031 million at december 31 2013 from december 31 2012 yearoveryear run rate was negatively impacted in part by product swaps totaling 11 million and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which lowered run rate by an additional 24 million 

  

subscription sales 

the following table sets forth our net new recurring subscription sales and nonrecurring sales 

 

 retention rates 

other key metrics are our “aggregate retention rate” and “core retention rate” which are collectively referred to as “retention rates” these metrics are important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our core retention rate is calculated in the same way as our aggregate retention rate except that the core retention rate does not treat switches between products as a cancellation our aggregate and core retention rates are computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate or core retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indexes or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes aggregate and core retention rates for a nonannual period reflect the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

   

 the following table sets forth our core retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 the quarterly retention rates are calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded cancellations of 170 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 170 million to derive 681 million of annualized cancellations this 681 million was then divided by the 7766 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 87 the 87 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 913 for the fourth quarter 

for the calculation of the core retention rate the same methodology was used except the amount of cancellations in the quarter was reduced by the amount of product swaps for example in fourth quarter 2014 we had product swaps of 07 million which was subtracted from the 170 million of actual cancels to derive core cancels of 163 million this 163 million was annualized to derive 652 million of annualized cancellations which was then divided by the 7766 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 83 the 83 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive the core retention rate of 917 for the fourth quarter 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 311 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter historically retention rates have generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year 

expenses 

we group our operating expenses into five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data operations and technology software engineering and product management functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits occupancy market data fees information technology and other miscellaneous costs the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

selling general and administrative 

this category includes among other things compensation and benefits costs for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses were for occupancy thirdparty consulting costs and information technology

during the year ended november 30 2010 msci’s management approved committed to and initiated a plan to restructure the company’s operations due to its acquisition of riskmetrics group inc “riskmetrics” the plan was substantially completed by december 31 2011 restructuring included expenses associated with the elimination of overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs the termination of overlapping vendor contracts and the discontinuance of the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets 

other expense income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments transition services income associated with our sale of iss foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items 

critical accounting policies and estimates

functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in nonoperating “other expense income net” in our consolidated statement of income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 178 and 164 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively while a substantial portion of our fees for indexlinked investment products are invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 143 and 151 respectively of our total revenues including revenues attributable to income from discontinued operations net of income taxes were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2014 545 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 238 were in british pounds sterling and 126 were in japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2013 539 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 229 were in british pounds sterling and 130 were in japanese yen 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 431 and 428 of our operating expenses including operating expense attributable to income from discontinued operations net of income taxes for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling indian rupees euros swiss francs hungarian forints hong kong dollars and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the united states 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency a gain or loss results from the change in value of the functional currency we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with intercompany loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 30 million 24 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively

service efforts to ensure client satisfaction and develop client loyalty in recent years for example we have opened new sales and client coverage offices in seoul korea and taipei taiwan and expanded our sales presence in china and the middle east in 2013 we also significantly increased the number of client coverage and sales people in canada the philippines and the us and in 2014 we have opened a sales office in santiago chile we have also created more specialized sales and client support teams to increase our impact in each client segment namely hedge funds asset owners financial advisors private wealth managers and broker dealers in the americas we also increased our focus on smaller asset managers and hedge funds financial advisors and insurance firms our sales and client support staff are based in 29 offices around the world enabling us to provide valuable facetoface client service and focus efforts on developing new clients in more locations 

the sophisticated nature of our products and their uses demand a sales and client support staff with strong academic and financial backgrounds most new sales require several facetoface meetings with the prospective client and the sales process for large and complex sales is likely to involve a team from sales client support product management and research for barra and riskmetrics branded products sales and client support personnel are available to onboard new clients and new users which includes providing intensive onsite training in the use of the models data and software applications underlying each product client support also provides ongoing support which may include onsite visits telephone and email support 24 hours five days a week and routine client support needed in connection with the use of the product or how it can help clients improve their process all of which are included in the recurring subscription fee we believe that the size quality knowledge and experience of our sales and client support staff as well as their proximity to clients differentiate us from our competitors 

product development and production 

we take a coordinated team approach to product development and production our product management research data operations and technology and application development departments are at the center of this process despite the challenging market environment we remained committed to our product development and production efforts and in some cases increased these efforts 

utilizing a deep understanding of the investment process worldwide our research department develops reviews and enhances our various methodologies and models our global data operations and technology team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement proprietary data production and quality control our application development team builds our sophisticated software applications as part of our product development process we also commonly undertake extensive consultations with our clients and other market participants to understand their specific needs and investment process requirements our product management team facilitates this collaborative product development and production approach 

 

   

 within the governance research department iss’s policy board works to ensure iss’s voting policies are developed and applied within a framework of corporate governance best practices each year iss solicits broad feedback from multiple constituencies including through an annual policy survey of our institutional clients and other investors corporations and other market participants to assess opinions on emerging topics and practices direct outreach with institutional investors corporate board members and executives is then done through multiple and geographically diverse channels including inperson and telephonic roundtables participants are invited to share their perspectives on corporate governance issues including board structure executive compensation mergers and acquisitions and corporate accountability to ensure that our standard voting policies are aligned with the views of our institutional clients those discussions result in the creation of draft policies for the coming year which are then published for public comment before being finalized iss’s engagement with key governance stakeholders continues year round through inperson meetings speaking engagements and other channels

intellectual property and other proprietary rights 

we consider many aspects of our products processes and services to be proprietary we have registered among others “msci” “barra” “fea” “investorforce” “ipd” and “riskmetrics” as trademarks or service marks in the us and in certain foreign countries we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks service marks and copyrights as appropriate from time to time we also file patent applications to protect our proprietary rights we currently hold 21 us and foreign patents and have five us and foreign patents pending additionally many of our products processes and services require the use of intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products processes and services 

although we believe the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks service marks the implementation of certain measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use intellectual property of third parties are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights or any one license to use third party intellectual property for a discussion of the risks associated with legal protection of our intellectual property and other rights infringement claims and the ability to obtain or renew licenses for third party intellectual property see part i item 1a “risk factors— legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights”

 item 1a   risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer you should read the section titled “forwardlooking statements” beginning on page 1 for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index analytics and governance products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data 

  

throughout our businesses we utilize certain data provided by third party data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world as of december 31 2013 there were over 200 such data suppliers if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our data suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us for example iss relies on a data feed agreement with broadridge which allows for a large number of proxy ballots to be received and proxy votes to be processed electronically minimizing the manual aspects of the proxy voting process and limiting the risk of error inherent in manual processes if the data feed agreement with broadridge was terminated we would have to incur significant expenses in order to input our clients’ voting instructions directly into broadridge’s proprietary electronic voting systems and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers have sought and others may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the united states our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to decrease our fees correspondingly or otherwise lead to a reduction of our fees in certain cases see “— our revenues and earnings attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets or other factors that are tied to the calculation of our fees for certain indexlinked investment products ” below competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide exchange traded funds “etfs” among other products the fees etf providers charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers for example on october 15 2012 blackrock announced that its ishares etf business launched a new series of funds based on certain msci investable market indexes pursuant to a license with fee levels that are lower than those the company currently receives with respect to existing ishares etfs based on msci’s 

  

standard indexes additionally clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example on october 2 2012 we announced that vanguard had informed the company of its decision to no longer use msci’s indexes as the basis for certain of its index funds including both etf and other share classes beginning in 2013 representing a loss of run rate of 248 million at december 31 2012 the ability of our licensees to cease using our indexes is generally true not just with respect to an index’s use as the basis of an etf but also with respect to its use as the basis of other financial products including mutual funds and institutional funds finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients etfs and institutional funds based on the same indexes a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the same index as the basis of the other type of product 

our revenues and earnings attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets or other factors that are tied to the calculation of our fees for certain indexlinked investment products a decrease in our fees for these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

clients that use our indexes as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues in addition in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in a product provider’s total expense ratio “ter” in those cases a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for 144 and 148 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 411 and 433 of the revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example as of december 31 2013 the monthend value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indexes was 3329 billion which was 173 lower than the value of such assets as of december 31 2012 and 100 higher than the value of such assets at september 30 2013 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 235 and 250 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 88 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 870 and 817 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs based on msci indexes see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above 

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and 

  

regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license our products or could impose additional costs upon us some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 we may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world in addition we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 

 

  

   

on october 20 2011 the european commission issued its proposal for mifidmifir 2 com 2011 0652 and com 2011 0656 agreement in principle has been reached between the european commission parliament and council and we expect that the regulation when adopted and implemented will among other things mandate that where the value of a financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark will be required to ensure that clearing entities and trading venues will be entitled to licenses to the benchmark as well as to relevant price and data feeds and information regarding the composition methodology and pricing of the benchmark and that access to such information will have to be granted by the benchmark owner within three months of the request at a fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate unless there are objective reasons to charge otherwise we still await the final text as well as the results of esma’s issuance of further guidance on the relevant technical standards thus it is difficult to predict its full effect on our index business but complying with this regulation to the extent that it leads to a material change in our business practices or reduces our ability to offer indexes in the european union on terms of our choosing as it appears it will could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en which are updated from time to time by esma “guidelines” the guidelines limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the guidelines became effective as of february 17 2013 with respect to newly launched ucits funds they became effective for all ucits funds on february 17 2014 we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines although the full effects of the guidelines will be largely unknown until we have more clarification from esma andor individual regulators complying with any related requirements could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations including a negative impact on our licensing of index data andor our indexes as the basis of etfs and ucits additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations 

on june 6 2013 esma published its final report setting out principles for benchmarksetting processes in the eu esma2013659 “esma principles” the esma principles are intended to provide a general framework covering all stages of the benchmark setting process including data submission administration calculation publication the use of benchmarks and the continuity of benchmarks the esma principles are nonbinding but esma intends them to help transition to a potential european union framework for benchmarks and esma will review the esma principles’ application 18 months after their initial publication we are assessing the impact that compliance with the esma principles could have on our equity and real estate index product lines but complying with esma principles to the extent that it leads to a material change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business materially diminishes our intellectual property rights materially impacts our contractual commitments to our data contributors or causes our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at reasonable cost or at all could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

on july 17 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published its final report on principles for financial benchmarks “iosco principles” the iosco principles cover conflicts of interest benchmark quality and integrity methodology requirements procedures related to handling complaints documentation requirements and audit reviews the iosco principles require benchmark administrators to publicly disclose whether they comply with the iosco principles within 12 months of their initial publication iosco will review the extent to which the iosco principles have been implemented within 18 months of publication we are assessing the impact that compliance with the iosco principles could have on our equity and real estate index product lines but complying with iosco principles to the extent that it leads to a material change in our business practices or our 

  

ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business materially diminishes our intellectual property rights materially impacts our contractual commitments to our data contributors or causes our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at reasonable cost or at all could have a material adverse effect on our equity and real estate index product lines 

 

  

 following a consultation conducted by the european securities and markets authority “esma” with respect to the proxy advisory industry in europe esma has decided to require the proxy advisory industry to develop its own code of conduct which will be implemented under a complyorexplain regime esma is recommending the development of a code of conduct that focuses on identifying disclosing and managing conflicts of interest and that fosters transparency esma will review the development of the code of conduct during 2016 and may reconsider its position if no substantial progress has been made by that time to address esma’s recommendations six proxy advisors are currently working on a set of best practice principles which are expected to be released in march 2014 on december 12 2012 the european commission also released an action plan that contemplated considering an initiative with a view to improving the transparency and conflicts of interest frameworks applicable to proxy advisors additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe such as canada have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations 

at this point we are unable to determine whether the sec the european commission or other regulatory bodies will pursue rulemaking or legislation on these matters and if so the extent to which any rule or legislation might impact our businesses including the process by which we provide proxy research and voting services to clients the manner in which iss operates as a proxy advisory firm the business model that provides for both voting services to investor clients and governance advice to corporate clients or otherwise however as with any regulatory change or the introduction of new 

  

legislation we may have to change business practices and operational procedures and incur costs in response to possible modifications to the proxy system that could result from any rulemaking or legislation that stems from the sec’s concept release the adoption of the code of conduct encouraged by esma or action by the european commission or other regulatory bodies 

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth including in emerging market locations has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow organically or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting training and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all of our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways” and “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise ” below part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and part i item 1 “business—company history” 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop internally certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example in august 2011 blackrock announced that it was seeking regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage see “— a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation could damage our reputation andor result in claims against us by our clients or regulators and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example on september 14 2012 we received a wells notice from the staff of the sec in connection with allegations that an iss employee provided confidential information about how clients voted their 

  

proxies to proxy solicitors in return for cash and other gifts the employee was subsequently terminated from his position and we cooperated with investigations of both the sec and the us department of justice in settling with the sec and without admitting or denying the sec’s allegations iss consented to the entry of an administrative order requiring that iss comply with relevant provisions of the securities laws pay a 300000 civil monetary penalty and retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of iss’s supervisory and compliance policies and procedures if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures results in a security or privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indexes from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indexes can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indexes our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have confidentiality policies in place and have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail or we are delayed in implementing such procedures as necessary with respect to a newly acquired business and an employee inadvertently discloses or deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indexes our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our confidentiality policies or information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list etfs or other financial products based on our equity indexes only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our equity indexes if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our equity indexes which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition 

  

the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights such claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages or limit our future use of integral technologies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have increasingly pursued or may consider pursuing patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model software application or other relevant product or process we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time such complaints are filed by or we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to re 

  

engineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts our use of certain third party software and data has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased software or data acquisition costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industry in which we operate and the impact of technological change on our products we must continually introduce new products and services enhance 

  

including through integration existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services if among other things we fail to accurately anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely or if competitors in any business line introduce products services systems and processes that are better than ours or that gain greater market acceptance we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results for example we have made and need to continue to make investments in our technology platform in order to provide competitive products and services to our clients from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and platforms and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also presents execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected also see “— if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product there may also be consolidation among our competitors in the form of joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for better capitalized competitors 

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many cases including for singlepurpose product companies the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes profit margin considerations including those arising from financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients resulting from current economic conditions may lead certain clients to seek products at a lower cost than what we provide see “ — changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations — potential and proposed regulation affecting benchmarks ” above 

these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above and part i item 1 “business—our competition” 

  

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring portfolios to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a portion of our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our equity indexes could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services during that annual period for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe the annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions can also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected see “ —changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations — potential and proposed regulation affecting benchmarks ” above 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development and marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “— to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions ” above and part i item 1 “business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if we are unable to manage our operating costs as anticipated or our operating costs are higher than expected our operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs software development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by certain factors that are beyond our control including global financial market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation 

unfavorable changes in global financial market conditions may negatively impact the financial viability of our clients the majority of which are in the financial services industry resulting in reduced demand for our products and services due to the closure or consolidation of our clients the inability of our customers to pay for products or services prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable our cash flows may also be impacted by changes in interest rates currency exchange rates inflation and delayed payment or underpayment by our customers which could restrict our access to capital markets adverse changes in the financial markets could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

additionally as a result of the global financial crisis the us congress undertook major financial reform which led to the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank act the doddfrank act could have a significant impact on many aspects of the way in which the financial services industry conducts business and has and will continue to impose substantial new regulation on and regulatory oversight of a wide variety of financial services institutions although many of the effects of the doddfrank act will be largely unknown until all of the regulations have been finalized and implemented complying with its requirements could negatively impact the business operations and financial viability of many of our clients which in turn could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any acquisition could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see part i item 1 “business—company history” 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our indexlinked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the us where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in nonoperating “other expense income net” in our consolidated statement of income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 144 and 148 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 151 and 126 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2013 539 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 229 were in british pounds sterling and 130 were in japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2012 583 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 218 were in japanese yen and 121 were in british pounds sterling 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 428 and 345 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling euros swiss francs indian rupees hungarian forints hong kong dollars and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency a gain or loss results from the change in 

  

value of the functional currency we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with intercompany loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 24 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our performance and risk products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our governance products and services support the proxy voting processes of our clients our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or the failure to provide the services provided in client contracts however these provisions may not always eliminate liability entirely and may have certain exceptions that could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

on may 4 2012 we amended and restated our credit facility which originally consisted of a senior secured term loan b facility and revolving credit facility entered into on june 1 2010 as amended by amendment no 1 dated as of february 4 2011 and amendment no 2 dated as of march 14 2011 the credit facility as so amended and restated the “amended and restated credit facility” the amended and restated credit facility provides for the incurrence of a new senior secured 5year term loan a facility in an aggregate amount of 8800 million “term loan” and a new 1000 million senior secured revolving facility “revolving credit facility” the proceeds of the amended and restated credit facility together with cash on hand were used to prepay the remaining outstanding principal of the existing term loan b facility on december 12 2013 we entered into amendment no 1 to the amended and restated credit facility the “new amended and restated credit facility” that among other things extended the maturity dates of the term loan and revolving credit facility to december 12 2018 and modified the amortization schedule see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for additional information regarding amendment no1 

as of december 31 2013 we had 8100 million of indebtedness under the new amended and restated credit facility as amended 203 million in current maturities and 7897 million in long term debt 3584 million of cash and cash equivalents and no shortterm investments 

the new amended and restated credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien 

  

and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future material domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our material domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the new amended and restated credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing and future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the new amended and restated credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis until the termination of the new amended and restated credit facility 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the new amended and restated credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 325100 and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the new amended and restated credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 500100 

in addition our new amended and restated credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense 

furthermore we cannot assure you that we will maintain financing activities and cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 

increased costs of financing a reduction in the availability of financing and fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our liquidity operating expenses and results 

adverse conditions in the domestic and global financial markets may increase our costs of financing and adversely affect our ability to refinance debt maturities raise capital or fund other types of obligations any downgrades to our credit rating may likewise increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing 

further our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars libor tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market we are not required to enter into interest rate swaps to hedge our debt under the new amended and restated credit facility and while we may do so in the future we have not currently hedged our interest rate exposure and accordingly our interest expense for any particular period for unhedged debt may fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates to the extent these interest rates increase our interest 

  

expense will increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected see also the discussion of interest rate risk in part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

if we do enter into interest rate swap agreements developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivative instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivative instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our interest rate hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel if the equity incentive compensation plans that we currently have in place do not adequately compensate our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems the internet and our information technology platform and any failures disruptions or instability may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and its components including our data centers and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error natural disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time we have experienced and may experience again in the future denialofservice attacks while we have been able to defend our systems against such attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns occur with respect to our electronic delivery systems the internet or our information technology platform our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services may be materially and adversely affected for example during fiscal 2012 we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers as a result of this migration we experienced some unanticipated interruption and delay with respect to the performance and delivery of certain of our products while such issues have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or results of 

  

operations there is no assurance that they or future migrations will not have such effect in the future as a result of such issues we could be required to provide service credits and experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also incur increased operating expenses to protect ourselves from and defend against such disruptions and attacks which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

any perceived conflicts of interest resulting from providing products and services to institutional investors in addition to proxy voting recommendations or providing products and services to corporations which are the subject of our proxy recommendations or other products and services could harm our reputation and business 

institutional clients of our governance business rely on iss and certain of its affiliates to provide them with informed proxy vote recommendations benchmark proxy voting guidelines and unbiased analyses of companies’ environmental social and governance attributes the institutional clients of both our performance and risk and governance businesses particularly hedge funds and more active institutional investors may have material economic and other interests in the corporations on which the governance business provides proxy analyses and ratings in some cases these institutional clients may be the subject of the governance business’ proxy analyses and ratings or pay us a significant amount of money for our performance and risk products and services and accordingly there may be a perception that we might advocate a particular position or provide research that supports a particular conclusion with respect to an institutional client or corporation in order to satisfy the unique economic or other interests of a particular institutional client as a result institutional clients competitors and other market participants could raise questions about our ability to provide unbiased services which could harm our reputation 

through our iss corporate services subsidiary we provide products and services to corporate clients who use these services to learn about and improve their corporate governance practices accordingly there is potential for a perceived conflict of interest between the services we provide to institutional clients and the services including our compensation advisory services provided to clients of the iss corporate services subsidiary for example when we provide corporate governance services to a corporate client and at the same time provide proxy vote recommendations to institutional clients regarding that corporation’s proxy items there may be a perception that the governance business team providing research to our institutional clients may treat that corporation more favorably due to its use of services provided by iss corporate services we have implemented an information barrier and other procedures designed to prevent any potential conflict of interest from impacting the ability of our research team to provide unbiased analyses 

the conflict management safeguards that we have implemented may not be adequate to manage these perceived conflicts of interest and clients regulators or competitors may question the integrity of our services for example on june 5 2013 the capital markets and government sponsored enterprise subcommittee of the committee on financial services of the us house of representatives held a hearing entitled “examining the market power and impact of proxy advisory firms” additionally the sec hosted a roundtable discussion on december 5 2013 that examined the influence of proxy advisers potential conflicts of interest and the transparency and accuracy of their recommendations while no formal recommendations were made at this meeting the sec continues to consider whether proxy advisory firms should be regulated in the event that we fail to adequately manage perceived conflicts of interest we could incur reputational damage or become subject to additional regulation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where 

  

we or our clients are located and other events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events 

such events could also have a material adverse effect on our clients for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in connection with the acquisitions of riskmetrics and ipd we acquired new offices in 10 nonus locations since 2010 we have also opened offices in santiago seoul taipei and shanghai we intend to further grow our presence in mexico the middle east asia africa eastern europe and south america a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the united states and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

in order to penetrate markets outside of the united states we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market for example the continued success of ipd’s products is dependent on understanding local real estate markets and maintaining relationships with local real estate industry bodies in the jurisdictions in which ipd operates demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and corporate governance and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the united states there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

  

we may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities from time to time we also implement changes to our global corporate structure changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate such changes include but are not limited to proposed legislation to reform us taxation of international business activities 

although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

changes in the legislative regulatory and corporate environments in which iss’s clients operate may adversely impact our financial results 

iss’s historical growth has been due in part to increased regulatory requirements highly visible corporate scandals increased shareholder activism and corporate chief executive officers and boards of directors that are increasingly concerned about and responsive to shareholder concerns to the extent that any of these trends change the demand for iss’s products and services could be reduced and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation to the extent these regulations change or are not extended to other markets our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

  

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 23945 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2013 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired on october 31 2013 we announced that we had engaged morgan stanley to explore strategic alternatives for the governance business including the potential divestiture or other separation of the entire business there can be no assurance that the process of exploring these strategic alternatives will result in a transaction or that any transaction will ultimately be consummated in addition an adverse outcome from the pursuit of the strategic alternatives could lead to potential future impairment charges see note 9 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the new york stock exchange for example the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial conditions and the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities see “— changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

in connection with our ipo and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plans 

as of december 31 2013 118083111 shares of our common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of december 31 2013 we had issued 5666537 and 133309 shares of common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 4257779 shares of msci common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to officers and certain employees of riskmetrics pursuant to the riskmetrics group inc 2000 stock option plan riskmetrics group inc 2004 stock option plan institutional shareholder services holdings inc equity incentive 

  

plan and riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan collectively the “rmg plans” as of december 31 2013 we had issued 3323035 shares of common stock under the rmg plans in june 2010 we also filed a registration statement assuming 3060090 shares available under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan as of december 31 2013 we had issued 1754690 shares of common stock under this plan which terminated on june 30 2012 see note 11 “share based compensation — deferred stock awards and — stock option awards ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of the company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your common stock in an acquisition

assets mutual funds etfs real estate hedge funds and private wealth and financial intermediaries such as banks brokerdealers exchanges custodians and investment consultants to calculate the number of clients we may count certain affiliates and business units within a single organization as separate clients for example the asset management and brokerdealer units of a diversified financial services firm may be treated as separate clients even though the financial services firm is the only party to the applicable subscriptions or licenses 

our aggregate retention rates were 913 and 897 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively our core retention rates were 916 and 904 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively for a description of the calculation of our aggregate and core retention rates see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—key financial metrics and drivers— operating metrics—retention rates ”

sales and client support 

as of december 31 2013 our client coverage offices included nearly 235 sales people and over 250 client support people worldwide of these over 85 were located in our new york offices and over 65 were located in our london office in the last few years we have expanded our sales efforts to grow our revenues and our client 

  

service efforts to ensure client satisfaction and develop client loyalty in recent years for example we have opened new sales and client coverage offices in seoul korea and taipei taiwan and expanded our sales presence in china and the middle east in 2013 we also significantly increased the number of client coverage and sales people in canada the philippines and the us and in 2014 we have opened a sales office in santiago chile we have also created more specialized sales and client support teams to increase our impact in each client segment namely hedge funds asset owners financial advisors private wealth managers and broker dealers in the americas we also increased our focus on smaller asset managers and hedge funds financial advisors and insurance firms our sales and client support staff are based in 29 offices around the world enabling us to provide valuable facetoface client service and focus efforts on developing new clients in more locations 

the sophisticated nature of our products and their uses demand a sales and client support staff with strong academic and financial backgrounds most new sales require several facetoface meetings with the prospective client and the sales process for large and complex sales is likely to involve a team from sales client support product management and research for barra and riskmetrics branded products sales and client support personnel are available to onboard new clients and new users which includes providing intensive onsite training in the use of the models data and software applications underlying each product client support also provides ongoing support which may include onsite visits telephone and email support 24 hours five days a week and routine client support needed in connection with the use of the product or how it can help clients improve their process all of which are included in the recurring subscription fee we believe that the size quality knowledge and experience of our sales and client support staff as well as their proximity to clients differentiate us from our competitors

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer you should read the section titled “forwardlooking statements” beginning on page 1 for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index analytics and governance products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data 

  

throughout our businesses we utilize certain data provided by third party data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world as of december 31 2013 there were over 200 such data suppliers if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our data suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us for example iss relies on a data feed agreement with broadridge which allows for a large number of proxy ballots to be received and proxy votes to be processed electronically minimizing the manual aspects of the proxy voting process and limiting the risk of error inherent in manual processes if the data feed agreement with broadridge was terminated we would have to incur significant expenses in order to input our clients’ voting instructions directly into broadridge’s proprietary electronic voting systems and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers have sought and others may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the united states our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to decrease our fees correspondingly or otherwise lead to a reduction of our fees in certain cases see “— our revenues and earnings attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets or other factors that are tied to the calculation of our fees for certain indexlinked investment products ” below competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide exchange traded funds “etfs” among other products the fees etf providers charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers for example on october 15 2012 blackrock announced that its ishares etf business launched a new series of funds based on certain msci investable market indexes pursuant to a license with fee levels that are lower than those the company currently receives with respect to existing ishares etfs based on msci’s 

  

standard indexes additionally clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example on october 2 2012 we announced that vanguard had informed the company of its decision to no longer use msci’s indexes as the basis for certain of its index funds including both etf and other share classes beginning in 2013 representing a loss of run rate of 248 million at december 31 2012 the ability of our licensees to cease using our indexes is generally true not just with respect to an index’s use as the basis of an etf but also with respect to its use as the basis of other financial products including mutual funds and institutional funds finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients etfs and institutional funds based on the same indexes a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the same index as the basis of the other type of product 

our revenues and earnings attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets or other factors that are tied to the calculation of our fees for certain indexlinked investment products a decrease in our fees for these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

clients that use our indexes as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues in addition in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in a product provider’s total expense ratio “ter” in those cases a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for 144 and 148 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 411 and 433 of the revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example as of december 31 2013 the monthend value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indexes was 3329 billion which was 173 lower than the value of such assets as of december 31 2012 and 100 higher than the value of such assets at september 30 2013 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 235 and 250 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 88 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 870 and 817 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs based on msci indexes see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above 

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and 

  

regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties it is possible that laws or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license our products or could impose additional costs upon us some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 we may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world in addition we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 

 

  

   

on october 20 2011 the european commission issued its proposal for mifidmifir 2 com 2011 0652 and com 2011 0656 agreement in principle has been reached between the european commission parliament and council and we expect that the regulation when adopted and implemented will among other things mandate that where the value of a financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark will be required to ensure that clearing entities and trading venues will be entitled to licenses to the benchmark as well as to relevant price and data feeds and information regarding the composition methodology and pricing of the benchmark and that access to such information will have to be granted by the benchmark owner within three months of the request at a fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate unless there are objective reasons to charge otherwise we still await the final text as well as the results of esma’s issuance of further guidance on the relevant technical standards thus it is difficult to predict its full effect on our index business but complying with this regulation to the extent that it leads to a material change in our business practices or reduces our ability to offer indexes in the european union on terms of our choosing as it appears it will could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en which are updated from time to time by esma “guidelines” the guidelines limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis the guidelines became effective as of february 17 2013 with respect to newly launched ucits funds they became effective for all ucits funds on february 17 2014 we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines although the full effects of the guidelines will be largely unknown until we have more clarification from esma andor individual regulators complying with any related requirements could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations including a negative impact on our licensing of index data andor our indexes as the basis of etfs and ucits additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations 

on june 6 2013 esma published its final report setting out principles for benchmarksetting processes in the eu esma2013659 “esma principles” the esma principles are intended to provide a general framework covering all stages of the benchmark setting process including data submission administration calculation publication the use of benchmarks and the continuity of benchmarks the esma principles are nonbinding but esma intends them to help transition to a potential european union framework for benchmarks and esma will review the esma principles’ application 18 months after their initial publication we are assessing the impact that compliance with the esma principles could have on our equity and real estate index product lines but complying with esma principles to the extent that it leads to a material change in our business practices or our ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business materially diminishes our intellectual property rights materially impacts our contractual commitments to our data contributors or causes our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at reasonable cost or at all could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

on july 17 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” published its final report on principles for financial benchmarks “iosco principles” the iosco principles cover conflicts of interest benchmark quality and integrity methodology requirements procedures related to handling complaints documentation requirements and audit reviews the iosco principles require benchmark administrators to publicly disclose whether they comply with the iosco principles within 12 months of their initial publication iosco will review the extent to which the iosco principles have been implemented within 18 months of publication we are assessing the impact that compliance with the iosco principles could have on our equity and real estate index product lines but complying with iosco principles to the extent that it leads to a material change in our business practices or our 

  

ability to offer our indexes materially increases our cost of doing business materially diminishes our intellectual property rights materially impacts our contractual commitments to our data contributors or causes our data contributors to refuse to contribute data to us at reasonable cost or at all could have a material adverse effect on our equity and real estate index product lines 

 

  

 following a consultation conducted by the european securities and markets authority “esma” with respect to the proxy advisory industry in europe esma has decided to require the proxy advisory industry to develop its own code of conduct which will be implemented under a complyorexplain regime esma is recommending the development of a code of conduct that focuses on identifying disclosing and managing conflicts of interest and that fosters transparency esma will review the development of the code of conduct during 2016 and may reconsider its position if no substantial progress has been made by that time to address esma’s recommendations six proxy advisors are currently working on a set of best practice principles which are expected to be released in march 2014 on december 12 2012 the european commission also released an action plan that contemplated considering an initiative with a view to improving the transparency and conflicts of interest frameworks applicable to proxy advisors additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe such as canada have adopted and others could adopt similar concepts proposals or regulations 

at this point we are unable to determine whether the sec the european commission or other regulatory bodies will pursue rulemaking or legislation on these matters and if so the extent to which any rule or legislation might impact our businesses including the process by which we provide proxy research and voting services to clients the manner in which iss operates as a proxy advisory firm the business model that provides for both voting services to investor clients and governance advice to corporate clients or otherwise however as with any regulatory change or the introduction of new 

  

legislation we may have to change business practices and operational procedures and incur costs in response to possible modifications to the proxy system that could result from any rulemaking or legislation that stems from the sec’s concept release the adoption of the code of conduct encouraged by esma or action by the european commission or other regulatory bodies 

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth including in emerging market locations has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow organically or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting training and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers or key employees developing effective leadership in all of our locations expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth additionally new hires require significant training and may in some cases take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “— we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways” and “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise ” below part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and part i item 1 “business—company history” 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop internally certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example in august 2011 blackrock announced that it was seeking regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of etfs that it would manage see “— a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation could damage our reputation andor result in claims against us by our clients or regulators and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example on september 14 2012 we received a wells notice from the staff of the sec in connection with allegations that an iss employee provided confidential information about how clients voted their 

  

proxies to proxy solicitors in return for cash and other gifts the employee was subsequently terminated from his position and we cooperated with investigations of both the sec and the us department of justice in settling with the sec and without admitting or denying the sec’s allegations iss consented to the entry of an administrative order requiring that iss comply with relevant provisions of the securities laws pay a 300000 civil monetary penalty and retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of iss’s supervisory and compliance policies and procedures if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures results in a security or privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have confidentiality policies in place regarding changes to the composition of our indexes and have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indexes from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indexes can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indexes our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have confidentiality policies in place and have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our equity indexes if our confidentiality policies or information barrier procedures fail or we are delayed in implementing such procedures as necessary with respect to a newly acquired business and an employee inadvertently discloses or deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indexes our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our confidentiality policies or information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list etfs or other financial products based on our equity indexes only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our equity indexes if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our equity indexes which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition 

  

the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights such claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages or limit our future use of integral technologies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have increasingly pursued or may consider pursuing patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model software application or other relevant product or process we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time such complaints are filed by or we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to re 

  

engineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts our use of certain third party software and data has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased software or data acquisition costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industry in which we operate and the impact of technological change on our products we must continually introduce new products and services enhance 

  

including through integration existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services if among other things we fail to accurately anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely or if competitors in any business line introduce products services systems and processes that are better than ours or that gain greater market acceptance we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results for example we have made and need to continue to make investments in our technology platform in order to provide competitive products and services to our clients from time to time we also incur costs to integrate existing products and platforms and transition clients to enhanced products and services which also presents execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected also see “— if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product there may also be consolidation among our competitors in the form of joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for better capitalized competitors 

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many cases including for singlepurpose product companies the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or indexes profit margin considerations including those arising from financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients resulting from current economic conditions may lead certain clients to seek products at a lower cost than what we provide see “ — changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations — potential and proposed regulation affecting benchmarks ” above 

these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and product development resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “— our clients that pay us a fee based on assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indexes which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees ” above and part i item 1 “business—our competition” 

  

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring portfolios to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a portion of our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our equity indexes could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services during that annual period for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe the annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions can also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected see “ —changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations — potential and proposed regulation affecting benchmarks ” above 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development and marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “— to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions ” above and part i item 1 “business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if we are unable to manage our operating costs as anticipated or our operating costs are higher than expected our operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs software development costs professional fees costs related to information technology infrastructure and other costs if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by certain factors that are beyond our control including global financial market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation 

unfavorable changes in global financial market conditions may negatively impact the financial viability of our clients the majority of which are in the financial services industry resulting in reduced demand for our products and services due to the closure or consolidation of our clients the inability of our customers to pay for products or services prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable our cash flows may also be impacted by changes in interest rates currency exchange rates inflation and delayed payment or underpayment by our customers which could restrict our access to capital markets adverse changes in the financial markets could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

additionally as a result of the global financial crisis the us congress undertook major financial reform which led to the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank act the doddfrank act could have a significant impact on many aspects of the way in which the financial services industry conducts business and has and will continue to impose substantial new regulation on and regulatory oversight of a wide variety of financial services institutions although many of the effects of the doddfrank act will be largely unknown until all of the regulations have been finalized and implemented complying with its requirements could negatively impact the business operations and financial viability of many of our clients which in turn could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any acquisition could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see part i item 1 “business—company history” 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our indexlinked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the us where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in nonoperating “other expense income net” in our consolidated statement of income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 144 and 148 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 151 and 126 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2013 539 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 229 were in british pounds sterling and 130 were in japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2012 583 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 218 were in japanese yen and 121 were in british pounds sterling 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 428 and 345 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling euros swiss francs indian rupees hungarian forints hong kong dollars and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency a gain or loss results from the change in 

  

value of the functional currency we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with intercompany loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 24 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our performance and risk products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our governance products and services support the proxy voting processes of our clients our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or the failure to provide the services provided in client contracts however these provisions may not always eliminate liability entirely and may have certain exceptions that could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties and adverse monetary judgments or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

on may 4 2012 we amended and restated our credit facility which originally consisted of a senior secured term loan b facility and revolving credit facility entered into on june 1 2010 as amended by amendment no 1 dated as of february 4 2011 and amendment no 2 dated as of march 14 2011 the credit facility as so amended and restated the “amended and restated credit facility” the amended and restated credit facility provides for the incurrence of a new senior secured 5year term loan a facility in an aggregate amount of 8800 million “term loan” and a new 1000 million senior secured revolving facility “revolving credit facility” the proceeds of the amended and restated credit facility together with cash on hand were used to prepay the remaining outstanding principal of the existing term loan b facility on december 12 2013 we entered into amendment no 1 to the amended and restated credit facility the “new amended and restated credit facility” that among other things extended the maturity dates of the term loan and revolving credit facility to december 12 2018 and modified the amortization schedule see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for additional information regarding amendment no1 

as of december 31 2013 we had 8100 million of indebtedness under the new amended and restated credit facility as amended 203 million in current maturities and 7897 million in long term debt 3584 million of cash and cash equivalents and no shortterm investments 

the new amended and restated credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien 

  

and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future material domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our material domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the new amended and restated credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing and future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the new amended and restated credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis until the termination of the new amended and restated credit facility 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the new amended and restated credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 325100 and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the new amended and restated credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 500100 

in addition our new amended and restated credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense 

furthermore we cannot assure you that we will maintain financing activities and cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 

increased costs of financing a reduction in the availability of financing and fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our liquidity operating expenses and results 

adverse conditions in the domestic and global financial markets may increase our costs of financing and adversely affect our ability to refinance debt maturities raise capital or fund other types of obligations any downgrades to our credit rating may likewise increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing 

further our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars libor tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market we are not required to enter into interest rate swaps to hedge our debt under the new amended and restated credit facility and while we may do so in the future we have not currently hedged our interest rate exposure and accordingly our interest expense for any particular period for unhedged debt may fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates to the extent these interest rates increase our interest 

  

expense will increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected see also the discussion of interest rate risk in part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

if we do enter into interest rate swap agreements developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivative instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivative instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our interest rate hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee our management and employees may terminate their employment at any time and the loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel if the equity incentive compensation plans that we currently have in place do not adequately compensate our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems the internet and our information technology platform and any failures disruptions or instability may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology platform electronic delivery systems and its components including our data centers and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error natural disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time we have experienced and may experience again in the future denialofservice attacks while we have been able to defend our systems against such attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns occur with respect to our electronic delivery systems the internet or our information technology platform our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services may be materially and adversely affected for example during fiscal 2012 we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers as a result of this migration we experienced some unanticipated interruption and delay with respect to the performance and delivery of certain of our products while such issues have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or results of 

  

operations there is no assurance that they or future migrations will not have such effect in the future as a result of such issues we could be required to provide service credits and experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also incur increased operating expenses to protect ourselves from and defend against such disruptions and attacks which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

any perceived conflicts of interest resulting from providing products and services to institutional investors in addition to proxy voting recommendations or providing products and services to corporations which are the subject of our proxy recommendations or other products and services could harm our reputation and business 

institutional clients of our governance business rely on iss and certain of its affiliates to provide them with informed proxy vote recommendations benchmark proxy voting guidelines and unbiased analyses of companies’ environmental social and governance attributes the institutional clients of both our performance and risk and governance businesses particularly hedge funds and more active institutional investors may have material economic and other interests in the corporations on which the governance business provides proxy analyses and ratings in some cases these institutional clients may be the subject of the governance business’ proxy analyses and ratings or pay us a significant amount of money for our performance and risk products and services and accordingly there may be a perception that we might advocate a particular position or provide research that supports a particular conclusion with respect to an institutional client or corporation in order to satisfy the unique economic or other interests of a particular institutional client as a result institutional clients competitors and other market participants could raise questions about our ability to provide unbiased services which could harm our reputation 

through our iss corporate services subsidiary we provide products and services to corporate clients who use these services to learn about and improve their corporate governance practices accordingly there is potential for a perceived conflict of interest between the services we provide to institutional clients and the services including our compensation advisory services provided to clients of the iss corporate services subsidiary for example when we provide corporate governance services to a corporate client and at the same time provide proxy vote recommendations to institutional clients regarding that corporation’s proxy items there may be a perception that the governance business team providing research to our institutional clients may treat that corporation more favorably due to its use of services provided by iss corporate services we have implemented an information barrier and other procedures designed to prevent any potential conflict of interest from impacting the ability of our research team to provide unbiased analyses 

the conflict management safeguards that we have implemented may not be adequate to manage these perceived conflicts of interest and clients regulators or competitors may question the integrity of our services for example on june 5 2013 the capital markets and government sponsored enterprise subcommittee of the committee on financial services of the us house of representatives held a hearing entitled “examining the market power and impact of proxy advisory firms” additionally the sec hosted a roundtable discussion on december 5 2013 that examined the influence of proxy advisers potential conflicts of interest and the transparency and accuracy of their recommendations while no formal recommendations were made at this meeting the sec continues to consider whether proxy advisory firms should be regulated in the event that we fail to adequately manage perceived conflicts of interest we could incur reputational damage or become subject to additional regulation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where 

  

we or our clients are located and other events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events 

such events could also have a material adverse effect on our clients for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in connection with the acquisitions of riskmetrics and ipd we acquired new offices in 10 nonus locations since 2010 we have also opened offices in santiago seoul taipei and shanghai we intend to further grow our presence in mexico the middle east asia africa eastern europe and south america a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the united states and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

in order to penetrate markets outside of the united states we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market for example the continued success of ipd’s products is dependent on understanding local real estate markets and maintaining relationships with local real estate industry bodies in the jurisdictions in which ipd operates demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and corporate governance and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the united states there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

  

we may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anticorruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities from time to time we also implement changes to our global corporate structure changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate such changes include but are not limited to proposed legislation to reform us taxation of international business activities 

although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

changes in the legislative regulatory and corporate environments in which iss’s clients operate may adversely impact our financial results 

iss’s historical growth has been due in part to increased regulatory requirements highly visible corporate scandals increased shareholder activism and corporate chief executive officers and boards of directors that are increasingly concerned about and responsive to shareholder concerns to the extent that any of these trends change the demand for iss’s products and services could be reduced and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation to the extent these regulations change or are not extended to other markets our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

  

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 23945 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2013 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired on october 31 2013 we announced that we had engaged morgan stanley to explore strategic alternatives for the governance business including the potential divestiture or other separation of the entire business there can be no assurance that the process of exploring these strategic alternatives will result in a transaction or that any transaction will ultimately be consummated in addition an adverse outcome from the pursuit of the strategic alternatives could lead to potential future impairment charges see note 9 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the new york stock exchange for example the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial conditions and the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities see “— changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations ” above 

in connection with our ipo and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plans 

as of december 31 2013 118083111 shares of our common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of december 31 2013 we had issued 5666537 and 133309 shares of common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 4257779 shares of msci common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to officers and certain employees of riskmetrics pursuant to the riskmetrics group inc 2000 stock option plan riskmetrics group inc 2004 stock option plan institutional shareholder services holdings inc equity incentive 

  

plan and riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan collectively the “rmg plans” as of december 31 2013 we had issued 3323035 shares of common stock under the rmg plans in june 2010 we also filed a registration statement assuming 3060090 shares available under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan as of december 31 2013 we had issued 1754690 shares of common stock under this plan which terminated on june 30 2012 see note 11 “share based compensation — deferred stock awards and — stock option awards ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of the company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your common stock in an acquisition 

 

 nothing required to be disclosed 

  

 our corporate headquarters is located in new york new york this is also our largest sales office and one of our main research centers as of december 31 2013 our principal offices consisted of the following leased properties 

 

 as of december 31 2013 we also leased and occupied sales and client support offices in the following locations hong kong china chicago illinois tokyo japan frankfurt germany paris france san francisco california sydney australia ann arbor michigan toronto canada shanghai china singapore almere netherlands cape town south africa milan italy stockholm sweden sao paolo brazil seoul korea dubai united arab emirates and taipei taiwan 

the majority of our properties are used in support of both our performance and risk and our governance operating segments we believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations we also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space including those under lease options will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion 

 

 various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against the company in the ordinary course of business while the amounts claimed could be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that msci’s business operating results financial condition or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of matters that are currently pending or asserted will not individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on msci’s business operating results financial condition or cash flows

our principal sales model in both of our business segments is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for an annual fee paid upfront additionally our recurring subscriptions are increasingly related to our managed services offering whereby we oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients fees attributable to annual recurring subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered additionally a portion of our revenues come from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades we generate revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmarks reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our products offered by ipd group limited “ipd” that are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates we also receive revenues from onetime fees related to implementation historical or customized reports advisory and consulting services overages relating to proxy research and voting services licenses of historical data sales fees relating to recovery of securities class action settlements and from certain products and services that are designed for onetime usage 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue growth for the company in total and by product category as well as operating profit growth in addition we focus on operating metrics including run rates and retention rates to manage the business our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our operating profits into excess cash in the future our revenue growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing product offerings including combining existing product features or data derived from our products to create new products and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we expect to continue to invest in and expand our operating functions and infrastructure including additional product management sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world and additional staff and supporting technology for our 

  

research and our data operations and technology functions at the same time managing and controlling our operating expenses is very important to us and a distinct part of our culture 

the goal of these investments is to maximize our mediumterm revenue and operating income growth while at the same time ensuring that msci will remain a leading provider of investment decision support tools well into the future as a result the rate of growth of our investments may from time to time exceed that of our revenues which would slow the growth of or even reduce our operating profit for example for the year ended december 31 2013 our revenues grew by 90 but our operating income only grew by 71 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 due in part to increased investment in the business we anticipate that our increases in spending in areas such as sales client service information technology and product development in the year ending december 31 2014 will continue to exceed the rate of growth of our revenues and will again slow the growth of our operating profit however we believe these investments will result in higher revenue and operating profit growth over the mediumterm

key financial metrics and drivers 

revenues 

our revenues are grouped into the following five product andor service categories 

index and esg 

this category includes subscription fees from msci equity index data and ipd and esg research and analytics products fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indexes fees from nonrecurring licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from real estate and custom indexes we also generate a limited amount of revenues based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes 

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indexes also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client clients who utilize our esg research and analytics products and services pay an annual subscription fee and access these products and services via a webbased application data feed or thirdparty vendor 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes investment inflows and outflows and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee which in some cases may be based on a product provider’s total expense ratio times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period 

risk management analytics products 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to our risk management analytics products including our two major products riskmanager and barraone we have increasing recurring subscriptions to our managed services offering in which our staff oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients other products in this category include hedgeplatform intersight datametrics wealthbench credit manager and investorforce the products offer a consistent risk assessment framework for managing and monitoring investments in a variety of asset classes across an organization we are able to grow our revenues by licensing additional users and locations as well as selling additional products and services

see part i item 1 “business—business segments products and services” for additional details regarding the products and services that we offer 

operating metrics 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of our total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as our “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscriptions and investment product licenses we currently provide to our clients under renewable contracts or agreements assuming all contracts or agreements that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent currency exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects for etf fees the market value on the last trading day of the period and for nonetf funds and futures and options the most recent periodic fee earned under such license or subscription the december 31 2012 run rate for ipd products was approximated using the trailing 12 months of revenues primarily adjusted for estimates for nonrecurring sales new sales and cancellations the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future revenues there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the following table sets forth our run rates and the percentage growth over the periods indicated 

 

 december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 

total run rate grew by 830 million to 10504 million as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 total subscription run rate grew by 517 million to 8921 million as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 excluding the impact of the acquisition of investor force holdings inc “investorforce” as well as the disposition of the cfra product line total subscription run rate grew by 504 million as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 

subscription run rate from the index and esg products grew by 335 million to 3715 million at december 31 2013 relative to december 31 2012 driven by growth in equity index benchmark and data products 

on october 2 2012 the vanguard group inc announced its decision to change the target benchmarks of 22 of its etfs from msci’s equity indexes the “vanguard etfs” as a result of this announcement we excluded the 1385 billion of assets in the 22 vanguard etfs linked to msci equity indexes as of december 31 2012 for purposes of calculating the index and esg assetbased fee run rate which resulted in a decrease of 248 million the average value of assets in the 22 vanguard etfs linked to msci equity indexes was 1221 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the total average value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indexes of 3491 billion 

assetbased fee run rate from index and esg products increased by 312 million to 1583 million at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 the increase was primarily driven by inflows into and higher market performance by etfs linked to msci indexes the assetbased fee run rate at december 31 2012 excludes the vanguard etfs that later switched benchmarks 

as of december 31 2013 assets under management “aum” in etfs linked to msci indexes were 3329 billion down 694 billion or 173 compared to december 31 2012 during the year ended december 31 2013 mscilinked etfs were impacted by market increases of 339 billion and net outflows of 1033 billion if the aum related to those vanguard etfs which transitioned earlier in 2013 were excluded from the december 31 2012 balance aum in etfs linked to msci indexes would have risen 691 billion or 262 compared to december 31 2012 

  

risk management analytics products run rate increased 285 million to 2907 million at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 excluding the impact attributable to investorforce run rate grew by 182 million run rate continued to benefit from solid growth in the riskmanager and barraone products changes in foreign currency positively benefited run rate by 12 million compared to december 31 2012 

portfolio management analytics products run rate declined 67 million to 1031 million at december 31 2013 from december 31 2012 yearoveryear run rate was negatively impacted in part by product swaps totaling 11 million and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which lowered run rate by an additional 24 million 

energy and commodity analytics products run rate declined to 113 million at december 31 2013 down 18 million from december 31 2012 

governance products run rate declined by 18 million to 1155 million at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 excluding the impact of the sale of the cfra product line from december 31 2012 run rate grew by 72 million reflecting strong growth in the run rate of executive compensation data and analytics products and services 

december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 

total run rate grew by 854 million to 9674 million as of december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 the december 31 2012 run rate includes 395 million that was associated with the ipd acquisition the run rate for ipd was approximated using the trailing 12 months of revenues primarily adjusted for estimates for nonrecurring sales new sales and cancellations excluding the impact of the acquisition of ipd total run rate grew by 459 million total subscription run rate grew by 781 million to 8403 million as of december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 changes in foreign currency rates reduced run rate by 09 million as of december 31 2012 relative to december 31 2011 

subscription run rate from the index and esg products grew by 682 million to 3380 million at december 31 2012 relative to december 31 2011 excluding the impact of subscription run rate attributable to ipd products the subscription run rate from index and esg products grew by 287 million driven by growth in equity index benchmark products and esg products 

assetbased fee run rate from index and esg products increased by 74 million to 1271 million at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 the increase was primarily driven by higher overall levels of aum in etfs linked to msci indexes partially offset by the loss of the vanguard etfs excluding the impact of the vanguard etfs at december 31 2011 assetbased fee run rate would have grown by 254 million or 250 

as of december 31 2012 aum in etfs linked to msci indexes were 4023 billion up 1007 billion or 334 compared to december 31 2011 during the year ended december 31 2012 mscilinked etfs were impacted by market increases of 441 billion and net inflows of 566 billion excluding the vanguard etfs aum in mscilinked etfs would have been 2638 billion up 617 billion or 306 compared to december 31 2011 

risk management analytics products run rate increased 111 million to 2621 million at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 run rate continued to benefit from solid growth in the hedgeplatform and barraone products changes in foreign currency positively benefited run rate by 04 million compared to december 31 2011 

portfolio management analytics products run rate declined 85 million to 1098 million at december 31 2012 from december 31 2011 yearoveryear run rate was negatively impacted in part by product swaps totaling 30 million and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which lowered run rate by an additional 19 million 

  

energy and commodity analytics products run rate declined to 131 million at december 31 2012 down 18 million from december 31 2011 

governance products run rate increased 90 million to 1173 million at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 reflecting strong growth in the sales of our compensation data and analytics products as well as gains in our institutional proxy research and voting products 

changes in run rate between periods may be attributable to among other things increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indexes the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes price changes fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions 

net new recurring subscription sales 

the following table sets forth our net new recurring subscription sales 

 

 retention rates 

other key metrics are our “aggregate retention rate” and “core retention rate” which are collectively referred to as “retention rates” these metrics are important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our core retention rate is calculated in the same way as our aggregate retention rate except that the core retention rate does not treat switches between products as a cancellation our aggregate and core retention rates are computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate or core retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indexes or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes aggregate and core retention rates for a nonannual period reflect the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

  

the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

 the following table sets forth our core retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

   

the quarterly retention rates are calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the quarter and we have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded cancellations of 238 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 238 million to derive 950 million of annualized cancellations this 950 million was then divided by the 8403 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 113 the 113 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 887 for the fourth quarter 

for the calculation of the core retention rate the same methodology was used except the amount of cancellations in the quarter was reduced by the amount of product swaps for example in fourth quarter 2013 we had product swaps of 06 million which was subtracted from the 238 million of actual cancels to derive core cancels of 231 million this 231 million was annualized to derive 926 million of annualized cancellations which was then divided by the 8403 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 110 the 110 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive the core retention rate of 890 for the fourth quarter 

for the year ended december 31 2013 325 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter historically retention rates have generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 

expenses 

we group our operating expenses into five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data operations and technology software engineering product management and proxy research and voting functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits occupancy market data fees proxy voting fees information technology and other miscellaneous costs the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

selling general and administrative 

this category includes compensation and benefits costs for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses were for occupancy thirdparty consulting costs and information technology 

  

restructuring 

during the year ended november 30 2010 msci’s management approved committed to and initiated a plan to restructure the company’s operations due to its acquisition of riskmetrics group llc formerly riskmetrics group inc “riskmetrics” the plan was substantially completed by december 31 2011 restructuring included expenses associated with the elimination of overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs the termination of overlapping vendor contracts and the discontinuance of the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangibles expense relates to the definitelived intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of barra llc formerly barra inc “barra” in june 2004 riskmetrics in june 2010 measurisk llc “measurisk” in july 2010 ipd in november 2012 and investorforce in january 2013 as well as capitalized software development costs our intangible assets consist of customer relationships trademarks and trade names technology and software proprietary processes and data and noncompetition agreements we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented we have no indefinitelived intangibles the intangible assets have remaining useful lives ranging from one to 20 years 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets 

other expense income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our credit facilities interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments foreign currency gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition sharebased compensation research and development income taxes deferred revenue goodwill intangible assets allowance for doubtful accounts and accrued compensation if different assumptions or conditions were to be utilized the results could be materially different from our reported results 

  

revenue recognition 

in general we apply sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” “ revenue recognition ” in determining revenue recognition accordingly we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

 when a sales arrangement requires the delivery of more than one product and service revenue is recognized pursuant to the requirements of financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 60525 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” under the provisions of asc subtopic 60525 elements within a multideliverable arrangement should be considered separate units of accounting if all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

 we provide products and services to our clients under various software and nonsoftware related arrangements we have signed contracts with substantially all clients that set forth the fees to be paid for our products and services further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client for collectability our application service license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions which generally allow a client to test the solution for a defined period of time before committing to the license if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision we do not recognize subscription revenues until the earlier of the receipt of a written client acceptance or if not notified by the client that it is cancelling the license agreement the expiration of the acceptance period 

our subscription agreements for nonsoftwarerelated application services include provisions that among other things allow clients for no additional fee to receive updates and modifications that may be made from time to time when and if available for the term of the agreement which is typically one year these arrangements do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the application at any time for sales arrangements with multiple deliverables which may include application service subscription and professional services associated with implementation and other services we evaluate each deliverable in these multipleelement arrangements to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting and allocate revenue accordingly 

in most cases we recognize revenues from subscription arrangements ratably over the term of the license agreement pursuant to contract terms the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated the fees are recognized as we supply the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date when implementation services are included we recognize revenues allocated to the subscription ratably from the date the application is put into production to the end of the license period revenues associated with the implementation services are recognized ratably over the period the client is expected to benefit from those services for products and services whose fees are based on estimated aum linked to our indexes or contract values related to futures and options we recognize revenues based on estimates from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information from the client revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmarks reports digests and other publications which are most often associated with our ipd products are recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates 

  

our softwarerelated arrangements do not require significant modification or customization of any underlying software applications being licensed accordingly we recognize software revenues pursuant to the requirements of asc subtopic 985605 “ softwarerevenue recognition ” our subscription agreements for software products include provisions that among other things would allow clients to receive unspecified when and if available future software upgrades for no additional fee as well as the right to use the software products with maintenance and technical support for the term of the agreement which is typically one year software agreements may include other consulting and professional services in accordance with asc subtopic 985605 we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for these elements and therefore recognize software related revenue upon delivery then ratably over the term of the license agreement 

sharebased compensation 

certain of our employees have received sharebased compensation under certain compensation programs our compensation expense reflects the fair value method of accounting for sharebased payments under asc subtopic 71810 “ compensationstock compensation ” asc subtopic 71810 requires measurement of compensation cost for equitybased awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period net of estimated forfeitures 

the fair value of msci restricted stock units “rsus” is measured as the closing price of msci’s common stock on the day prior to grant restricted stock units subject to performance conditions “psus” are based on performance measures that impact the amount of shares that each recipient will receive upon vesting psus are granted at fair market value which is measured as the closing price of msci’s common stock on the day prior to grant 

the fair value of msci standard stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model and the single grant life method under the single grant life method option awards with graded vesting are valued using a single weightedaverage expected option life the fair value of msci stock options that contain stock price contingencies is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which creates a normal distribution of future stock prices which is then used to value the awards based on their individual terms 

based on interpretive guidance related to stock compensation the company’s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of sharebased awards that were granted to retirementeligible employees over the course of the prior year in which they were earned rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant a portion of the restricted stock units granted to employees are subject to certain performance conditions the company bases initial accruals of compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered if the estimated number of instruments changes from previous estimates the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change is recognized in compensation cost in the period of the change 

research and development costs 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with asc subtopic 73010 “ research and development ” asc subtopic 73010 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred the majority of our research and development costs are incurred in developing reviewing and enhancing the methodologies and data models offered within our product portfolio research and development costs included in the consolidated statements of income were 936 million 955 million and 903 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we apply the provisions of asc subtopic 35040 “ internal use software ” and account for the cost of computer software by capitalizing qualifying costs which are incurred during the application development stage the amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing software and the payroll and payrollrelated costs of employees directly associated with the development activities additionally costs incurred relating to upgrades and enhancements to the software are capitalized if it is determined that these

income taxes 

income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates 

we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we are required to file income tax returns we recorded additional tax expense related to open tax years which we believe is adequate in relation to the potential for assessments these amounts have been recorded in “other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated statement of financial condition we believe the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition however to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves a resolution could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

deferred revenue 

deferred revenues represent amounts billed to customers for products and services in advance of delivery our clients generally pay subscription fees annually or quarterly in advance deferred revenue is generally amortized over the service period as revenue recognition criteria are met where the service period has not begun and the client has not paid or the contract has not been renewed deferred revenues and accounts receivable are not recognized 

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded as part of our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired our goodwill relates to the acquisitions of barra riskmetrics measurisk ipd and investorforce our goodwill is not amortized but rather is subject to an impairment test each year or more often if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred pursuant to asc topic 350 “ intangibles—goodwill and other ” 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on july 1 and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist the testing for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level which is deemed to be at the level of the msci operating segments goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value if the estimated fair value exceeds the book value goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired if the estimated fair value is below book value however further analysis is required to determine the amount of impairment additionally if the book value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired further analysis is required as the estimated fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective book value on the testing dates no impairment of goodwill was recorded during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

revenues related to portfolio management analytics products decreased 92 to 1055 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 1161 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease in revenues was the result of lower sales and elevated cancellations of equity analytics products in prior periods 

revenues from energy and commodity analytics products increased 33 million or 366 to 124 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 91 million for the year ended december 31 2012 excluding the impact of the 52 million revenue adjustment recorded during the year ended december 31 2012 revenues from our energy and commodity analytics products would have decreased 19 million compared to the year ended december 31 2012

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 610 million or 101 to 6642 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 6032 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the 610 million increase primarily reflects higher compensation costs 

the following table shows operating expenses by each of the categories 

 

   

compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and have typically represented approximately 60 of our total operating expenses these costs generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting increased compensation and benefits expenses for current staff and increased staffing levels as of december 31 2013 the number of employees increased by 502 to 3261 from 2759 on december 31 2012 reflecting the addition of investorforce and increased staffing levels partially offset by the sale of the cfra product line continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefit expenses approximately 466 and 406 of our employees were located in emerging market centers as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

compensation and benefits costs for the year ended december 31 2013 were 4197 million an increase of 465 million or 125 compared to 3732 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in compensation and benefits costs primarily reflects 517 million of increased costs related to current staff and increased staffing levels partially offset by 41 million of lower severance costs 09 million of lower postretirement and other expenses and 02 million of lower stockbased compensation expenses 

noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 1640 million an increase of 159 million or 108 compared to 1481 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increased costs associated with the ipd and investorforce acquisitions in addition to increased travel marketing costs and expenses as a result of the previously announced decision to explore strategic alternatives for our governance segment were partially offset by lower transactionrelated expenses information technology other taxes and occupancy costs the impact of the 38 million lease exit charge associated with vacating our 88 pine street office space in new york the “lease exit charge” recognized in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to a corresponding benefit of 04 million recognized in the year ended december 31 2013 also decreased noncompensation expenses year over year

within cost of services noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 125 million or 174 to 846 million compared to 721 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was primarily driven by the acquisitions of ipd and investorforce partially offset by the impact of the lease exit charge recognized in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to a corresponding benefit recognized in the year ended december 31 2013

within sga noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 34 million or 45 to 794 million compared to 760 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was primarily the result of increased costs associated with the ipd and investorforce acquisitions along with expenses as a result of the previously announced decision to explore strategic alternatives for our governance segment this more than offset the lower transactionrelated expenses the impact of the lease exit charge recognized in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to a corresponding benefit recognized in the year ended december 31 2013 other taxes and information technology costs 

within sga selling expenses increased 112 to 1062 million and general and administrative expenses increased 83 to 1491 million for the year ended december 31 2013 

amortization of intangibles 

for the year ended december 31 2013 amortization of intangibles expense totaled 582 million compared to 633 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease primarily resulted from a portion of the intangible assets becoming fully amortized since the prior period partially offset by the increased amortization of intangible assets resulting from the ipd and investorforce acquisitions 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements totaled 223 million and 187 million respectively the increase was related to the impact of increased depreciation from the ipd and investorforce acquisitions as well as the depreciation of hardware and software assets acquired to build out data centers in the second half of the year ended december 31 2012 

other expense income net 

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2013 was 259 million a decrease of 316 million or 550 compared to 575 million for the year ended december 31 2012 for the year ended december 31 2012 206 million of expense was recognized related to the accelerated amortization of existing fees and the immediate recognition of new fees associated with our may 2012 debt refinancing compared to 14 million of expense recognized in the year ended december 31 2013 associated with our december 2013 debt extension the remaining difference was primarily the result of the impact on interest expense of lower average outstanding principal on our debt and lower associated interest rates 

income taxes 

the provision for income tax expense was 1231 million and 1052 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively these amounts reflect effective tax rates of 356 and 363 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the effective tax rate of 356 for the year ended december 31 2013 reflects our operating tax rate adjusted for the impact of certain discrete items the effect of which was to decrease our operating tax rate by 12 percentage points included in the discrete items was the benefit associated with the 2012 federal research and development credit which was reinstated into law as of january 2 2013 which decreased our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 by 04 percentage points 

the effective tax rate of 356 for the year ended december 31 2013 was lower than the prior year primarily because of the inclusion of the benefits associated with the federal research and development credit in our provision for income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2013

sga expense for the performance and risk business increased 207 million or 104 to 2200 million for the year ended december 31 2013 within sga compensation and benefits expenses increased 186 million to 1530 million primarily as a result of higher costs related to current staff and increased staffing levels partially related to the ipd and investorforce acquisitions partly offset by lower severance costs noncompensation expenses increased 21 million to 669 million the increased costs associated with the acquisitions more than offset the lower expenses recognized for transaction related and nonrecurring costs the impact of the lease exit charge recognized in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to a corresponding benefit recognized in the year ended december 31 2013 information technology costs and other taxes 

  

amortization of intangibles expense for the performance and risk business totaled 448 million and 500 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease primarily resulted from a portion of intangible assets becoming fully amortized since the prior period partially offset by the increased amortization associated with the intangible assets arising from the ipd and investorforce acquisitions

included in compensation and benefits costs stock based compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 247 million a decrease of 200 compared to 309 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease was primarily caused by lower expense associated with the amortization of restricted stock units and options awarded to certain of our employees in connection with our initial public offering in november 2007 the “founders grant award” and a decrease associated with the equity award granted in june 2010 to certain employees in connection with the riskmetrics acquisition the “performance award” the decrease in the expense related to the founders grant award is attributable to the award’s final vesting that occurred in november 2011 approximately 30 million of the stock based compensation expense was related to the founders grant award for the year ended december 31 2011 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 18 million and 49 million respectively of the stockbased compensation expense was associated with the performance award 

noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 were 1481 million an increase of 28 compared to 1440 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was driven primarily by the impact of recording the lease exit charge

no shortterm investments were held as of december 31 2013 shortterm investments were 709 million as of december 31 2012 all of the shortterm investments were held by us corporations and were not subject to repatriation considerations at december 31 2012 

we believe that domestic cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect existing foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 3204 million and 3471 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects a change in the timing of collections of our accounts receivable relative to the prior year partially offset by higher net income adjusted for certain noncash items 

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs market data costs interest expenses and income taxes the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is historically at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash provided by investing activities was 41 million and cash used in investing activities was 944 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the 985 million yearoveryear increase in cash provided by investing activities primarily reflects a decrease in net cash outflows resulting from acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 in the year ended december 31 2013 we began investing excess cash in money market funds and other similar cash equivalents rather than us treasury securities and other shortterm investments as we had in prior periods 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 1458 million and 3230 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects lower repayments on our debt partially offset by higher purchases of treasury shares 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and obligations arising from borrowings under the new amended and restated credit facility as amended the following summarizes our contractual obligations 

 

  

 the obligations related to msci’s uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainties surrounding the timing and final values of the settlement if any 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201302 “ reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income ” or asu 201302 the amendments in this update require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the income statement or in the notes thereto significant amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective net income line item this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2012 the adoption of asu 201302 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201310 “inclusion of the fed funds effective swap rate or overnight index swap rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes” or asu 201310 the amendments in this update permit the fed funds effective swap rate ois to be used as a us benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under asc topic 815 “derivatives and hedging” in addition to the interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the us government and libor the amendments also remove the restriction on using different benchmark rates for similar hedges this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after july 17 2013 the adoption of asu 201310 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” or asu 201311 the amendments in this update require that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except under a few limited circumstances the amendments in this update do not require new recurring disclosures this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 the adoption of asu 201311 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

 foreign currency risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction 

  

gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in nonoperating “other expense income net” in our consolidated statement of income 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our indexlinked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues from indexlinked investment products represented 144 and 148 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 151 and 126 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2013 539 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 229 were in british pounds sterling and 130 were in japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2012 583 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 218 were in japanese yen and 121 were in british pounds sterling 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 428 and 345 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling euros swiss francs indian rupees hungarian forints hong kong dollars and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency a gain or loss results from the change in value of the functional currency we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with intercompany loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 24 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and foreign currency exchange gains of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 3584 million and 1833 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively these amounts were held primarily in checking and money market accounts in the countries where we maintain banking relationships the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes at december 2012 we had invested 709 million in debt securities with maturity dates ranging from 91 to 360 days from the date of purchase we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates related to these positions declines in interest rates however will reduce future interest income 

borrowings under the 2012 term loan bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of libor and a margin of 200 which margin will be subject to adjustment based on our leverage ratio as of december 31 2013 the 2012 term loan as amended bore interest at 217 assuming an average of 8024 million of variable rate debt outstanding a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in libor for a one year period would result in 80 million of additional interest rate expense

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer you should read the section titled “forwardlooking statements” beginning on page 1 for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index and analytics products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data throughout our businesses we utilize certain data provided by third party data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world as of december 31 2012 there were over 200 such data suppliers if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our data suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us for example iss relies on a data feed agreement with broadridge financial solutions which allows for a large number of proxy ballots to be received and proxy votes to be processed electronically minimizing the manual aspects of the proxy voting process and limiting the risk of error inherent in manual processes if the data feed agreement with broadridge was terminated we would have to incur significant expenses in order to input our clients’ voting instructions directly into broadridge’s proprietary electronic voting systems and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers have sought and others may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

  

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients including blackrock and in our largest market the united states our clients including our largest clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to decrease our fees correspondingly or otherwise lead to a reduction of our fees in certain cases see “—our revenues and earnings attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets or other factors that are tied to the calculation of our fees for certain indexlinked investment products” below competition is intense and increasing rapidly among our clients that provide exchange traded funds among other products the fees etf providers charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers for example on october 15 2012 blackrock announced that its ishares etf business launched a new series of funds based on certain msci investable market indices pursuant to a license with fee levels that are lower than those the company currently receives with respect to existing ishares etfs based on msci’s standard indices additionally clients that have licensed our indices to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indices and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example on october 2 2012 we announced that vanguard had informed the company of its decision to no longer use msci’s indices as the basis for certain of its index funds including both etf and other share classes beginning in 2013 representing a loss of run rate of approximately 248 million at december 31 2012 the ability of our licensees to cease using our indices is generally true not just with respect to an index’s use as the basis of an etf but also with respect to its use as the basis of other financial products including mutual funds and institutional funds finally to the extent that an asset manager finds it beneficial to offer clients etfs and institutional funds based on the same indices a shift away from use of an index as the basis of one type of product may lead to a corresponding shift away from the same index as the basis of the other type of product 

our revenues and earnings attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets or other factors that are tied to the calculation of our fees for certain indexlinked investment products a decrease in our fees for these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets the value of an investment product’s assets can increase or decrease along with market performance and inflows and outflows which could impact our revenues in addition in many cases our fees can be affected by an increase or decrease in a product provider’s total expense ratio “ter” in those cases a reduction in the ter may negatively impact our revenues assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for approximately 148 and 156 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 433 and 447 of the revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively volatile capital markets such as those experienced recently as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example as of december 31 2012 the monthend value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 4023 billion which was 334 higher than the value of such assets as of december 31 2011 and 106 higher than the value of such assets at september 30 2012 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 250 and 258 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock accounted for 76 our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 817 and 839 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s exchange traded funds based on msci indices see “—our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees” above 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our clients may develop internally certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example in august 2011 blackrock announced that it was seeking regulatory clearance to create indices for use as the basis of exchange traded funds that it would manage see “—a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media such as the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls policies or procedures or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls policies or procedures then unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation could damage our reputation andor result in claims against us by our clients or regulators and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example on september 14 2012 we received a wells notice from the staff of the sec in connection with allegations that an iss employee provided confidential information about how clients voted their proxies to proxy solicitors in return for cash and other gifts if a failure of our internal controls policies or procedures results in a security or privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indices from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indices can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indices our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail and we inadvertently disclose or an individual deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indices our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permitted our clients to list exchange traded funds or other financial products based on our indices only if we provided a representation to the exchange that we had reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our indices if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our indices which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost 

  

time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights such claims would likely be costly to defend could require us to pay damages or limit our future use of integral technologies which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have in recent years increasingly pursued patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model or software application we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time such complaints are filed by or we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow we have made are making and expect to continue making expenditures related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure we monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to reengineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts our use of certain third party software and data has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased software or data acquisition 

  

costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions failure to do so could limit our ability to maintain or grow current revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industry in which we operate and the impact of technological change on our products we must continually introduce new products and services enhance including through integration existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services this requires accurate anticipation of clients’ changing needs and emerging investment trends we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate the revenues required to provide the desired results 

if among other things we fail to accurately anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated or if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely we could lose market share and clients to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations also see “—if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

integrating existing products and platforms and transitioning clients to enhanced products and services presents execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product there may also be consolidation among our competitors in the form of joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for better capitalized competitors 

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many cases including for singlepurpose product companies the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers 

  

to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or equity indices profit margin considerations including those arising from financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients resulting from current economic conditions may lead certain clients to seek products at a lower cost than what we provide 

these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “—our clients that pay us a fee based on assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees” below see “part i—item 1 business—our competition” above 

our business is dependent on the financial viability of our clients if our clients consolidate or are negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets and are forced to shutdown consolidate limit or reduce spending our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

most of our clients are in the financial services industry for example asset managers accounted for 607 and 605 of our revenues as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively ongoing economic weakness and volatility led to the closure or consolidation of a number of our clients including asset manager brokerdealer and hedge fund clients this impacted our financial results including our run rates and aggregate and core retention rates in 2012 and 2011 ongoing economic weakness and volatility continues to cause uncertainty and pressure on our clients’ spending resulting in longer selling and renewing cycles increased sales expenses and potentially increased cancellations 

if such trends continue we may not be able to generate or accurately plan for future growth and demand for our products may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of the global financial crisis the us congress undertook major financial reform which led to the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank act the doddfrank act will have a significant impact on many aspects of the way in which the financial services industry conducts business and will impose substantial new regulation on and regulatory oversight of a wide variety of financial services institutions although many of the effects of the doddfrank act will be largely unknown until the regulations have been finalized and implemented complying with its requirements could negatively impact the business operations and financial viability of many of our clients which in turn could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

if our clients consolidate or do not remain financially viable or if the negative conditions in the financial markets persist or worsen we may be forced to increase our provisions for bad debts which could adversely affect our profitability 

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring portfolios to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a portion of our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our indices could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services during that annual period for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while 

  

we believe the annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “—to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to manage our operating costs as anticipated or our operating costs are higher than expected our operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs additionally we may not fully realize our strategic initiatives to manage our cost structure if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by global factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates inflation and ratings downgrades 

nearterm predictions for the growth of the global economy remain weak concerns over the european debt crisis the potential collapse of the euro ratings downgrades the ability of the us government to manage the us deficit and prolonged high unemployment have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and markets going forward while we do not concentrate a significant amount of business in any one eurozone country we did derive 316 of our 2012 revenue from europe the general financial instability in any eurozone country could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the european union unfavorable changes in global economic conditions may negatively impact the demand for our products and services and may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services or cause them to go out of business entirely resulting in increased reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable cash flows may also be impacted resulting in restricted access to capital markets changes in currency exchange rates and delayed or underpayment by our customers adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth including in emerging market centers has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance 

  

that if we continue to grow internally or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting training and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” 

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any acquisition could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see item 1 business—company history and acquisitions 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating expense income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 148 and 156 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies 

  

against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 126 and 134 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2012 583 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 218 were in japanese yen and 121 were in british pounds sterling for the year ended december 31 2011 606 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 219 were in japanese yen and 99 were in british pounds sterling 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 345 and 341 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling swiss francs euros hong kong dollars hungarian forints indian rupees and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency a gain or loss results from the change in value of the functional currency we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with intercompany loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 26 million and foreign currency exchange gains of 11 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively although we believe that our guidelines and policies are reasonable and prudent any hedging instruments that we may enter into in the future may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 we may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world in addition we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 

  

  

  

  

 at this point we are unable to determine whether the sec or the european commission will pursue rulemaking or legislation on these matters and if so the extent to which any rule or legislation might impact our businesses including the process by which we provide proxy research and voting services to clients the manner in which iss operates as a proxy advisory firm the business model that provides for both voting services to investor clients and governance advice to corporate clients or otherwise however as with any regulatory change or the introduction of new legislation we may have to change business practices and operational procedures and incur costs in response to possible modifications to the proxy system that could result from any rulemaking or legislation that stems from the sec’s concept release the adoption of the code of conduct encouraged by esma or action by the european commission 

 

   

 on december 18 2012 esma published guidelines on etfs and other undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” issues esma2012832en these guidelines limit the types of indices that can be used as the basis of ucits funds and would require among other things index constituents together with their respective weightings to be made easily accessible free of charge such as via the internet to investors and prospective investors on a delayed basis the guidelines became effective as of february 17 2013 with respect to newly launched ucits funds they become effective for all ucits funds by february 17 2014 we have made available a client communication with respect to our policies as they relate to the guidelines although the full effects of the guidelines will be largely unknown until we have more clarification from esma andor individual regulators complying with any related requirements could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations including a negative impact on our licensing of index data andor our indices as the basis of etfs and ucits see—“legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights” above additionally other jurisdictions outside of europe could adopt similar concepts or regulations 

on september 5 2012 the european commission published a consultation paper on the potential regulation of indices including regulation regarding how benchmarks are calculated the governance and transparency of benchmarks the use of benchmarks the public provision of benchmarks and transition issues on february 8 2013 the european commission published the summary of results of the consultation paper although the effects of any such legislation will be largely unknown unless and until the european commission adopts any such legislation in response to this consultation paper complying with such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

on january 11 2013 esma issued a consultation paper on principles for benchmarkssetting processes in the eu esma201312 and on january 14 2013 the international organization of securities commissions issued a financial benchmarks consultation report msci has responded to both consultations and will await the results of those consultations the effects of these consultations are unknown but complying with any principles or guidelines resulting from these consultations that lead to a material change in on our business practices or diminish intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our index business 

we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our performance and risk products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our governance products and services support the proxy voting processes of clients our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products or the failure to provide the services provided in client contracts however these provisions have certain exceptions and could result in the provision of credits contractual penalties or be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

on may 4 2012 we amended and restated our existing senior secured credit facilities consisting of a senior secured term loan b facility and revolving credit facility which were originally entered into on june 1 2010 as amended by amendment no 1 dated as of february 4 2011 and amendment no 2 dated as of march 14 2011 the credit facility as so amended and restated the “amended and restated credit facility” the amended and restated credit facility provides for the incurrence of a new senior secured 5year term loan a facility in an aggregate amount of 8800 million and a new 1000 million senior secured revolving facility “new revolving credit facility” the proceeds of the amended and restated credit facility together with cash on hand were used to prepay the remaining outstanding principal of the existing term loan b facility the term loan a facility and new revolving credit facility mature on may 4 2017 

  

as of december 31 2012 we had 8580 million of indebtedness under the amended and restated credit facility as amended 440 million in current maturities and 8140 million in long term debt 1833 million of cash and cash equivalents and 709 million in shortterm investments 

the amended and restated credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the amended and restated credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing and future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make or hold investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the amended and restated credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis until the termination of the amended and restated credit facility 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the amended and restated credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 325100 and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the amended and restated credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 500100 

in addition our amended and restated credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense 

furthermore we cannot assure you that we will maintain financing activities and cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 

increased costs of financing a reduction in the availability of financing and fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our liquidity operating expenses and results 

adverse conditions in the domestic and global financial markets may increase our costs of financing and adversely affect our ability to refinance debt maturities raise capital or fund other types of obligations any downgrades to our credit rating may likewise increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing 

further our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate for deposits of us dollars “libor” libor tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market we are not required to enter into interest rate swaps to hedge our debt under the amended and restated credit facility and we have not hedged our interest rate exposure and accordingly our interest expense for any particular period may fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates to the extent these interest rates increase our interest expense will increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected see also the discussion of interest rate risk in part i item 3 “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

if we do enter into interest rate swap agreements developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivate instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have 

  

to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivate instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our interest rate hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee the loss of a group of our key professional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel additionally in connection with our ipo we issued founders grants to some of our employees the final tranche of which vested in november 2011 and are therefore no longer effective as a retention tool if the equity incentive compensation plans that we currently have in place do not adequately compensate our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems and its components including our data centers and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error natural disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time we have experienced and may experience again in the future denialofservice attacks while we have been able to defend our systems against such attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the internet occur our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services may be materially and adversely affected for example during fiscal 2012 we migrated certain of our applications and infrastructure to new data centers as a result of this migration we experienced some unanticipated interruption and delay with respect to the performance and delivery of certain of our products while such issues have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations there is no assurance that they or future migrations will not have such effect in the future as a result of such issues we could be required to provide service credits and experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also experience increased cancellations and operating expenses to defend against and protect ourselves from such disruptions and attacks which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

any perceived conflicts of interest resulting from providing products and services to institutional investors in addition to proxy voting recommendations or providing products and services to corporations which are the subject of our proxy recommendations or other products and services could harm our reputation and business 

institutional clients of our governance business rely on iss and certain of its affiliates to provide them with informed proxy vote recommendations benchmark proxy voting guidelines and unbiased analyses of companies’ environmental social and governance attributes the institutional clients of both our performance and risk and governance businesses particularly hedge funds and more active institutional investors may have material economic and other interests in the corporations on which the governance business provides proxy analyses and ratings or which are the subject of our financial research and analysis products and services in some cases these institutional clients pay us a significant amount of money for our performance and risk products and services and accordingly there may be a perception that we might advocate a particular position or provide research that supports a particular conclusion with respect to a corporation in order to satisfy the unique economic or other interests of a particular institutional client as a result institutional clients competitors and 

  

other market participants could raise questions about our ability to provide unbiased services which could harm our reputation 

through our iss corporate services subsidiary we provide products and services to corporate clients who use these services to learn about and improve their corporate governance practices accordingly there is potential for a perceived conflict of interest between the services we provide to institutional clients and the services including our compensation advisory services provided to clients of the iss corporate services subsidiary for example when we provide corporate governance services to a corporate client and at the same time provide proxy vote recommendations to institutional clients regarding that corporation’s proxy items there may be a perception that the governance business team providing research to our institutional clients may treat that corporation more favorably due to its use of services provided by iss corporate services we have implemented an information barrier and other procedures designed to prevent any potential conflict of interest from impacting the ability of our research team to provide unbiased analyses 

the conflict management safeguards that we have implemented may not be adequate to manage these perceived conflicts of interest and clients or competitors may question the integrity of our services in the event that we fail to adequately manage perceived conflicts of interest we could incur reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where we or our clients are located and other events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events 

such events could also have a material adverse effect on our clients for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

we are subject to unanticipated costs in connection with political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability we have established and intend to further grow our presence in mexico the middle east asia africa eastern europe and south america since 2007 we have opened offices in budapest dubai monterrey seoul and shanghai a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the united states and a number of those employees are located in emerging market centers the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally the laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

  

in order to penetrate markets outside of the united states we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market for example the continued success of ipd’s products is dependent on understanding local real estate markets and maintaining relationships with local real estate industry bodies in the jurisdictions in which ipd operates demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and corporate governance and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the united states there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities from time to time we also implement changes to our global corporate structure changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate such changes include but are not limited to proposed legislation to reform us taxation of international business activities 

although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

changes in the legislative regulatory and corporate environments in which iss’s clients operate may adversely impact our financial results 

iss’s historical growth has been due in large part to increased regulatory requirements highly visible corporate scandals increased shareholder activism and corporate chief executive officers and boards of directors that are increasingly concerned about and responsive to shareholder concerns to the extent that any of these trends change the demand for iss’s products and services could be reduced and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation to the extent these regulations change or are not extended to other markets our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 24245 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2012 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired see note 9 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the new york stock exchange for example the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial conditions and the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities see “—changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

  

in connection with our ipo and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or 

  

results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plan 

as of december 31 2012 120114586 shares of our common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of december 31 2012 we had issued 4869843 and 110018 shares of common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 4257779 shares of msci common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to officers and certain employees of riskmetrics pursuant to the riskmetrics group inc 2000 stock option plan riskmetrics group inc 2004 stock option plan institutional shareholder services holdings inc equity incentive plan and riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan collectively the “rmg plans” as of december 31 2012 we had issued 2620951 shares of common stock under the rmg plans in june 2010 we also filed a registration statement assuming 3060090 shares available under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan as of december 31 2012 we had issued 1341704 shares of common stock under this plan which terminated on june 30 2012 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the 

  

shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of our company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your common stock in an acquisition 

we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock 

we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth including growth through acquisitions to repay our debt and to repurchase shares pursuant to our board authorized share repurchase program the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements business conditions corporate law requirements and other factors

our principal sales model in both of our business segments is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for an annual fee paid up front additionally our recurring subscriptions are increasingly related to our managed services offering whereby we oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients fees attributable to annual recurring subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered additionally a portion of our revenues come from clients who use our indices as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indices as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades we also receive revenues from onetime fees related to implementation historical or customized reports advisory and consulting services overages relating to proxy research and voting services fees relating to recovery of securities class action settlements and from certain products and services that are designed for onetime usage 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue growth for the company in total and by product category as well as operating profit growth and the level of profitability as measured by our operating margin in addition we focus on operating metrics including run rates and retention rates to manage the business our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our operating profits into excess cash in the future our revenue growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing product offerings including combining existing product features or data derived from our products to create new products and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we expect to continue to invest in and expand our operating functions and infrastructure including additional product management sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world and additional staff and supporting technology for our research and our data operations and technology functions at the same time managing and controlling our operating expenses is very important to us and a distinct part of our culture over time our goal is to keep the rate of growth of our operating expenses below the rate of growth of our revenues allowing us to expand our operating margins however at times because of significant market opportunities it may be more important for us to invest in our business in order to support increased efforts to attract new clients and to develop new product offerings rather than emphasize shortterm operating margin expansion furthermore in some periods our operating expense growth may exceed our operating revenue growth due to the variability of revenues from several of our products including our equity indices licensed as the basis of etfs and nonrecurring fees

key financial metrics and drivers 

revenues 

our revenues are grouped into the following five product andor service categories 

index and esg 

this category includes subscription fees from msci equity index data and esg research and analytics products fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indices fees from nonrecurring licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from custom msci indices we also generate a limited amount of revenues based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indices 

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indices also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client clients who utilize our esg research and analytics products and services pay an annual subscription fee and access these products and services via a web based application 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes investment inflows and outflows and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee which in some cases may be based on a product providers total expense ratio times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period 

  

risk management analytics products 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to our risk management analytics products including our two major products riskmanager and barraone we have increasing recurring subscriptions to our managed services offering in which our staff oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients other products in this category include hedgeplatform intersight datametrics wealthbench and credit manager the products offer a consistent risk assessment framework for managing and monitoring investments in a variety of asset classes across an organization we are able to grow our revenues by licensing additional users and locations as well as selling additional products and services

see “item 1 business —business segments products and services” for additional details of the products and services that we offer 

operating metrics 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of our total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as our “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscriptions and investment product licenses we currently provide to our clients under renewable contracts assuming all contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects an annualization of the most recent periodic fee earned under such license the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future revenues there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the following table sets forth our run rates and the percentage growth over the periods indicated 

  

  

   changes in run rate between periods may be attributable to among other things increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indices the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indices price changes fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions 

net new recurring subscription sales 

the following table sets forth our net new recurring subscription sales as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of january 1 2010 

 

 retention rates 

  

other key metrics are our “aggregate retention rate” and “core retention rate” which are collectively referred to as “retention rates” these metrics are important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our core retention rate is calculated in the same way as our aggregate retention rate except that the core retention rate does not treat switches between products as a cancellation our aggregate and core retention rates are computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate or core retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indices or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indices aggregate and core retention rates for a nonannual period reflect the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of january 1 2010 

 

 the following table sets forth our core retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of january 1 2010 

 

   

 the quarterly retention rates are calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded cancellations of 287 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 287 million to derive 1149 million of annualized cancellations this 1149 million was then divided by the 7623 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 151 the 151 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 849 for the fourth quarter 

for the calculation of the core retention rate the same methodology was used except the amount of cancellations in the quarter was reduced by the amount of product swaps for example in fourth quarter 2012 we had product swaps of 18 million which was subtracted from the 287 million of actual cancels to derive core cancels of 269 million this 269 million was annualized to derive 1075 million of annualized cancellations which was then divided by the 7623 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 141 the 141 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive the core retention rate of 859 for the fourth quarter 

for the year ended december 31 2012 366 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter historically retention rates have generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 

expenses 

compensation and benefits costs represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and typically have represented approximately 60 of our total operating expenses these costs generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting existing staff compensation and benefit increases and increased staffing levels employing individuals in our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefit costs as of december 31 2012 we had 2759 employees throughout the world of which approximately 406 were located in emerging market centers 

we group our operating expenses into five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data operations and technology software engineering product management and proxy research and voting functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits occupancy market data fees proxy voting fees information technology and other miscellaneous costs the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

selling general and administrative 

this category includes compensation and benefits costs for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense 

  

increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses were for occupancy third party consulting costs and information technology 

restructuring 

during the year ended november 30 2010 msci’s management approved committed to and initiated a plan to restructure the company’s operations due to its acquisition of riskmetrics group inc “riskmetrics” the plan was substantially completed by december 31 2011 restructuring included expenses associated with the elimination of overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs the termination of overlapping vendor contracts and the discontinuance of the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangibles expense relates to the definitelived intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra inc “barra” in june 2004 riskmetrics in june 2010 measurisk llc “measurisk” in july 2010 and ipd group limited “ipd” in november 2012 our intangible assets consist of customer relationships trademarks and trade names technology and software proprietary processes and data and noncompetition agreements we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented we have no indefinitelived intangibles the intangible assets have remaining useful lives ranging from one to 21 years 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets 

other expense income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our credit facilities interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments foreign currency gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition sharebased compensation research and development income taxes deferred revenue goodwill intangible assets shortterm investments hedging instruments fair value of financial assets and liabilities allowance for doubtful accounts and accrued compensation if different assumptions or conditions were to be utilized the results could be materially different from our reported results 

revenue recognition 

in general we apply sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” “ revenue recognition ” in determining revenue recognition accordingly we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

   

when a sales arrangement requires the delivery of more than one product and service revenue is recognized pursuant to the requirements of asc subtopic 60525 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” under the provisions of asc subtopic 60525 elements within a multideliverable arrangement should be considered separate units of accounting if all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

 we provide services to our clients under various software and nonsoftware related arrangements we have signed contracts with substantially all clients that set forth the fees to be paid for our products and services further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client for collectability our application service license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions which generally allow a client to test the solution for a defined period of time before committing to the license if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision we do not recognize subscription revenues until the earlier of the receipt of a written client acceptance or if not notified by the client that it is cancelling the license agreement the expiration of the acceptance period 

our subscription agreements for nonsoftwarerelated application services include provisions that among other things allow clients for no additional fee to receive updates and modifications that may be made from time to time when and if available for the term of the agreement which is typically one year these arrangements do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the application at any time for sales arrangements with multiple deliverables which may include application service subscription and professional services associated with implementation and other services we evaluate each deliverable in these multipleelement arrangements to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting and allocate revenue accordingly 

in most cases we recognize revenues from subscription arrangements ratably over the term of the license agreement pursuant to contract terms the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated the fees are recognized as we supply the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance prior to the license start date for products and services whose fees are based on estimated assets under management linked to our indices or contract values related to futures and options we recognize revenues based on estimates from independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information from the client 

our softwarerelated arrangements do not require significant modification or customization of any underlying software applications being licensed accordingly we recognize software revenues pursuant to the requirements of asc subtopic 985605 “ softwarerevenue recognition ” our subscription agreements for software products include provisions that among other things would allow clients to receive unspecified when and if available future software upgrades for no additional fee as well as the right to use the software products with maintenance and technical support for the term of the agreement which is typically one year software agreements may include other consulting and professional services in accordance with asc subtopic 985605 we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for these elements and therefore recognize software related revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

sharebased compensation 

certain of our employees have received sharebased compensation under certain compensation programs our compensation expense reflects the fair value method of accounting for sharebased payments under asc subtopic 71810 “ compensationstock compensation ” asc subtopic 71810 requires measurement of compensation cost for equitybased awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period net of estimated forfeitures 

the fair value of msci restricted stock units “rsus” is measured as the closing price on the date prior to grant restricted stock units subject to performance conditions “psus” are based on performance measures that impact the amount of shares that each recipient will receive upon vesting psus are granted at fair market value which is measured as the closing price on the date prior to grant 

the fair value of msci standard stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model and the single grant life method under the single grant life method option awards with graded vesting are valued using a single weightedaverage expected option life the fair value of msci stock options that contain stock price contingencies is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which creates a normal distribution of future stock prices which is then used to value the awards based on their individual terms 

  

based on interpretive guidance related to stock compensation the company’s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of sharebased awards that were granted to retirementeligible employees over the course of the prior year in which they were earned rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant a portion of the restricted stock units granted to employees are subject to certain performance conditions the company bases initial accruals of compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered if the estimated number of instruments changes from previous estimates the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change is recognized in compensation cost in the period of the change 

research and development costs 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including asc subtopic 73010 “ research and development ” and asc subtopic 985730 “softwareresearch and development ” asc subtopic 73010 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred the majority of our research and development costs are incurred in developing reviewing and enhancing the methodologies and data models offered within our product portfolio asc subtopic 985730 specifies that costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product as defined within asc subtopic 98520 “softwarecosts of software to be sold leased or marketed” should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material and accordingly we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred research and development costs are included in cost of services in the consolidated statements of income and were approximately 955 million 903 million and 732 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and 2010 respectively research and development costs for the one month ended december 31 2010 were 72 million 

income taxes 

prior to may 2 2008 msci was a member of the morgan stanley consolidated group and our taxable income had been included in the consolidated us federal income tax return of morgan stanley as well as in returns filed by morgan stanley with certain state and local taxing jurisdictions since may 3 2008 we have been filing our us consolidated federal income tax return as a taxable group separate from morgan stanley since may 23 2009 we have been filing all of our state and local income tax returns as a taxpayer separate from morgan stanley our foreign income tax returns have been and continue to be filed on a separate company basis our federal state and local and foreign income tax liability has been computed and presented as if msci was a separate taxpaying entity in the periods presented federal income taxes incurred prior to may 2 2008 and state income taxes incurred prior to may 22 2009 are remitted to morgan stanley pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between the companies 

income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates 

we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we are required to file income tax returns we recorded additional tax expense related to open tax years which we believe is adequate in relation to the potential for assessments these amounts have been recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition we believe the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition however to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves a resolution could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

deferred revenue 

deferred revenues represent amounts billed to customers for products and services in advance of delivery our clients generally pay subscription fees annually or quarterly in advance deferred revenue is amortized ratably over the service period as revenue recognition criteria are met where the service period has not begun and the client has not paid or the contract has not been renewed deferred revenues and accounts receivable are not recognized 

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded as part of our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired our goodwill primarily relates to the acquisitions of barra 

  

riskmetrics measurisk and ipd our goodwill is subject to an impairment test each year or more often if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred pursuant to asc topic 350 “ intangibles—goodwill and other ” 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist the testing for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level which is deemed to be at the level of its business segments goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value if the estimated fair value exceeds the book value goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired if the estimated fair value is below book value however further analysis is required to determine the amount of impairment additionally if the book value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired further analysis is required as the estimated fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective book value on the testing dates no impairment of goodwill was recorded during the years ended december 31 2012 december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 or during the one month ended december 31 2010 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when it is probable and estimable that a receivable will not be collected changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts from november 30 2009 to december 31 2012 were as follows 

 

 accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued nonstock based compensation and benefits expenses a significant portion of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary each year end we determine the amount of discretionary cash bonus pools we also review compensation and benefits expenses throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations we take these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate changes to these factors could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of expense that we report in a particular period accrued non stockbased compensation and related benefits as of december 31 2012 was 1061 million

noncompensation expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 33 to 721 million compared to 745 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease was largely due to lower travel and entertainment costs market data costs recruiting costs and outside professional fees partially offset by the lease exit charge associated with vacating our 88 pine street office space in new york

costs continued to be incurred under this plan throughout the year ended december 31 2011 with the plan becoming substantially completed by december 31 2011 restructuring expense of 36 million consisting of approximately 29 million of expense associated with eliminating duplicative occupancy costs and 07 million of expense associated with the elimination of overlapping positions was recognized during the year ended december 31 2011 restructuring expense of 89 million consisting of approximately 66 million of expense associated with the elimination of overlapping positions 13 million of expense associated with duplicative occupancy costs and 10 million of expense associated with the discontinuance of the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite was recognized during the year ended november 30 2010 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles expense relates to the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 riskmetrics in june 2010 and measurisk in july 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 amortization of intangibles expense totaled 658 million compared to 416 million for the year ended november 30 2010 the increase was the result of recognizing a full year’s worth of amortization in the year ended december 31 2011 associated with the intangibles acquired in the acquisitions made during the second half of the year ended november 30 2010 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

for the years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements totaled 194 million and 174 million respectively the increase was primarily the result of recognizing a full year’s worth of depreciation of property equipment and leasehold improvements in the year ended december 31 2011 acquired as the result of the acquisitions made during the second half of the year ended november 30 2010 partially offset by the impact of assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives 

other expense income net 

other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2011 was 586 million an increase of 60 million compared to 526 million for the year ended november 30 2010 the increase primarily reflects higher interest expense resulting from the senior secured term loan we entered into on june 1 2010 and subsequently refinanced in march 2011 as part of our acquisition of riskmetrics 

income taxes 

the provision for income tax expense was 900 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 467 compared to 613 million for the year ended november 30 2010 our effective tax rate was 342 and 400 for the years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively 

the effective tax rate of 342 for the year ended december 31 2011 reflected our operating tax rate and the impact of the change in our intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of three of our foreign operations which decreased the rate by 11 percentage points the benefit of the federal research and development credit which decreased the rate by 05 percentage points and other discrete items which decreased the rate by 04 percentage points 

segment results of operations 

  

the table below reflects the results of operations by segment for the years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 

 

 our operating segments were established as a result of the acquisitions we made during the second half of the year ended november 30 2010 the explanation of segment results excluding the impact of the acquisitions made would be substantially the same as the whole company results discussed in “results of operations” above 

results of operations 

one month transition period ended december 31 2010 compared to one month ended december 31 2009 

 

   

 the results of riskmetrics and measurisk were not included in our results of operations until their acquisition dates of june 1 2010 and july 30 2010 respectively as a result the primary reason for the changes between the one month ended december 31 2010 and the one month ended december 31 2009 was the impact of the acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations proceeds from the maturity and sale of our shortterm investments existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our credit facilities we intend to use these sources of liquidity to service our existing and future debt obligations and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth 

on june 1 2010 we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with morgan stanley senior funding inc as administrative agent morgan stanley  co incorporated as collateral agent and the other lenders party thereto which was comprised of i the 12750 million 2010 term loan and ii the 1000 million 2010 revolving credit facility we were required to repay 100 of the principal of the 2010 term loan per year in quarterly installments the 2010 credit facility also contained a number of mandatory prepayment requirements including a requirement to repay a specified amount of the 2010 term loan annually from a portion of our excess cash flows as defined in the 2010 credit facility which varied based on our leverage ratio any remaining principal of the 2010 term loan was to be payable on the final maturity date of the facility in february 2011 we made a prepayment of 560 million on the 2010 term loan from our excess cash flows 

on march 14 2011 we completed the repricing of the thenexisting senior secured term loan facility under the 2010 credit facility pursuant to amendment no 2 to the 2010 credit facility “amendment no 2” amendment no 2 provided for the incurrence of the 2011 term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 11250 million the proceeds of the 2011 term loan together with 876 million of cash on hand were used to repay the remaining 12126 million outstanding balance of the 2010 term loan in full

on may 4 2012 we amended and restated our existing senior credit facilities by entering into the amended and restated credit facility which consists of the 2012 term loan in an aggregate amount of 8800 million and the 1000 million 2012 revolving credit facility the proceeds of the amended and restated credit facility together with cash on hand were used to repay the remaining outstanding principal of the thenexisting 2011 term loan the 2012 term loan and the 2012 revolving credit facility mature on may 4 2017 we are required to repay 500 of the 2012 term loan in quarterly payments over the first two years 1000 of the 2012 term loan in quarterly payments over the next two years and 7000 of the 2012 term loan in quarterly payments over the final year in connection with the repayment of the 2011 term loan we terminated our thenexisting interest rate swaps and are not required to enter into new interest rate swaps to hedge our debt under the amended and restated credit facility

cash flows 

 

 cash used in provided by operating investing and financing activities 

 

   

 cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents were 1833 million and 2522 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively as of december 31 2012 and 2011 835 million and 1301 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries which could be subject to us federal income taxation on repatriation to the us and some of which could be subject to local country taxes if repatriated to the us in addition repatriation of some foreign cash is further restricted by local laws 

shortterm investments were 709 million and 1405 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively all of the shortterm investments were held by us corporations and were not subject to repatriation considerations at either december 31 2012 or 2011 

we believe that domestic cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect existing foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 3471 million and 2550 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the year over year increase primarily reflects improved billings and collections from customers and the timing of lease payments for our new office space at 7 world trade center in new york and in rockville maryland during the year ended december 31 2012 we received 79 million in cash from the landlord as a lease inducement related to the 7 world trade center office space 

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs market data costs interest expenses and income taxes the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is historically at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 944 million and 906 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the 38 million increase in cash used in investing activities primarily reflects 1196 million of cash net of cash received used to acquire ipd and 218 million of increased capital expenditures as we prepared our new corporate headquarters for occupation in the year ended december 31 2012 partially offsetting these outflows was 1372 million less cash used to purchase investments compared to 2011 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 3230 million and 1780 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the year over year change primarily reflects 443 million of increased cash payments made to service amend and refinance our credit facility during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2011 additionally in the year ended december 31 2012 we paid 1000 million to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program with no similar program in place in the prior year 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and obligations arising from borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility as amended the following summarizes our contractual obligations 

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201104 “ fair value measurements topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss” or asu 201104 asu 201104 changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” asu 201104 also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level 3 inputs this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 the adoption of asu 201104 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 “ reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income ” or asu 201302 the amendments in this update require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the income statement or in the notes significant amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective net income line item this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2012 we do not expect the adoption of asu 201302 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating expense income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 148 and 156 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are 

  

invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 126 and 134 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2012 583 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 218 were in japanese yen and 121 were in british pounds sterling for the year ended december 31 2011 606 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 219 were in japanese yen and 99 were in british pounds sterling 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 345 and 341 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds sterling swiss francs euros hong kong dollars hungarian forints indian rupees and mexican pesos expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency a gain or loss results from the change in value of the functional currency we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk in part through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact associated with intercompany loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 26 million and foreign currency exchange gains of 11 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and foreign currency exchange losses of 30 million for the year ended november 30 2010 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 1833 million and 2522 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively these amounts were held primarily in checking and money market accounts in the countries where we maintain banking relationships the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes at december 31 2012 and 2011 we had invested 709 million and 1405 million respectively in debt securities with maturity dates ranging from 91 to 360 days from the date of purchase we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates related to these positions declines in interest rates however will reduce future interest income 

borrowings under the 2012 term loan bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of libor and a margin of 225 which margin will be subject to adjustment based on our leverage ratio as of december 31 2012 the 2012 term loan bears interest at 246 assuming an average of 8360 million of variable rate debt outstanding a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in libor for a one year period would result in approximately 84 million of additional interest rate expense

 because of its inherent limitations a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements further because of changes in conditions effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time our system contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 based on the criteria described in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

based on this assessment management including the company’s ceo and cfo concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

  

whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer you should read the section titled “forwardlooking statements” beginning on page 1 for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index and analytics products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data throughout our businesses we utilize certain data provided by third party data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world as of december 31 2011 we had over 200 such data suppliers if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges many of these data suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us for example iss relies on a data feed agreement with broadridge financial solutions which allows for a large number of proxy ballots to be received and proxy votes to be processed electronically minimizing the manual aspects of the proxy voting process and limiting the risk of error inherent in manual processes if the data feed agreement with broadridge was terminated we would have to incur significant expenses in order to input our clients’ voting instructions directly into broadridge’s proprietary electronic voting systems and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected since iss also competes with broadridge in some markets with respect to providing certain aspects of proxy voting services there may be circumstances under which broadridge may have an incentive to not renew iss’s data feed agreement or to offer renewal terms which we may deem unreasonable from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted 

  

use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers have sought and others may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media including the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies procedures and training to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls unauthorized access to or disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized access disclosure or misappropriation could damage our reputation andor result in claims against us by our clients and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if a failure of our internal controls results in a security or privacy breach we could also incur increased operating expenses to remediate the problems caused by the breach and prevent future breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indices from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indices can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indices our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail and we inadvertently disclose or an individual deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indices our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list exchange traded funds or other financial products based on our indices only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information 

  

barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our indices if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our indices which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

any perceived conflicts of interest resulting from providing products and services to institutional investors in addition to proxy voting recommendations or providing products and services to corporations which are the subject of our proxy recommendations or other products and services could harm our reputation and business 

institutional clients of our governance business rely on iss to provide them with informed proxy vote recommendations benchmark proxy voting guidelines and unbiased analyses of companies’ environmental social and governance attributes the institutional clients of both our performance and risk and governance businesses particularly hedge funds and more active institutional investors may have material economic and other interests in the corporations on which iss provides proxy analyses and ratings or which are the subject of our financial research and analysis products and services in some cases these institutional clients pay us a significant amount of money for our performance and risk products and services and accordingly there may be a perception that we might advocate a particular position or provide research that supports a particular conclusion with respect to a corporation in order to satisfy the unique economic or other interests of a particular institutional client as a result institutional clients competitors and other market participants could raise questions about our ability to provide unbiased services which could harm our reputation 

through our iss corporate services subsidiary we provide products and services to corporate clients who use these services to learn about and improve their corporate governance practices accordingly there is a potential conflict of interest between the services we provide to institutional clients and the services including our compensation advisory services provided to clients of the iss corporate services subsidiary for example when we provide corporate governance services to a corporate client and at the same time provide proxy vote recommendations to institutional clients regarding that corporation’s proxy items there may be a perception that the iss team providing research to our institutional clients may treat that corporation more favorably due to its use of our services we have implemented an information barrier and other procedures designed to prevent any potential conflict of interest from impacting the ability of our research team to provide unbiased analyses 

the conflict management safeguards that we have implemented may not be adequate to manage these potential conflicts of interest and clients or competitors may question the integrity of our services in the event that we fail to adequately manage perceived conflicts of interest we could incur reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and pending thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights as we have experienced even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we will be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent 

  

as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have in recent years increasingly pursued patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model or software application we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time such complaints are filed by or we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow we have made are making and expect to continue making expenditures related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us from time to time we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure we monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to reengineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts our use of certain third party software and data has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use in the future resulting in increased software or data acquisition costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industry in which we operate and the impact of technological change on our products we must continually introduce new products and services enhance including through integration existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services this requires accurate anticipation of clients’ changing needs and emerging investment trends we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate the revenues required to provide the desired results 

if among other things we fail to accurately anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our 

  

clients if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated or if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely we could lose market share and clients to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations also see “—if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

integrating existing products and platforms and transitioning clients to enhanced products and services presents execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product there may also be consolidation among our competitors in the form of joint ventures or other business arrangements which could allow for better capitalized competitors 

in addition barriers to entry may be low in many cases including for singlepurpose product companies the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or equity indices financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those arising from current economic conditions may lead certain clients to seek products at a lower cost than what we provide these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “part i—item 1 business—our competition” above 

our business is dependent on the financial viability of our clients if our clients are negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets and are forced to shutdown consolidate limit or reduce spending our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

most of our clients are in the financial services industry for example asset managers accounted for 605 and 524 of our revenues as of december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively the global financial crisis led to the closure or consolidation of a number of our clients including asset manager brokerdealer and hedge fund clients such events impacted our financial results including our run rates and aggregate and core retention rates in 2009 and 2010 and to a lesser extent 2011 ongoing economic weakness and volatility continues to cause uncertainty and pressure on our clients’ spending resulting in longer selling and renewing cycles increased sales expenses and potentially increased cancellations 

if such trends continue we may not be able to generate or accurately plan for future growth and demand for our products may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of the global financial crisis the us congress undertook major financial reform which led to the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank act the doddfrank act will have a significant impact on many aspects of the way in which the financial services industry conducts business and will impose substantial new regulation on and regulatory oversight of a wide variety of financial services institutions although many 

  

of the effects of the doddfrank act will be largely unknown until the regulations have been finalized and implemented complying with its requirements could negatively impact the business operations and financial viability of many of our clients which in turn could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

if our clients do not remain financially viable or if the negative conditions in the financial markets persist or worsen we may be forced to increase our provisions for bad debts which could adversely affect our profitability 

consolidation within our target markets may affect our business 

consolidation in the financial services industry could reduce our existing client base and the number of potential clients for example the recent global financial crisis led to the closure or merger of a number of our clients including brokerdealer asset manager and hedge fund clients if consolidation continues it may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth and may reduce demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring portfolios to the extent our clients significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our revenues and earnings attributable to assetbased fees may be affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets 

clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets these assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they accounted for approximately 156 162 and 167 of revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 447 452 and 439 of the revenues from our ten largest clients for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively the value of an investment product’s assets can increase or decrease along with market performance and inflows and outflows which impact our revenues volatile capital markets such as those experienced recently as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example as of december 31 2011 the monthend value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 3016 billion which was 30 lower than the value of such assets as of november 30 2010 and the value of such assets at november 30 2010 was 328 higher than the value of such assets as of november 30 2009 if the value of passive investments linked to our indices decreases our assetbased fee revenues are likely to decline 

a portion of our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our indices could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenues streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients our clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to try to decrease our fees correspondingly or otherwise lead to a reduction of our fees in certain cases for example competition is intense and increasing among our clients that provide exchange traded funds the fees they charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers additionally clients that have licensed our indices to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indices and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in august 2011 blackrock inc which together with its affiliates accounted for 81 and 99 of our revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively announced that it was seeking regulatory clearance to create indices for use as the basis of exchange traded funds that it would manage 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 258 and 274 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock inc and affiliates “blackrock” accounted for 81 of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 approximately 839 and 829 respectively of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s etfs based on msci indices 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services during that annual period for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term a disproportionately high percentage of contract value in the governance business comes up for renewal in december while we believe the annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop internally certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent 

  

that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “—to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to manage our operating costs as anticipated or our operating costs are higher than expected our operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience higher than expected operating costs including increased personnel costs occupancy costs selling and marketing costs investments in geographic expansion communication costs travel costs software development costs professional fees and other costs additionally we may not fully realize our strategic initiatives to manage our cost structure if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by global factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates inflation and ratings downgrades 

financial markets in the united states europe and asia have experienced disruption in the past year and nearterm predictions for the growth of the global economy remain weak concerns over the european debt crisis the potential collapse of the euro ratings downgrades the ability of the us government to manage the us deficit and prolonged high unemployment have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and markets going forward while we do not concentrate a significant amount of business in any one eurozone country we did derive 310 of our 2011 revenue from europe the general financial instability in any eurozone country could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the european union unfavorable changes in global economic 

  

conditions may negatively impact the demand for our products and services and may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services or cause them to go out of business entirely resulting in increased reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable cash flows may also be impacted resulting in restricted access to capital markets changes in currency exchange rates and delayed or underpayment by our customers adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth including in emerging market centers has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow internally or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting training and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” 

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any future acquisitions could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating expense income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 156 and 163 of operating revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

while we generally invoice our clients in us dollars we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 approximately 134 and 128 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 606 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 219 were in japanese yen and 99 were in british pounds for the fiscal year ended november 30 2010 559 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 282 were in japanese yen and 103 were in british pounds 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 341 and 342 of our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds swiss francs hong kong dollars euros hungarian forints indian rupees mexican pesos and japanese yen expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange gains of 11 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 the gains on foreign currency exchange were primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar as compared to the japanese yen in the fiscal year we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 we may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world in addition we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 

 

  

  

   

  

 we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products however these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

iss’s products and services support the proxy voting processes of clients consequently we may be exposed to potential liability claims brought by iss’s clients or third parties as a result of the operational failure of our products and services 

iss’s products and services support the proxy voting processes of clients if iss were to fail to provide the services provided for in its client contracts we could be required to provide credits to its clients and in some cases we may be subject to contractual penalties iss’s client agreements generally have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by its clients or other third parties based on the operational failure of its products and services however these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of management personnel financial and other resources in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in connection with our acquisition of riskmetrics on june 1 2010 we entered into a senior secured credit agreement which is comprised of i a 12750 million sixyear term loan facility and ii a 1000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility “new credit facility” see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” the new credit facility replaced our senior credit facility of 709 million and the senior secured facilities of riskmetrics of 2067 million outstanding as of may 31 2010 on march 14 2011 we completed the repricing of the existing senior secured term loan facility under the new credit facility pursuant to amendment no 2 which provided for the incurrence of a new senior secured loan in an aggregate principal amount of 11250 million the proceeds of this term loan together with cash on hand were used to repay the outstanding balance of the existing senior secured term loan this term loan matures in 2017 

as of december 31 2011 we had 10778 million of indebtedness under the new credit facility as amended 113 million in current maturities and 10665 million in long term debt 2522 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1405 million in shortterm investments 

the new credit facility as amended is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the new credit facility as amended contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make or hold investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the new credit facility as amended also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the new credit facility as amended 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the new credit facility as amended measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed 325100 and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the new credit facility as amended measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least 500100 

in addition our new credit facility as amended contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense because the new credit facility resulted in a substantial increase in our level of indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio following the completion of the acquisition in comparison to periods prior to the acquisition the potential for the occurrence of the consequences described in the preceding sentence could be increased compared to periods prior to the acquisition 

  

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee the loss of a group of our key professional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel additionally in connection with our ipo we issued founders grants to some of our employees the final tranche of which vested in november 2011 and are therefore no longer effective as a retention tool if the equity incentive plans that we currently have in place do not adequately compensate our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error national disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time we have experienced and may experience again in the future denialofservice attacks while we have been able to defend our systems against such attacks in the past there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future our ability to effectively use the internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the internet occur our reputation and our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients including those clients for whom we provide managed services may be materially and adversely affected we could be required to provide service credits and experience cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services resulting in decreased revenues we may also experience increased cancellations and operating expenses to defend against and protect us from such disruptions and attacks which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where we or our clients are located and other events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events 

such events could also have a material adverse effect on our clients for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the 

  

data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

we are subject to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability we have established and intend to further grow our presence in mexico the middle east asia africa eastern europe and south america in the last few years we have opened offices in budapest dubai monterrey seoul and shanghai a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the united states and a number of those employees are located in emerging market centers in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

in order to penetrate markets outside of the united states we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and corporate governance and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the united states there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

we may incur unanticipated costs in connection with establishing and maintaining offices in emerging market locations 

our plans call for us to continue to increase the proportion of our employees in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 

  

although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

changes in the legislative regulatory and corporate environments in which iss’s clients operate may adversely impact our financial results 

iss’s historical growth has been due in large part to increased regulatory requirements highly visible corporate scandals increased shareholder activism and corporate chief executive officers and boards of directors that are increasingly concerned about and responsive to shareholder concerns to the extent that any of these trends change the demand for iss’s products and services could be reduced and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation to the extent these regulations change or are not extended to other markets our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 23535 million recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2011 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring management’s judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired 

we have engaged in hedging transactions and may engage in other hedging transactions which involve risks that could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

in july 2010 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk and to manage interest expense on march 22 2011 we terminated our thenexisting interest rate swaps and simultaneously entered into new interest rate swaps to hedge the 2011 term loan variablerate debt and we may engage in similar transactions in the future as of december 31 2011 the interest rate swaps had an aggregate notional principal amount of 4198 million and a fair value liability of 24 million our interest rate swaps effectively changed a portion of our variablerate debt obligations pursuant to our credit facilities to fixedrate debt obligations developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivate instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivate instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our economic hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the new york stock exchange for example the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial conditions and the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities see “—changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

in connection with our ipo and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our class a common stock the price of our class a common stock could decline 

the trading market for our class a common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for you 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our class a common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our class a common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of class a common stock and options to purchase shares of class a common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plan 

as of december 31 2011 121212191 shares of our class a common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of december 31 2011 we had issued 4280489 and 84215 shares of class a common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 4257779 shares of msci class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to officers and certain employees of riskmetrics pursuant to the riskmetrics group inc 2000 stock option plan riskmetrics group inc 2004 stock option plan institutional shareholder services holdings inc equity incentive plan and riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan collectively the “rmg plans” as of december 31 2011 we had issued 1915354 shares of class a common stock under the rmg plans in june 2010 we also filed a registration statement assuming 3060090 shares available under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan as of december 31 2011 we had issued 973968 shares of class a common stock under this plan which terminates on june 30 2012 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our class a common stock 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our class a common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our class a common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of our company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your class a common stock in an acquisition 

we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth including growth through acquisitions the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements business conditions corporate law requirements and other factors

overview 

we are a leading global provider of investment decision support tools including indices portfolio risk and performance analytics and corporate governance products and services our products and services address multiple markets asset classes and geographies and are sold to a diverse client base including asset owners such as pension funds endowments foundations central banks family offices and insurance companies institutional and retail asset managers such as managers of pension assets mutual funds exchange traded funds “etfs” hedge funds and private wealth financial intermediaries such as banks brokerdealers exchanges custodians and investment consultants and corporate clients as of december 31 2011 we had offices in 30 cities in 20 countries to help serve our diverse client base with 544 of our revenue from clients in the americas 319 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 137 in asia and australia based on revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 

our principal sales model in both of our business segments is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for an annual fee paid up front additionally we have increasing recurring subscriptions to our managed services offering whereby we oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients our revenues also come from clients who use our indices as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs we also derive revenues from certain institutional clients that use our indices as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indices as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades we also receive revenues from onetime fees related to implementation historical or customized reports advisory and consulting services overages relating to the proxy research and voting services fees relating to recovery of securities class action settlements and from certain products and services that are designed for onetime usage 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue growth for the company in total and by product category as well as operating profit growth and the level of profitability as measured by our operating margin our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our operating profits into excess cash in the future our revenue growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing product offerings including combining existing product features or data derived from our products to create new products and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we expect to continue to invest in and expand our operating functions and infrastructure including additional product management sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world and additional staff and supporting technology for our research and our data operations and technology functions at the same time managing and controlling our operating expenses is very important to us and a distinct part of our culture over time our goal is to keep the rate of growth of our operating expenses below the rate of growth of our revenues allowing us to expand our operating margins however at times because of significant market opportunities it may be more important for us to invest in our business in order to support increased efforts to attract new clients and to develop new product 

  

offerings rather than emphasize shortterm operating margin expansion furthermore in some periods our operating expense growth may exceed our operating revenue growth due to the variability of revenues from several of our products including our equity indices licensed as the basis of etfs and nonrecurring fees 

operating segments 

following our acquisition of riskmetrics on june 1 2010 we began operating as two segments the performance and risk business and the governance business see note 14 “segment information” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about msci’s operating segments

key financial metrics and drivers 

revenues 

our principal sales model in both of our business segments is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for an annual fee paid up front for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 7325 million or 813 of our revenues was attributable to annual recurring subscriptions the fees attributable to annual recurring subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered additionally 1360 million of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs we also derive revenues from certain institutional clients that use our indices as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our 

  

intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indices as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades we also receive revenues from onetime fees related to implementation historical or customized reports advisory and consulting services overages relating to the proxy research and voting services fees relating to recovery of securities class action settlements and from certain products and services that are designed for onetime usage 

our revenues are grouped into the following five product andor service categories 

index and esg 

this category includes subscription fees from msci equity index data and esg research and analytics products fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indices fees from nonrecurring licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from custom msci indices we also generate a limited amount of revenues based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indices 

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indices also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client clients who utilize our esg research and analytics products and services pay an annual subscription fee and access these products and services via a web based application 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in the value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes investment inflows and outflows and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period

see “item 1 business—business segments products and services” for additional details of the products and services that we offer 

operating metrics 

because of the impact of seasonality on our operating metrics our run rates net new recurring subscription sales and retention rates have been restated to reflect the change in fiscal year end in order to provide a more meaningful comparison we do not experience this seasonality with respect to the financial information reported in our “results of operations” the restated run rates and retention rates assume the change in fiscal year end occurred on january 1 2009 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of our total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as our “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking fees for the next 12 months from all subscriptions and investment product licenses we currently provide to our clients under renewable contracts assuming all contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects an annualization of the most recent periodic fee earned under such license the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future fees there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the following table sets forth our run rates and the percentage growth over the periods indicated run rates have been adjusted to conform to the product categorization used for accounting revenues in order to provide a more meaningful comparison the historical numbers for 2010 and 2009 have been adjusted to include riskmetrics as if the acquisition had occurred on january 1 2009 

 

  

 changes in run rate between periods reflect increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indices the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indices price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates

other key metrics are our “aggregate retention rate” and “core retention rate” which are collectively referred to as “retention rates” these metrics are important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of 

  

the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our core retention rate is calculated in the same way as our aggregate retention rate except that the core retention rate does not treat switches between products as a cancellation our aggregate and core retention rates are computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate or core retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indices or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indices aggregate and core retention rates for a nonannual period reflect the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in the case of 2010 and 2009 as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of the dates indicated 

 

   

the following table sets forth our core retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of the dates indicated 

 

 the quarterly retention rates are calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded cancellations of 272 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 272 million to derive 1090 million of annualized cancellations this 1090 million was then divided by the 7051 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 155 the 155 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 845 for the fourth quarter 

for the calculation of the core retention rate the same methodology was used except the amount of cancellations in the quarter was reduced by the amount of product swaps for example in fourth quarter 2011 we had product swaps of 05 million which was subtracted from the 272 million of actual cancels to derive core cancels of 268 million this 268 million was annualized to derive 1071 million of annualized cancellations which was then divided by the 7051 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 152 the 152 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive the core retention rate of 848 for the fourth quarter 

for the year ended december 31 2011 379 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter historically retention rates have generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 

expenses 

compensation and benefits costs represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and typically have represented approximately 60 of our total operating expenses these costs generally 

  

contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting existing staff compensation and benefit increases and increased staffing levels employing individuals in our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefit costs as of december 31 2011 we had 2429 employees throughout the world of which approximately 392 were located in emerging market centers 

we group our operating expenses into five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data operations and technology software engineering product management and proxy research and voting functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits occupancy market data fees proxy voting fees information technology and other miscellaneous costs prior to may 22 2009 a portion of these costs were allocated to us by morgan stanley which was the controlling shareholder through that date the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

selling general and administrative 

this category includes compensation and benefits costs for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses were for occupancy third party consulting costs and information technology prior to may 22 2009 a portion of these costs were allocated to us by morgan stanley 

restructuring 

during the year ended november 30 2010 msci’s management approved committed to and initiated a plan to restructure the company’s operations due to its acquisition of riskmetrics we believe that the plan was substantially completed by december 31 2011 restructuring includes expenses associated with the elimination of overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs the termination of overlapping vendor contracts and the discontinuance of the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangibles expense relates to the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 riskmetrics in june 2010 and measurisk in july 2010 our intangible assets consist primarily of technology and software trademarks client relationships and noncompetition agreements the intangible assets have remaining useful lives ranging from one to 19 years 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets 

  

other expense income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our credit facilities interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments foreign currency gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition sharebased compensation research and development and software capitalization income taxes deferred revenue goodwill intangible assets foreign currency translation shortterm investments hedging instruments fair value of financial assets and liabilities allowance for doubtful accounts and accrued compensation if different assumptions or conditions were to be utilized the results could be materially different from our reported results 

revenue recognition 

revenue related to our nonsoftwarerelated recurring arrangements is recognized pursuant to the requirements of financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 60525 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” under the provisions of asc subtopic 60525 transactions with multiple elements should be considered separate units of accounting if all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

 we have signed subscription agreements with substantially all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for nonsoftwarerelated products include provisions that among other things allow clients for no additional fee to receive updates and modifications that may be made from time to time for the term of the agreement typically one year as we currently do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element of the transaction we do not account for the delivered item as a separate element accordingly we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our softwarerelated recurring revenue arrangements do not require significant modification or customization of any underlying software applications being licensed accordingly we recognize software revenues excluding the energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products pursuant to the requirements of asc subtopic 985605 “ softwarerevenue recognition ” in accordance with asc subtopic 985605 we begin to recognize revenues from subscriptions maintenance and client technical support and professional services when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence of a legally binding arrangement 2 delivery has occurred 3 client fee is deemed fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

  

we have signed subscription agreements with substantially all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for software products include provisions that among other things would allow clients to receive unspecified future software upgrades for no additional fee as well as the right to use the software products with maintenance for the term of the agreement typically one year as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” for these elements except for the support related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we do not account for these elements separately accordingly except for revenues related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our software license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions such provisions generally allow a client to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision we do not record subscription revenues until the earlier of the receipt of a written client acceptance or if not notified by the client that it is cancelling the license agreement the expiration of the acceptance period 

for our energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value if all undelivered elements exist in substantially all of our contracts the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support the fair value of support is determined based upon what the fees for the support are for clients who purchase support separately under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue support fees for these products are recognized ratably over the support period 

we apply sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” “ revenue recognition ” in determining revenue recognition related to clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets under management or contract volumes these fees are calculated based upon estimated assets in the investment product or contract volumes obtained either through independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information of the client 

we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

 we have signed contracts with substantially all clients that are licensed to use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated these fees are billed in arrears after the fees have been earned the fees are earned as we supply the indices to the client we assess the creditworthiness of these clients prior to entering into a contract and regularly review the receivable balances related to them 

sharebased compensation 

certain of our employees have received sharebased compensation under certain compensation programs our compensation expense reflects the fair value method of accounting for sharebased payments under asc subtopic 71810 “ compensationstock compensation ” asc subtopic 71810 requires measurement of compensation cost for equitybased awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period net of estimated forfeitures 

  

the fair value of msci restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the grant date fair value of msci’s common stock measured as the closing price on the date of grant the fair value of msci standard stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model and the single grant life method under the single grant life method option awards with graded vesting are valued using a single weightedaverage expected option life the fair value of msci stock options that contain stock price contingencies is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which creates a normal distribution of future stock prices which is then used to value the awards based on their individual terms 

we reserved approximately 43 million shares of common stock for outstanding vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock awards assumed as part of the acquisition of riskmetrics on june 1 2010 see note 3 “acquisitions” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements or further information about our acquisition of riskmetrics the fair values of stock options assumed were estimated using a hullwhite lattice optionpricing model the hullwhite model is commonly used for estimating the fair value of inthemoney and outofthemoney options as it explicitly models the exercise behavior of option holders considering the amount by which each such grant is in or outofthemoney the major assumptions utilized are the stock price the remaining contractual term the remaining time to vest forfeiture behavior dividend yield the riskfree interest rate expected volatility and the early exercise multiple 

based on interpretive guidance related to stock compensation our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of sharebased awards that were granted to retirementeligible employees over the course of the current year rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant a portion of the restricted stock units granted to employees are subject to certain performance conditions we base initial accruals of compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered if the estimated number of instruments changes from previous estimates the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change is recognized in compensation costs in the period of the change 

research and development and software capitalization 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including asc subtopic 73010 “ research and development ” and asc subtopic 985730 “softwareresearch and development ” asc subtopic 73010 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred asc subtopic 985730 specifies that costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material and accordingly we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred research and development costs are included in cost of services in the consolidated statements of income and were approximately 903 million 732 million and 533 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively research and development costs for the one month ended december 31 2010 were 72 million 

income taxes 

prior to may 2 2008 we were a member of the morgan stanley consolidated group and our taxable income was included in the consolidated us federal income tax return of morgan stanley as well as in returns filed by morgan stanley with certain state and local taxing jurisdictions after may 2 2008 upon the disposition by morgan stanley of a portion of its equity interest in us we were no longer eligible to join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with morgan stanley we have filed and will continue to file our consolidated us federal income tax return as a taxable group separate from morgan stanley our foreign income tax returns have been filed on a separate company basis our federal and foreign income tax liability has been computed and presented in the consolidated financial statements as if we were a separate taxpaying entity in the periods presented the state and local liability presented in these statements reflects the fact that we are 

  

included in certain filings of morgan stanley through may 22 2009 the date on which morgan stanley disposed of its remaining equity interest in us and that our tax liability is affected by the attributions of the morgan stanley group we continued to file certain state income tax returns with morgan stanley on a consolidated combined or unitary basis under applicable state law through may 22 2009 after may 22 2009 we were no longer eligible for inclusion in any state or local consolidated combined or unitary return filed by morgan stanley and from that date forward we have been filing the relevant state income tax returns as a separate taxable group 

income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates 

we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we are required to file income tax returns we have recorded additional tax expense related to open tax years which we believe is adequate in relation to the potential for assessments these amounts have been recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition we believe the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition however to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves a resolution could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

deferred revenue 

deferred revenues represent amounts billed to customers for services and maintenance in advance of performing the services our clients normally pay subscription fees annually or quarterly in advance deferred revenue is amortized ratably over the service period as revenue recognition criteria are met where the service period has not begun or been renewed deferred revenues and accounts receivable are not recognized 

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded as part of our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired the carrying amount of our goodwill is 17086 million primarily relating to the acquisitions of barra riskmetrics and measurisk our goodwill is subject to an impairment test each year or more often if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred pursuant to asc topic 350 “ intangibles—goodwill and other ” 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist the testing for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level which is generally at the level of its business segments goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value if the estimated fair value exceeds the book value goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired if the estimated fair value is below book value however further analysis is required to determine the amount of impairment additionally if the book value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired further analysis is required as the estimated fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective book value no impairment of goodwill was recorded during the years ended december 31 2011 november 30 2010 and 2009 or during the one month ended december 31 2010 

our previous accounting policy was to conduct the annual goodwill impairment test as of june 1 effective in the quarter ended september 30 2011 we elected to change our accounting policy to begin conducting the annual goodwill impairment test on july 1 the change to the annual goodwill impairment testing date is preferable under the circumstances as it moves the impairment testing outside of our normal second quarterend reporting process to a date in the third quarter when resources are less constrained which is consistent with the 

  

timing of the testing date prior to the change in the fiscal yearend the resulting change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date will not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge of our goodwill as it was impracticable to objectively determine projected cash flows and related valuation estimates as of each july 1 for periods prior to july 1 2011 we prospectively applied the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date from july 1 2011 the application of this change in accounting policy did not result in any impairment charges recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

effective july 1 2011 we adopted the provisions of accounting standards update 201108 “ testing goodwill for impairment” or asu 201108 which provides us the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment the qualitative assessment is based on reviewing the totality of several factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other entity specific events for example changes in management or other events such as selling or disposing of a reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on qualitative factors to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit then entities are required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test see “recent accounting pronouncements” below for further information regarding accounting pronouncements released that may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

intangible assets consist of those definitelived intangibles from the acquisitions of barra in june 2004 riskmetrics in june 2010 and measurisk in july 2010 we amortize definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented we have no indefinitelived intangibles the intangible assets have remaining useful lives ranging from one to 19 years 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when it is probable and estimable that a receivable will not be collected changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts from december 1 2008 to december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

  

   

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued nonstock based compensation and benefits expenses a significant portion of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary each year end we determine the amount of discretionary cash bonus pools we also review compensation and benefits expenses throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations we take these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate changes to these factors could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of expense that we report in a particular period accrued non stockbased compensation and related benefits as of december 31 2011 was 1007 million 

factors affecting the comparability of results 

acquisition of riskmetrics 

on june 1 2010 we completed our acquisition of riskmetrics in a cashandstock transaction valued at approximately 15724 million in connection with the acquisition we entered into a senior secured credit agreement which was comprised of i a 12750 million sixyear term loan facility “2010 term loan” and ii a 1000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility we assigned a significant value to the intangible assets of riskmetrics as part of the acquisition which increased the amortization expense we recognized for the year ended december 31 2011 see note 10 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information we also have incurred increased interest expense as a result of the credit facility we entered into in connection with the acquisition 

acquisition of measurisk 

on july 30 2010 we acquired measurisk to expand our product offerings to hedge fund investors the value we assigned to the intangible assets of measurisk further increased the amortization expense that we recognized for the year ended december 31 2011 see note 10 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

the results of riskmetrics and measurisk were not included in our results of operations until their acquisition dates of june 1 2010 and july 30 2010 respectively the riskmetrics acquisition has had a significant impact on our results of operations and will affect the comparability of our results in the future 

restructuring 

in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we initiated a plan to restructure the company’s operations to eliminate overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs terminate overlapping vendor contracts and discontinue the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite we initiated restructuring activities during the third quarter of 2010 and believe that the plan was substantially completed by december 31 2011 see “—restructuring” below and note 4 “restructuring” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about msci’s restructuringrelated activities and estimated costs 

term loan repricing 

on march 14 2011 we completed the repricing of the 2010 term loan the repricing provided for the incurrence of a new senior secured loan the “2011 term loan” in an aggregate principal amount of 11250 million the proceeds of the 2011 term loan together with 876 million of cash on hand were used to repay the remaining 12126 million outstanding balance of the 2010 term loan in full the 2011 term loan matures in march 2017 the repricing decreased the interest rate applicable to the 2011 term loan from the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 325 with a leveragebased stepdown to libor plus 275 with a leveragebased stepdown and reduced the libor floor applicable to the 2011 term loan from 150 to 100 we incurred 61 million in fees associated with the repricing which are reflected in “other expense income” on the company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2011

the following table shows operating expenses by each of the categories 

 

 compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and have typically represented approximately 60 of our total operating expenses these costs generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting increased compensation and benefits expenses for current staff and increased staffing levels continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefit expenses as of december 31 2011 the number of employees increased by 352 to 2429 from 2077 on november 30 2010 during the year ended december 31 2011 we continued to manage the compensation and benefits expenses through the hiring of staff in emerging market centers as of december 31 2011 approximately 392 of our employees were located in emerging market centers

we believe that domestic cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter in addition we expect existing foreign cash flows from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities was 2550 million and 1834 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively the 716 million yearoveryear increase primarily reflects increased net income resulting from the fullyear impact on earnings of the acquisitions made during the year ended november 30 2010 in the year ended december 31 2011 cash provided by operating activities was 432 million for the one month ended december 31 2010

cash used in investing activities was 906 million and 8923 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively the 8017 million increase in cash used in investing activities primarily reflects cash used to make acquisitions in the year ended november 30 2010 whereas no acquisitions were made during the year ended december 31 2011 additionally during the year ended november 30 2010 the proceeds from the maturation of shortterm investments were used to pay off the 2007 credit facility and fund the closing of the riskmetrics acquisition rather than being reinvested capital expenditures increased 99 million during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended november 30 2010 as we built out and consolidated our information technology infrastructure cash used in investing activities was 07 million for the one month ended december 31 2010

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 200913 “ revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements ” or asu 200913 asu 200913 addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting the adoption of asu 200913 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200914 “ software topic 985 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements ” or asu 200914 asu 200914 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude a nonsoftware components of tangible products and b software components of tangible products that are sold licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and nonsoftware components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality the adoption of asu 200914 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201028 “ intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 ” or asu 201028 this asu amends asc topic 350 asu 201028 clarifies the requirement to test for impairment of goodwill asc topic 350 has required that goodwill be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value under asu 201028 when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative an entity must assume that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and calculate the amount of that impairment the modifications to asc topic 350 resulting from the issuance of asu 201028 were effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and interim periods within those years the adoption of asu 201028 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201029 “business combinations topic 805—disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations” or asu 201029 this standard update clarifies that when presenting comparative financial statements sec registrants should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the current period business combinations had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings asu 201029 was effective prospectively for material either on an individual or aggregate basis business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2010 the adoption of asu 201029 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 “fair value measurements topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss” or asu 201104 asu 201104 changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” asu 201104 also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level 3 inputs this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not materially change our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 “presentation of comprehensive income ” or asu 201105 the issuance of asu 201105 is intended to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income the guidance in asu 201105 supersedes the presentation options in asc topic 220 and facilitates convergence of us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and requiring that all nonowner changes in shareholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201112 “ comprehensive income topic 220 ” or asu 201112 in asu 201112 the fasb decided that the specific requirement under asu 201105 to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred indefinitely therefore those requirements will not be effective for public entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 the remaining provisions covered by asu 201105 are effective for interim periods and years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the adoption of asu 201105 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 “testing goodwill for impairment” or asu 201108 which amends the guidance in asc subtopic 35020 “intangibles—goodwill and other—goodwill” under asu 201108 entities have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on qualitative factors to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit entities are then required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test asu 201108 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption is permitted including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september 15 2011 if an entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued we adopted asu 201108 during the quarter ended september 30 2011 the adoption of asu 201108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as no impairment of our goodwill was recognized 

 

 foreign currency risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating expense income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 156 and 160 of operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us 

  

under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 approximately 134 and 128 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended december 31 2011 606 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 219 were in japanese yen and 99 were in british pounds for the year ended november 30 2010 559 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 282 were in japanese yen and 103 were in british pounds 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 341 and 342 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2011 and november 30 2010 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds swiss francs hong kong dollars euros hungarian forints indian rupees mexican pesos and japanese yen expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency a gain or loss results from the change in value of the functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange gains of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and foreign exchange losses of 30 million and 04 million for the years ended november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively the gains on foreign currency exchange in the year ended december 31 2011 were primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar as compared to the japanese yen in the fiscal year we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 2522 million and 2694 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively these amounts were held primarily in checking and money market accounts in the countries where we maintain banking relationships the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes at december 31 2011 and 2010 we had invested 1405 million and 728 million respectively in debt securities with maturity dates ranging from 91 to 360 days from the date of purchase we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates declines in interest rates however will reduce future interest income 

borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of the greater of the london interbank offered rate or 100 and a margin of 275 which margin will be subject to adjustment based on our leverage ratio 

the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which will be amortized through august 2013 the swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under asc subtopic 81510 changes in libor will affect the interest rate on the portion of our credit facilities which have not been hedged by the interest rate swaps and therefore our costs under the credit facilities assuming an average of 6618 million of variable rate debt outstanding a hypothetical 142 basis point increase in libor for a one year period would result in approximately 66 million of additional interest rate expense 

we recorded a pretax loss in other comprehensive income of 24 million 15 million after tax for the year ended december 31 2011 as a result of the fair value measurement of these swaps the fair value of these swaps is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index and analytics products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data as of november 30 2010 throughout our businesses we utilized in a variety of ways certain data provided to us by over 190 data sources including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges many of these data suppliers compete with one another and in some cases with us for example iss relies on a data feed agreement with broadridge financial solutions which allows for a large number of proxy ballots to be received and proxy votes to be processed electronically minimizing the manual aspects of the proxy voting process and limiting the risk of error inherent in manual processes if the data feed agreement with broadridge was terminated we would have to incur significant expenses in order to input our clients’ voting instructions directly into broadridge’s proprietary electronic voting systems and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected since iss also competes with broadridge in some markets with respect to providing certain aspects of proxy voting services broadridge may have an incentive to not renew iss’ data feed agreement when its initial term expires in 2011 or to offer renewal terms which we may deem unreasonable from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us and some data suppliers including at least one stock exchange have terminated the provision of their data to us termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from providing broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers have sought and others may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

  

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products provide for the exchange of sensitive information with our clients through a variety of media including the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex system of internal processes and software controls to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of our internal controls unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of client data could occur such unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation could damage our reputation andor result in claims against us by our clients and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indices from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indices can affect the prices of constituent securities as well as products based on our indices our index clients rely on us to keep confidential material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have implemented information barrier procedures to limit access to this information and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail and we inadvertently disclose or an individual deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indices our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list exchange traded funds or other financial products based on our indices only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our indices if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our indices which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

any perceived conflicts of interest resulting from providing products and services to institutional investors in addition to proxy voting recommendations or providing products and services to corporations which are the subject of our proxy recommendations or other products and services could harm our reputation and business 

institutional clients of our governance business rely on iss to provide them with informed proxy vote recommendations benchmark proxy voting guidelines and unbiased analyses of companies’ environmental social and governance attributes the institutional clients of both our performance and risk and governance businesses particularly hedge funds and more active institutional investors may have material economic and other interests in the corporations on which iss provides proxy analyses and ratings or which are the subject of our financial research and analysis products and services in some cases these institutional clients pay us a significant amount of money for our performance and risk products and services and accordingly there may be a perception that we might advocate a particular position or provide research that supports a particular conclusion with respect to a corporation in order to satisfy the unique economic or other interests of a particular institutional client as a result institutional clients competitors and other market participants could raise questions about our ability to provide unbiased services which could harm our reputation 

  

through our iss corporate services subsidiary we provide products and services to corporate clients who use these services to learn about and improve their corporate governance practices accordingly there is a potential conflict of interest between the services we provide to institutional clients and the services including our compensation advisory services provided to clients of the iss corporate services subsidiary for example when we provide corporate governance services to a corporate client and at the same time provide proxy vote recommendations to institutional clients regarding that corporation’s proxy items there may be a perception that the iss team providing research to our institutional clients may treat that corporation more favorably due to its use of our services we have implemented an information barrier and other procedures designed to prevent any potential conflict of interest from impacting the ability of our research team to provide unbiased analyses 

the conflict management safeguards that we have implemented may not be adequate to manage these apparent conflicts of interest and clients or competitors may question the integrity of our services in the event that we fail to adequately manage perceived conflicts of interest we could incur reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and pending thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider many aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop and patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have in recent years increasingly pursued patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model or software application we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time such complaints are filed by or we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow we have made and expect to continue making expenditures related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

  

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages required to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us we may also be called upon to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure we monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to reengineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use resulting in increased software or data acquisition costs loss of rights andor costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide 

  

enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

to remain competitive and generate customer demand we must successfully develop new products and effectively manage transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industry in which we operate and the impact of technological change on our products we must continually introduce new products and services enhance existing products and services and effectively generate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services this requires accurate anticipation of clients’ changing needs and emerging investment trends we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate the revenues required to provide the desired results 

if among other things we fail to accurately anticipate and meet the needs of our clients through the successful development of new products and services if our new products and services are not attractive to our clients if our new products do not perform as well as anticipated or if the launch of new products and offering of new services is not timely we could lose market share and clients to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations also see “—if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

transitioning clients to enhanced products and services presents execution risks and challenges if we are unable to effectively manage transitions to new or enhanced products and services our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product in addition barriers to entry may be low in many cases including for singlepurpose product companies the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or equity indices financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients including those arising from the financial crisis may lead certain clients to seek products at a lower cost than what we provide these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income see “part i—item 1 business—our competition” above 

  

our business is dependent on the financial viability of our clients if our clients are negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets and are forced to shutdown or consolidate our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

most of our clients are in the financial services industry for example asset managers accounted for 524 and 666 of our revenues as of november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively the global financial crisis led to the closure or consolidation of a number of our clients including asset manager brokerdealer and hedge fund clients such events impacted our financial results including our run rates and aggregate and core retention rates in 2009 and 2010 and may continue to do so in the near term 

furthermore if such trends continue we may not be able to generate future growth and demand for our products may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of the global financial crisis the us congress undertook major financial reform which led to the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank act the doddfrank act will have a significant impact on many aspects of the way in which the financial services industry conducts business and will impose substantial new regulation on and regulatory oversight of a wide variety of financial services institutions the changes resulting from the doddfrank act will likely have a material impact on many of our clients and could negatively impact the business operations and financial viability of many of our clients which in turn could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

if our clients do not remain financially viable or if the negative conditions in the financial markets persist or worsen we may be forced to increase our provisions for bad debts which could adversely affect our profitability 

consolidation within our target markets may affect our business 

consolidation in the financial services industry could reduce our existing client base and the number of potential clients for example the recent global financial crisis led to the closure or merger of a number of our clients including brokerdealer asset manager and hedge fund clients if consolidation continues it may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth and may reduce demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant portion of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring portfolios to the extent our clients’ significantly deemphasize equity securities in their investment strategies the demand for equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets 

clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets these assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they were 160 162 and 167 of revenues for the years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 452 439 and 480 of the revenues from our ten largest clients in the fiscal years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively volatile capital markets such as those witnessed in 2009 and the second half of 2008 as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example as of november 30 2010 the monthend value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 3110 billion which was 328 higher than the value of such assets as of november 30 2009 and the value of such assets at november 30 2009 was 968 higher than the value of such assets as of november 30 2008 

  

a portion of our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our indices could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenues streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients our clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to try to decrease our fees correspondingly or otherwise lead to a reduction of our fees in certain cases for example competition is intense and increasing among our clients that provide exchange traded funds the fees they charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers additionally clients that have licensed our indices to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indices and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 274 273 and 286 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels or reduces its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal year ended november 30 2010 our largest client organization by revenue blackrock inc and affiliates “blackrock” accounted for 99 our total revenues for the fiscal year ended november 30 2010 approximately 829 of the revenue from blackrock came from fees based on the assets in blackrock’s exchange traded funds based on msci indices 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users or for a certain volume of products or services during that annual period for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term a disproportionately high percentage of contract value in the governance business comes up for renewal in december while we believe the annual recurring subscription model supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop internally certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth since we began operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth including in emerging market centers has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow internally or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting training and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “—risks related to the acquisition of riskmetrics group inc “ below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” 

  

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

a principal element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any future acquisitions could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected see “—risks related to the acquisition of riskmetrics group inc” below 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating expense income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 160 and 163 of operating revenues for the fiscal years ended november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

  

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the fiscal years ended november 30 2010 and 2009 approximately 128 and 123 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the fiscal year ended november 30 2010 559 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 282 were in japanese yen and 103 were in british pounds for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 462 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 394 were in japanese yen and 126 were in british pounds 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 342 and 350 of our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds swiss francs hong kong dollars hungarian forints euros indian rupees and japanese yen expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency a loss resulted from the devaluation of the value of the functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 30 million for the fiscal year ended november 30 2010 these losses on foreign currency exchange were primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar in the last six months of the fiscal year we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties some changes to the laws rules and regulations applicable to our clients could impact their demand for our products and services there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 we may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world in addition we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 

  

  

  

 we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products however these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

iss’ products and services support the proxy voting processes of clients consequently we may be exposed to potential liability claims brought by iss’ clients or third parties as a result of the operational failure of our products and services 

iss’ products and services support the proxy voting processes of clients if iss were to fail to provide the services provided for in its client contracts we could be required to provide credits to its clients and in some cases we may be subject to contractual penalties iss’ client agreements generally have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by its clients or other third parties based on the operational failure of its products and services however these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of management personnel financial and other resources 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in connection with our acquisition of riskmetrics on june 1 2010 we entered into a senior secured credit agreement which is comprised of i a 12750 million sixyear term loan facility and ii a 1000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility “new credit facility” see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” the new credit facility replaced our senior credit facility of 709 million and the senior secured facilities of riskmetrics of 2067 million outstanding as of may 31 2010 

as of november 30 2010 we had 12686 million of indebtedness under the new credit facility 560 million in current maturities and 12126 million in long term debt 2266 million of cash and cash equivalents and 739 million in shortterm investments during first quarter 2011 we will be required to make a payment under the excess cash flow provision of the new credit facility of approximately 560 million 

the new credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make or hold investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the new credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the new credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed a 40100 through february 28 2011 b 375100 from march 1 2011 through may 31 2011 c 350100 from june 1 2011 through august 31 2011 d 325100 from september 1 2011 through december 31 2011 and e 275100 thereafter and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the new credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be at least a 450100 through february 28 2011 and b 500100 thereafter on december 10 2010 our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from november 30 th to december 31 st  commencing with the twelvemonth period ended december 31 2011 the measurement periods for compliance with the financial ratios will be adjusted accordingly 

in addition our new credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

  

in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense because the new credit facility resulted in a substantial increase in our level of indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio following the completion of the acquisition in comparison to periods prior to the acquisition the potential for the occurrence of the consequences described in the preceding sentence could be increased compared to periods prior to the acquisition 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing operations information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee the loss of a group of our key professional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel additionally in connection with our ipo we issued founders grants to some of our employees and as these awards vest the final tranche representing 25 of the total award will vest in november 2011 their effectiveness as a retention tool diminishes if the equity incentive plans that we currently have in place do not adequately compensate our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error national disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the internet occur our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients may be materially and adversely affected 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where we or our clients are located and other events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events 

  

such events could also have a material adverse effect on our clients for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

we are subject to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability we have established and intend to further grow our presence in mexico the middle east asia africa eastern europe and central and south america in the last few years we have opened offices in budapest dubai monterrey mumbai and shanghai a significant number of our employees are located in offices outside of the united states and a number of those employees are located in emerging market centers in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our office and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

in order to penetrate markets outside of the united states we must provide a suite of products and services that fit the needs of the local market demand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world many countries have not fully developed laws and regulations regarding risk management and corporate governance and in many cases institutions in these countries have not developed widely accepted best practices regarding the same if we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and services outside of the united states there can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries 

we may incur unanticipated costs in connection with establishing and maintaining offices in emerging market locations 

our plans call for us to continue to increase the proportion of our employees in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 

  

although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

changes in the legislative regulatory and corporate environments in which iss’ clients operate may adversely impact our financial results 

iss’ historical growth has been due in large part to increased regulatory requirements highly visible corporate scandals increased shareholder activism and corporate chief executive officers and boards of directors that are increasingly concerned about and responsive to shareholder concerns to the extent that any of these trends change the demand for iss’ products and services could be reduced and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation to the extent these regulations change or are not extended to other markets our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 

our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our riskmetrics acquisition could be impaired as a result of future business conditions requiring us to record substantial writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

we have goodwill and intangible assets of 24229 million recorded on our balance sheet as of november 30 2010 we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions in general could result in future impairments of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in addition if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired 

we have engaged in hedging transaction and may engage in other hedging transactions which involve risks that could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

in july 2010 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk and to manage interest expense and we may engage in similar transactions in the future as of november 30 2010 the interest rate swaps had an aggregate notional principal amount of 4451 million and a fair value liability of 18 million our interest rate swaps effectively changed a portion of our variablerate debt obligations pursuant to our credit facilities to fixedrate debt obligations developing an effective strategy for movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition the counterparty to a derivate instrument could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk further we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or brokerage costs if a derivate instrument is terminated by us finally our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations as a result our economic hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the new york stock exchange for example the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial conditions and the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities see “—changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations” above 

in connection with our ipo and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our class a common stock the price of our class a common stock could decline 

the trading market for our class a common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for you 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our class a common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our class a common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock this would include sales of our common stock underlying restricted shares of class a common stock and options to purchase shares of class a common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plan 

as of november 30 2010 119522043 shares of our class a common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of november 30 2010 we had issued 2947305 and 66605 shares of class a common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 4257779 shares of msci class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to officers and certain employees of riskmetrics pursuant to the riskmetrics group inc 2000 stock option plan riskmetrics group inc 2004 stock option plan institutional shareholder services holdings inc equity incentive plan and riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan collectively the “rmg plans” as of november 30 2010 we had issued 1037836 shares of class a common stock under the rmg plans in june 2010 we also filed a registration statement assuming 3060090 shares available under the riskmetrics group inc 2007 omnibus incentive compensation plan 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our class a common stock 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our class a common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our class a common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of our company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your class a common stock in an acquisition 

we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth including growth through acquisitions the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements business conditions corporate law requirements and other factors 

risks related to the acquisition of riskmetrics group inc 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger which could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock 

the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business with riskmetrics’ business our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are not able to successfully combine our business with riskmetrics’ business within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or take longer to realize than expected we may not perform as expected and the price of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected 

it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated specifically issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of riskmetrics into our operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger so we perform as expected include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt our business 

our business relationships including client relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger 

parties with which we do business including clients and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with the merger including with respect to our current or future business relationships our business relationships may be subject to disruption as clients suppliers and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of the combined business 

  

our future results may suffer if we do not effectively manage riskmetrics’ risk management platform and riskmetrics’ other operations 

we plan to continue to work on combining riskmetrics’ risk management platform with our expertise in portfolio equity models and analytics to provide clients with the capability to understand risk across their entire investment processes our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this combination as well as riskmetrics’ other businesses including its corporate governance operation which poses challenges for management including challenges relating to the management and monitoring of new operations and the coordination of activities across a larger organization we cannot assure you that it will be successful or that we will realize expected operational efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancement and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other key employees as a result of the merger 

uncertainty about the success of the integration process and the effect of the merger on employees may have an adverse effect on the combined business this uncertainty may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business if key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration financial incentives or a desire not to continue as employees of the combined business we may have to incur significant costs in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees which could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

we will continue to incur restructuring and integrationrelated costs in connection with the merger 

we expect to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses resulting from the merger will be comprised of restructuring costs related to the elimination of overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs and the termination of overlapping vendor contracts we will also incur fees and costs related to the continued implementation of integration plans as of november 30 2010 we incurred 100 million of restructuring and integration related fees and expense we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset incremental restructuring and mergerrelated integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

the merger may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our class a common stock 

we currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to earnings per share during the first full calendar year after the merger this expectation is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change in addition future events and conditions could decrease or delay the accretion that is currently expected or could result in dilution including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger any dilution of or decrease or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of our common stock to decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those identified below and those discussed in “item 1a—risk factors” 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of investment decision support tools including indices portfolio risk and performance analytics and corporate governance products and services our products and services address multiple markets asset classes and geographies and are sold to a diverse client base including asset owners such as pension funds endowments foundations central banks family offices and insurance companies institutional and retail asset managers such as managers of pension assets mutual funds exchange traded funds “etfs” hedge funds and private wealth and financial intermediaries such as banks brokerdealers exchanges custodians investment consultants and corporate clients as of november 30 2010 we had approximately 5800 clients across 78 countries we had 33 offices in 19 countries to help serve our diverse client base with approximately 533 of our revenue from clients in the americas 324 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 143 in asia and australia based on revenues for the year ended november 30 2010 see “item 1 business—clients” above for an explanation of how we calculate our number of clients 

effective with the acquisition of riskmetrics group inc “riskmetrics” discussed below under “—strategic initiatives” the company consists of two industry leading businesses the performance and risk business and the governance business together these businesses offer what we believe is the most comprehensive suite of performance risk management and corporate governance products and services available in our industry see note 14 “segment information” for further information about msci’s operating segments 

our performance and risk business is a leading global provider of investment decision support tools including equity indices portfolio risk and performance analytics credit analytics and environmental social and governance “esg” products our performance and risk products are used in many areas of the investment process including portfolio construction and rebalancing performance benchmarking and attribution risk management and analysis indexlinked investment product creation asset allocation assessment of social responsibility and environmental stewardship and the effects of climate change on investments investment manager selection and investment research the flagship products within our performance and risk business are our global equity indices and esg products marketed under the msci brand our market and credit risk analytics marketed under the riskmetrics and barra brands our portfolio risk and performance analytics covering global equity and fixed income markets marketed under the barra brand and our valuation models and risk management software for the energy and commodities markets marketed under the fea brand 

our governance business is a leading provider of corporate governance and specialized financial research and analysis services to institutional investors and corporations around the world among other things the governance business facilitates the voting of proxies by institutional investors and provides indepth research and analysis to help inform voting decisions and identify issuerspecific risk the governance business offers both global security coverage and fully integrated products and services including proxy voting policy creation research vote recommendations vote execution postvote disclosure and reporting and analytical tools within a firewall designed to separate it from the rest of the governance business a unit of the governance business also provides products and services to corporate clients who may use those products and services to learn about and improve their governance practices the flagship products within our governance business are our governance research and outsourced proxy voting and reporting services marketed under the iss brand and our forensic accounting risk research legalregulatory risk assessment and due diligence products marketed under the cfra brand 

  

our governance business serves both institutional and corporate clients and we recognize that there is a potential for conflict of interest with respect to the provision of products and services to corporate issuers through iss corporate services and the products and services we provide to our institutional investor clients through institutional shareholders services “iss” we have instituted multiple safeguards to mitigate any real or perceived conflicts of interests we formed iss corporate services as a subsidiary with distinct resources and a firewall that prevents the flow of information outside of iss corporate services every iss corporate services contract indicates that the purchase of corporate services will not result in preferential treatment from iss and does not influence iss’ proxy recommendations or other research coverage recommendations and research coverage are based solely on the application of iss’ published policies and by an issuer’s actual governance policies and practices 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue growth for the company in total and by product category as well as operating profit growth and the level of profitability as measured by our operating margin our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our operating profits into excess cash in the future see “—liquidity and capital resources” below for a discussion of payments required to be made under the excess cash flow provision of the new credit facility defined below our revenue growth strategy includes among other things a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing product offerings including combining existing product features or data derived from our products to create new products and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings in furtherance of this revenue growth strategy we recently completed the acquisitions of riskmetrics and measurisk llc “measurisk” discussed below under “—strategic initiatives” 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we will continue to invest in and expand our operating functions and infrastructure including product management new sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world and additional staff and supporting technology for our research and our data operations and technology functions at the same time managing and controlling our operating expenses is very important to us and a distinct part of our culture over time our goal is to keep the rate of growth of our operating expenses below the rate of growth of our revenues allowing us to expand our operating margins however at times because of significant market opportunities it may be more important for us to invest in our business in order to support increased efforts to attract new clients and to develop new product offerings rather than emphasize shortterm operating margin expansion furthermore in some periods our operating expense growth may exceed our operating revenue growth due to the variability of revenues from several of our products including our equity indices licensed as the basis of etfs and nonrecurring fees 

change in fiscal year end 

on december 8 2010 the board of directors of the company approved a change in the company’s fiscal year end from november 30 to december 31 of each year this change to the calendar year reporting cycle began january 1 2011 as a result of the change the company will have a december 2010 fiscal month transition period the results of which will be separately reported in the company’s quarterly report on form 10q for the calendar quarter ending march 31 2011 and in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the calendar year ending december 31 2011 

strategic initiatives 

acquisition of riskmetrics 

on june 1 2010 we completed our acquisition of riskmetrics in a cashandstock transaction valued at approximately 15724 million in connection with the acquisition we entered into a senior secured credit agreement which is comprised of i a 12750 million sixyear term loan facility and ii a 1000 million five 

  

year revolving credit facility which includes a 250 million letter of credit subfacility and 100 million swingline loan subfacility the “new credit facility” see “—liquidity and capital resources” below for additional information 

for the year ended november 30 2009 we had total operating revenues of 4429 million and operating expenses of 2920 million for the year ended december 31 2009 riskmetrics had total operating revenues of 3034 million and operating expenses of 2364 million we assigned a significant value to the intangible assets of riskmetrics as part of the acquisition which increased and is expected to increase the amortization expense we recognized and we will recognize see note 10 “intangible assets” for further information we also have incurred increased interest expense as a result of the new credit facility we entered into in connection with the acquisition we therefore expect that the acquisition of riskmetrics will have a significant impact on our financial results in future periods additionally we may have additional exposure to foreign currency risk following the acquisition as a result of the subsequent change in the relative mix of our nonus dollar revenues and expenses 

acquisition of measurisk 

on july 30 2010 we acquired measurisk to expand our product offerings to hedge fund investors the value we assigned to the intangible assets of measurisk will further increase the amortization expense that we recognized during the year ended november 30 2010 and that we will recognize in the future see note 10 “intangible assets” for further information

our principal sales model in both of our business segments is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations often by a given number of users or for a certain volume of services for an annual fee paid up front additionally we have increasing recurring subscriptions to our managed services offering in which our staff oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients for the year ended november 30 2010 approximately 5378 million or 811 of our revenues was attributable to annual recurring subscriptions these fees are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized on our consolidated statement of income as the service is rendered additionally 1041 million of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs we derive revenues from certain institutional clients that use our indices as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indices as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades we also receive revenues from onetime fees related to implementation historical or customized reports advisory and consulting services and overages relating to the proxy research and voting services 

as a part of establishing the performance and risk and the governance operating segments and how they will be managed we have revised our product categories our revenues are now grouped into the following five product andor service categories 

index and esg 

this category includes subscription fees from msci equity index data and esg research and analytics products fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indices fees from nonrecurring licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from custom msci indices we also generate a limited amount of revenues based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indices 

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow 

  

our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indices also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client clients who utilize our esg research and analytics products and services pay an annual subscription fee and access these products and services via a web based application 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes investment inflows and outflows and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period 

risk management analytics products 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to our risk management analytics products including our two major products riskmanager and barraone we have increasing recurring subscriptions to our managed services offering in which our staff oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of our clients other products in this category include hedgeplatform intersight datametrics wealthbench couterparty risk and credit manager the products offer a consistent risk assessment framework for managing and monitoring investments in a variety of asset classes across an organization we are able to grow our revenues by licensing additional users and locations as well as sell additional products and services 

riskmanager is used by clients for daily analyzing measuring and monitoring of market risk at fund and firm level for sensitivity and stress testing and interactive whatif analysis riskmanager is a highly scalable platform accessed by clients via a license to a secure interactive webbased application service as a fully outsourced risk reporting service or as a web service in which a client’s systems access riskmetrics core risk elements by connecting directly to our systems 

barraone powered by the barra integrated model provides clients with global multiasset class risk analysis using barra fundamental factor technology the product is accessed by clients via a secure interactive webbased session web services or on an outsourced basis 

clients generally subscribe to the other products in this category on an annual recurring basis 

portfolio management analytics 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barra aegis and our proprietary risk data in barra aegis equity models direct products and our proprietary equity risk data incorporated in thirdparty software application offerings  eg  barra on vendors this category also includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to our fixed income portfolio analytics products 

barra aegis has many uses including portfolio risk analysis and forecasting optimization and factorbased portfolio performance attribution a base subscription for use in portfolio analysis typically involves a subscription to barra aegis and various risk data modules a client may add portfolio performance attribution optimization tools process automation tools or other features to its barra aegis subscription by licensing the client to receive additional software modules and risk data or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can increase our revenues per client further 

our equity models direct risk data is distributed directly to clients who then combine it with their own software applications or upload the risk data onto thirdparty applications a base subscription to our equity 

  

models direct product provides equity risk data for a set fee that authorizes one to two users by licensing the client to receive equity risk model data for additional countries or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can further increase our revenues per client 

the barra on vendors product makes our proprietary risk data from our equity models direct product available to clients via third party providers such as factset research systems inc 

the barra cosmos system for fixed income portfolio analytics products enables global fixed income portfolio managers to manage risk and optimize return in a multicurrency global bond portfolio this product is a desktop application 

energy and commodity analytics 

our energy and commodity analytics products consist of software applications which help users value and model physical assets and derivatives across a number of market segments including energy and commodity assets 

governance 

our governance products consist of corporate governance products and services including proxy research recommendation and voting services for asset owners and asset managers as well as governance advisory and compensation services for corporations it also includes forensic accounting research as well as class action monitoring and claims filing services to aid institutional investors in the recovery of funds from securities the products were all acquired as part of the riskmetrics acquisition the substantial majority of the revenues are annual subscription based revenues the largest portion of our nonrecurring revenues are included in this category as a result of advisory and consulting services and overages relating to the proxy research and voting services 

the performance and risk business is comprised of index and esg risk management analytics portfolio management analytics and energy  commodity analytics products the governance business is comprised of the governance products 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of our total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as our “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking fees for the next 12 months from all subscriptions and investment product licenses we currently provide to our clients under renewable contracts assuming all contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects an annualization of the most recent periodic fee earned under such license the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and we have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future fees there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the following table set forth our run rates and the percentage growth over the periods indicated run rates have been adjusted to conform to the product categorization used for accounting revenues in order to provide a more meaningful comparison the historical numbers have been adjusted to include riskmetrics as if the acquisition had occurred on november 30 2008 

 

  

 changes in run rate between periods reflect increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indices the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indices price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

  

the following table sets forth our net new recurring subscription sales as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of the dates indicated for the years ended 

 

 retention rates 

other key metrics are our “aggregate retention rate” and “core retention rate” which are collectively referred to as “retention rates” these metrics are important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our core retention rate is calculated in the same way as our aggregate retention rate except that the core retention rate does not treat switches between products as a cancellation our aggregate and core retention rates are computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate or core retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indices or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indices aggregate and core retention rates for a nonannual period reflect the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

  

the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of the dates indicated 

 

 the following table sets forth our core retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 as if we had completed the riskmetrics acquisition as of the dates indicated 

 

   

the quarterly retention rates are calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded cancellations of 255 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 255 million to derive 1021 million of annualized cancellations this 1021 million was then divided by the 6613 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year adjusted for the measurisk acquisition to derive a cancellation rate of 154 the 154 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 846 for the fourth quarter 

for the calculation of the core retention rate the same methodology was used except the amount of cancellations in the quarter was reduced by the amount of product swaps for example in fourth quarter 2010 we had product swaps of 08 million which was subtracted from the 255 million of actual cancels to derive core cancels of 247 million this 247 million was annualized to derive 990 million of annualized cancellations which was then divided by the 6613 million subscription run rate at the beginning of the year adjusted for the measurisk acquisition to derive a cancellation rate of 150 the 150 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive the core retention rate of 850 for the fourth quarter 

retention rates for the year ended november 30 2010 remained lower than prefinancial crisis peaks due to the recent adverse financial environment and increased competition which resulted in liquidations and consolidations price pressures and declines in demand for discretionary financial research products for the year ended november 30 2010 302 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter historically retention rates have generally been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 

expenses 

compensation and benefits costs represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and typically have represented approximately 50 to 60 of our total operating expenses these costs generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting existing staff compensation and benefit increases and increased staffing levels employing individuals in our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefit costs as of november 30 2010 we had approximately 2077 employees throughout the world of which approximately 300 were located in emerging market centers 

we group our operating expenses into five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 in both the cost of services and sga expense categories compensation and benefits represents the majority of our expenses other costs associated with the number of employees such as office space are included in both the cost of services and sga expense categories consistent with the allocation of employees to those respective areas 

  

cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data operations and technology software engineering product management and proxy research and voting functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits occupancy market data fees proxy voting fees information technology and other miscellaneous costs prior to may 22 2009 a portion of these costs were allocated to us by morgan stanley which was the controlling shareholder through that date the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

selling general and administrative 

this category includes compensation and benefits costs for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses were for occupancy third party consulting costs and information technology prior to may 22 2009 a portion of these costs were allocated to us by morgan stanley 

restructuring 

during the year ended november 30 2010 msci’s management approved committed to and initiated a plan to restructure the company’s operations due to its acquisition of riskmetrics restructuring includes expenses associated with the elimination of overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs the termination of overlapping vendor contracts and the discontinuance of the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangibles expense relates to the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 riskmetrics in june 2010 and measurisk in july 2010 our intangible assets consist primarily of technology and software trademarks client relationships and noncompetition agreements the intangible assets have useful lives ranging from one to 20 years 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets 

other expense income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our credit facilities interest we collect on cash and shortterm investments foreign currency gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information 

  

available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition research and development and software capitalization allowance for doubtful accounts tax contingencies impairment of longlived assets and accrued compensation if different assumptions or conditions were to be utilized the results could be materially different from our reported results 

revenue recognition 

revenue related to our nonsoftwarerelated recurring arrangements is recognized pursuant to the requirements of financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 60525 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” under the provisions of asc subtopic 60525 transactions with multiple elements should be considered separate units of accounting if all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

 we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for nonsoftwarerelated products include provisions that among other things allow clients for no additional fee to receive updates and modifications that may be made from time to time for the term of the agreement typically one year as we currently do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element of the transaction we do not account for the delivered item as a separate element accordingly we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our softwarerelated recurring revenue arrangements do not require significant modification or customization of any underlying software applications being licensed accordingly we recognize software revenues excluding the energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products pursuant to the requirements of asc subtopic 985605 “ softwarerevenue recognition ” in accordance with asc subtopic 985605 we begin to recognize revenues from subscriptions maintenance and client technical support and professional services when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence of a legally binding arrangement 2 delivery has occurred 3 client fee is deemed fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for software products include provisions that among other things would allow clients to receive unspecified future software upgrades for no additional fee as well as the right to use the software products with maintenance for the term of the agreement typically one year as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” for these elements except for the support related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we do not account for these elements separately accordingly except for revenues related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our software license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions such provisions generally allow a client to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision we do not record subscription revenues until the earlier of the receipt of a written client acceptance or if not notified by the client that it is cancelling the license agreement the expiration of the acceptance period 

  

for our energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value if all undelivered elements exist in virtually all of our contracts the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support the fair value of support is determined based upon what the fees for the support are for clients who purchase support separately under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue support fees for these products are recognized ratably over the support period 

we apply sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” “ revenue recognition ” in determining revenue recognition related to clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets under management or contract volumes these fees are calculated based upon estimated assets in the investment product or contract volumes obtained either through independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information of the client 

we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

 we have signed contracts with all clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated these fees are billed in arrears after the fees have been earned the fees are earned as we supply the indices to the client we assess the creditworthiness of these clients prior to entering into a contract and regularly review the receivable balances related to them 

research and development and software capitalization 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including asc subtopic 73010 “ research and development ” and asc subtopic 985730 “softwareresearch and development ” asc subtopic 73010 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred asc subtopic 985730 specifies that costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material and accordingly we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred research and development costs for the years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 were approximately 732 million 533 million and 565 million respectively 

sharebased compensation 

certain of our employees have received sharebased compensation under certain compensation programs our compensation expense reflects the fair value method of accounting for sharebased payments under asc subtopic 71810 “ compensationstock compensation ” asc subtopic 71810 requires measurement of compensation cost for equitybased awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period net of estimated forfeitures the fair value of msci restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the grant date fair value of msci common stock measured as the closing price on the date of grant the fair value of msci stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model 

  

and the single grant life method under the single grant life method option awards with graded vesting are valued using a single weightedaverage expected option life compensation for all stockbased payment awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method msci reserved approximately 43 million class a common shares for outstanding vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock awards assumed as part of the acquisition of riskmetrics on june 1 2010 the fair values of stock options assumed were estimated using a hullwhite lattice optionpricing model the hullwhite model is commonly used for estimating the fair value of inthemoney and outofthemoney options as it explicitly models the exercise behavior of option holders considering the amount by which each such grant is in or outofthemoney the major assumptions utilized are the stock price the remaining contractual term the remaining time to vest forfeiture behavior dividend yield the riskfree interest rate expected volatility and the early exercise multiple 

based on interpretive guidance related to stock compensation our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of sharebased awards that were granted to retirementeligible employees over the course of the current year rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when it is probable and estimable that a receivable will not be collected the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately 10 million at november 30 2010 08 million at november 30 2009 and 07 million at november 30 2008 changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts from november 30 2008 to november 30 2010 were as follows 

 

  

 tax contingencies 

prior to may 2 2008 we were a member of the morgan stanley consolidated group and our taxable income was included in the consolidated us federal income tax return of morgan stanley as well as in returns filed by morgan stanley with certain state and local taxing jurisdictions after may 2 2008 upon the disposition by morgan stanley of a portion of its equity interest in us we were no longer eligible to join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with morgan stanley we have filed and will continue to file our consolidated us federal income tax return as a taxable group separate from morgan stanley our foreign income tax returns have been filed on a separate company basis our federal and foreign income tax liability has been computed and presented in the consolidated financial statements as if we were a separate taxpaying entity in the periods presented the state and local liability presented in these statements reflects the fact that we are included in certain filings of morgan stanley through may 22 2009 the date on which morgan stanley disposed of its remaining equity interest in us and that our tax liability is affected by the attributions of the morgan stanley group we continued to file certain state income tax returns with morgan stanley on a consolidated 

  

combined or unitary basis under applicable state law through may 22 2009 after may 22 2009 we were no longer eligible for inclusion in any state or local consolidated combined or unitary return filed by morgan stanley and from that date forward we have been filing the relevant state income tax returns as a separate taxable group 

although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed in this annual report on form 10k are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we are required to file income tax returns we have recorded additional tax expense related to open tax years which we believe is adequate in relation to the potential for assessments these amounts have been recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition we believe the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition however to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves a resolution could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded as part of our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired the carrying amount of our goodwill is 17067 million primarily relating to the acquisitions of barra riskmetrics and measurisk the goodwill is not amortized but rather is subject to an impairment test each year or more often if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred pursuant to asc topic 350 “ goodwill and other intangible ” for the years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 goodwill impairment was determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its book value if the estimated fair value exceeds the book value goodwill is not deemed to be impaired if the estimated fair value is below book value however further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment as the acquisitions of riskmetrics and measurisk occurred during the year ended november 30 2010 no impairment test was performed related to the goodwill associated with these acquisitions the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the book value in the years ended november 30 2010 2009 and 2008 and as a result no impairment of the goodwill was recorded 

intangible assets 

intangible assets consist of those definitelived intangibles from the acquisitions of barra in june 2004 riskmetrics in june 2010 and measurisk in july 2010 the company amortizes definitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when impairment indicators are present and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented the company has no indefinitelived intangibles the intangible assets have useful lives ranging from one to 20 years 

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued nonstock based compensation and benefits expenses a significant portion of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary each year end we determine the amount of discretionary cash bonus pools we also review compensation and benefits expenses throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations we take these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate changes to these factors could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of expense that we report in a particular period accrued non stockbased compensation and related benefits as of november 30 2010 was 934 million 

  

factors affecting the comparability of results 

the results of riskmetrics and measurisk were not included in our results of operations until their acquisition dates of june 1 2010 and july 30 2010 respectively the riskmetrics acquisition has had a significant impact on our results of operations and will affect the comparability of our results in the future 

restructuring 

in connection with the acquisition of riskmetrics we initiated a plan to restructure the company’s operations to eliminate overlapping positions and duplicative occupancy costs terminate overlapping vendor contracts and discontinue the planned integration of a product into riskmetrics’ standard product offering suite we initiated restructuring activities during the third quarter of 2010 and expect the elimination of overlapping positions to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2011 and the elimination of leases or vendor contracts is anticipated to be completed over the next 13 months see “—restructuring” below for information on restructuringrelated activities and estimated costs 

the cumulative charges that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ significantly we may also incur other charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of or associated with the restructuring 

results of operations 

year ended november 30 2010 compared to year ended november 30 2009 

 

   

operating revenues 

 

 total operating revenues for the year ended november 30 2010 increased 2200 million or 497 to 6629 million compared to 4429 million for the year ended november 30 2009 approximately 1567 million of the growth was comprised of revenues contributed by the acquisitions made during the year ended november 30 2010 the remaining 632 million of growth was comprised of increases in asset based fees and subscription revenues of 338 million and 294 million respectively subscription revenues consist of our revenues related to index and esg subscriptions risk management analytics portfolio management analytics energy and commodity analytics and governance products our revenues are impacted by changes in exchange rates primarily as they relate to the us dollar had the us dollar not strengthened relative to exchange rates at the beginning of the year our revenues for the year ended november 30 2010 would have been higher by 86 million 

our index and esg products primarily consist of equity index subscriptions equity index asset based fees products and esg products revenues related to index and esg products increased 699 million or 268 to 3304 million for the year ended november 30 2010 compared to 2605 million in the same period in 2009 

revenues from the index and esg subscriptions subcategory were up 361 million or 191 to 2246 million for the year ended november 30 2010 compared to 1885 million in the same period in 2009 approximately 93 million of the growth was comprised of revenues contributed by the acquisitions made during the year ended november 30 2010 the remaining 268 million was attributable to growth primarily in our core benchmark indices 

revenues attributable to the index asset based fees products subcategory increased 338 million or 470 to 1058 million for the year ended november 30 2010 compared to 720 million in the same period in 2009 the growth was primarily attributable to the growth in the average value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices the average value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices in the aggregate increased 587 to 2611 billion for the year ended november 30 2010 compared to 1646 billion for the year ended november 30 2009 as of november 30 2010 the value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 3110 billion representing an increase of 328 from 2342 billion as of november 30 2009 

the three msci indices with the largest amount of etf assets linked to them as of november 30 2010 were the msci emerging markets eafe and us broad market indices with 1027 billion 394 billion and 156 billion in assets respectively 

to conform to industry standards we have changed our etf assets under management calculation methodology from etf price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding to etf net asset value multiplied by the number of shares outstanding the cash inflowoutflow figures are based on the change in the shares 

  

outstanding between the periods the numbers in the tables are presented on this basis beginning with the february 2010 quarter periods prior to the february 2010 quarter have not been restated and are therefore not comparable the following table sets forth the value of assets in etfs linked to msci indices and the sequential change of such assets as of the periods indicated

cash flows from operating activities 

in the year ended november 30 2010 net cash provided by operating activities increased 400 to 1834 million from 1309 million in the same period in 2009 the change primarily reflects higher net income adjusted for noncash items and decreased cash paid for taxes and to related parties partially offset by the increase in trade receivables 

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for payment of cash compensation expenses office rent market data technology costs interest and taxes in the nearterm we expect to meet all interest and principal repayment obligations on outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility from cash generated by operations the payment of cash compensation expenses is historically at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were 8923 million for the year ended november 30 2010 compared to 3082 million for the year ended november 30 2009 the 5841 million change primarily reflects the cash outflows to complete our acquisitions of riskmetrics and measurisk offset in part by the decreased purchases and increased proceeds from the maturity of shortterm investments during the year ended november 30 2010

 foreign currency risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating expense income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 160 and 163 of operating revenues for the years ended november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the years ended november 30 2010 and 2009 approximately 128 and 123 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the year ended november 30 2010 559 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 282 were in japanese yen and 103 were in british pounds for the year ended november 30 2009 462 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 394 were in japanese yen and 126 were in british pounds 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 342 and 350 of our operating expenses for the years ended november 30 2010 and 2009 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in british pounds swiss francs hong kong dollars hungarian forints euros indian rupees and japanese yen expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency a loss resulted from the devaluation of the value of the functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 30 million for the year ended november 30 2010 these losses on foreign currency exchange were primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar in the last six months of the fiscal year we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 2266 million at november 30 2010 and 1760 million at november 30 2009 these amounts were held primarily in checking and money market accounts in 

  

the countries where we maintain banking relationships the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes at november 30 2010 and 2009 we had invested 739 million and 2953 million respectively in debt securities with maturity dates ranging from 91 to 365 days from the date of purchase we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates declines in interest rates however will reduce future interest income 

borrowings under the new credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of the greater of the london interbank offered rate and 150 and a margin of 325 which margin will be subject to adjustment based on our leverage ratio 

on july 21 2010 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional principal amount of 4463 million “new swap agreements” amortizing through august 2013 the new swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under asc subtopic 81510 the effective fixed rate on the aggregate notional principal amount swapped of 4451 million on november 30 2010 was 512 

changes in libor will affect the interest rate on the portion of our credit facilities which have not been hedged by the interest rate swaps and therefore our costs under the new credit facility assuming an average of 8246 million of variable rate debt outstanding a hypothetical 221 basis point increase in libor for a one year period would result in approximately 82 million of additional interest rate expense 

we recorded a pretax loss in other comprehensive income of 36 million 22 million after tax for the year ended november 30 2010 as a result of the fair value measurement of these swaps the fair value of these swaps is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index and analytics products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data as of november 30 2009 we utilized and distributed certain data provided to us by over 235 data sources including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world if the products of our suppliers have errors are delayed have design defects are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges many of these data suppliers compete with one another and to some extent with us from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers 

  

including stock exchanges threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts would hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

some of our thirdparty suppliers also are our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products exchange information with clients through a variety of media including the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex network of internal process and software controls to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in implementation of our internal controls misappropriation of client data could occur such internal control inadequacies could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indices from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indices can affect the prices of constituent securities and products based on our indices our index clients rely on us to keep material nonpublic information about changes to the future composition of an index confidential and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have implemented information barrier procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding material nonpublic changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail and we inadvertently disclose or an individual deliberately misuses material nonpublic information about a change to one of our indices our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list exchange traded funds or other financial products based on our indices only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our indices if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our indices which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and pending thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider certain aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have in recent years increasingly pursued patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on a relevant index methodology risk model or software application we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow we have made and expect to continue making expenditures related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages required to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us we may also be called upon to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure we monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source 

  

code modules to reengineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use resulting in our loss of rights or costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us the realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on the financial viability of our clients if our clients are negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets and are forced to shutdown or consolidate our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

most of our clients are in the financial services industry for example asset managers accounted for 666 and 676 of our revenues as of november 30 2009 and 2008 respectively the recent global financial crisis led to the closure or consolidation of a number of our clients including asset manager brokerdealer and hedge fund clients such events impacted our financial results including our run rates and aggregate and core retention rates in 2009 and may continue to do so in the near term 

  

furthermore if such trends continue we may not be able to generate future growth and demand for our products may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our clients do not remain financially viable or if the negative conditions in the financial markets persist or worsen we may be forced to increase our provisions for bad debts which could adversely affect our profitability 

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the majority of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios to the extent our clients’ investment emphasis significantly changes from equity to fixed income securities or multiasset class or derivative strategies the demand for equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets 

clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets these assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they were 163 169 and 186 of revenues for the years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 439 480 and 515 of the revenues from our ten largest clients in the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively economic uncertainty and volatile capital markets such as those witnessed in 2009 and the second half of 2008 as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example as of november 30 2009 the monthend value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 2342 billion which was 968 higher than the value of such assets as of november 30 2008 but the value of such assets at november 30 2008 was 379 lower than the value of such assets as of november 30 2007 the increase compared to november 30 2008 was comprised of net asset appreciation of 667 billion and 485 billion in net asset inflows continuing economic uncertainty could result in the fluctuation of or declines in our assetbased fees which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation within our target markets may affect our business 

consolidation in the financial services industry could reduce our existing client base and the number of potential clients for example the recent global financial crisis led to the closure or merger of a number of our clients including brokerdealer asset manager and hedge fund clients if consolidation continues it may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth and may reduce demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our indices could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenues are concentrated in some of our largest clients our clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to try to decrease our fees accordingly for example competition is intense and increasing among our clients that provide exchange traded funds the fees they charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers additionally clients that have licensed our indices to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indices and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments 

the market for our products is characterized by shifting client demands evolving market practices and for some of our products rapid technological change changed client demands new market practices or new technologies can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and respond to technological and market changes we may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing our new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 273 286 and 308 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 our largest client organization by revenue barclays plc and affiliates accounted for 99 110 and 126 of our total revenues respectively for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 approximately 875 of the revenue from barclays came from fees based on the assets in barclays’ exchange traded funds based on msci indices 

in december 2009 blackrock inc and barclays plc announced the completion of the merger between blackrock inc and barclays global investors which includes the ishares exchange traded funds business if we combined our revenues from blackrock inc with our revenues from the fees attributable to the businesses acquired by blackrock inc blackrock inc would have represented 106 of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users for most of our products our clients may cancel their 

  

subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe this practice supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop independently certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry to create a singlepurpose product may be low in many cases the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or equity indices these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth over our operating history there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth including in emerging market centers has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow internally or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting training and retaining additional qualified personnel including additional managers expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” 

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

a principal element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any future acquisitions could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

  

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating expense income 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 163 and 169 of operating revenues for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 and 2008 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros british pounds japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 and 2008 approximately 123 and 141 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 462 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 394 were in japanese yen and 126 were in british pounds for the fiscal year ended november 30 2008 463 of our foreign currency revenues were in euros 302 were in japanese yen and 205 were in british pounds 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 350 and 275 of our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 and 2008 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in swiss francs british pounds hong kong dollars euros japanese yen indian rupee and hungarian forint expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency a loss resulted from the devaluation of the value of the functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 04 million for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 these losses on foreign currency exchange were primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

   

  

  

 we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products however these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our 

  

management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

on november 14 2007 we entered into the 5000 million credit facility see “item 1—business—the separation of msci from morgan stanley—credit facility” and “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” as of november 30 2009 we had 3805 million of indebtedness under the credit facility 3382 million in long term debt and 423 million in current maturities cash and cash equivalents of 1760 million and 2953 million in shortterm investments 

the credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make or hold investments make acquisitions merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis except as described in “item 1—business—the separation of msci from morgan stanley” and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed a 37510 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 32510 thereafter and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be a 30010 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 40010 thereafter 

in addition our credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense 

  

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are dependent upon any individual employee the loss of a group of our key professional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel additionally in connection with our ipo we issued founders grants to some of our employees and as these awards vest their effectiveness as a retention tool diminishes if the equity incentive plans that we currently have in place do not adequately compensate our key employees or are not competitive we may lose key personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error national disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the internet occur our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients may be materially and adversely affected 

certain events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where we or our clients are located and other events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity plans that we have sufficiently cover or reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events 

such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity plans will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these plans will be accurate 

  

we are subject to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability we have established and intend to further grow our presence in the middle east asia africa eastern europe and latin america in the last few years we have opened offices in budapest dubai monterrey mumbai and shanghai as of november 30 2009 431 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 280 as of november 30 2008 in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

we may incur unanticipated costs in connection with establishing and maintaining offices in emerging market locations 

our plans call for us to continue to increase the proportion of our employees in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a global corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 

although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

we are also subject to nonincome taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities 

risks related to our separation from morgan stanley 

our historical financial results for the periods before our separation from morgan stanley are derived from our results as a subsidiary of morgan stanley and include allocated costs for functions historically provided by morgan stanley and therefore may not be representative of our results as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical financial information for the periods before our separation from morgan stanley do not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during those periods and may not be indicative of the results we will achieve over time as a standalone public company the historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by morgan stanley including portions 

  

of human resources information technology accounting legal and compliance tax office space leasing corporate services and treasury these allocations were based on what we and morgan stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in support of our business the historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations financial condition cash flows or costs and expenses will be over time for additional information see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “item 6—selected consolidated financial data” and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

since the completion of our ipo in november 2007 we have established our own financial administrative and other support functions including such functions that replace those services historically provided by morgan stanley and we cannot assure you that over time we will be able to operate our business as effectively or cost efficiently as morgan stanley 

prior to our separation from morgan stanley we relied on certain financial administrative and other resources of morgan stanley to operate our business both domestically and internationally we completed our ipo in november 2007 and as a result of our ipo we began enhancing certain financial legal and compliance administrative information technology and other support systems and processes or contracting with third parties to replace morgan stanley’s systems in addition to replacing morgan stanley systems we also created additional systems and processes in may 2009 morgan stanley sold its remaining equity interest in us and we began operating as a standalone company 

for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 expenses related to services provided by morgan stanley personnel were 17 million 183 million and 264 million respectively as of may 22 2009 morgan stanley no longer provided corporate functions for us and no additional expense allocations have been recorded by us since that date 

the systems and processes we have created or obtained to replace those provided by morgan stanley have been established within the last few years and may not be sufficient to meet our needs any failure or significant downturn in our financial or administrative policies and systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting all of the procedures and practices required as a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley were previously established but we have established additional procedures and practices as a standalone public company as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur we have made and will continue to make changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a standalone public company 

in connection with our ipo and separation from morgan stanley we entered into agreements with morgan stanley where we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with morgan stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant see “item 1—business—the separation of msci from morgan stanley” 

  

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our class a common stock the price of our class a common stock could decline 

the trading market for our class a common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for you 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our class a common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our class a common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock this would include sales of our common stock 

  

underlying restricted shares of class a common stock and options to purchase shares of class a common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plan 

as of november 30 2009 104781404 shares of our class a common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of november 30 2009 we had issued 1548403 and 48517 shares of class a common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our class a common stock 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our class a common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our class a common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of our company thereby reducing the likelihood that a premium would be paid for your class a common stock in an acquisition 

  

we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth including growth through acquisitions the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements business conditions corporate law requirements and other factors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those identified below and those discussed in “item 1a—risk factors” 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of investment decision support tools including indices and portfolio risk and performance analytics for use by institutions in managing equity fixed income and multiasset class portfolios our flagship products are our global equity indices marketed under the msci brand and our equity portfolio analytics marketed under the barra brand our products are used in many areas of the investment process including portfolio construction and optimization performance benchmarking and attribution risk management and analysis indexlinked investment product creation asset allocation investment manager selection and investment research 

our clients include asset owners such as pension funds endowments foundations central banks and insurance companies institutional and retail asset managers such as managers of pension assets mutual funds exchange traded funds “etfs” hedge funds and private wealth and financial intermediaries such as brokerdealers exchanges custodians and investment consultants as of november 30 2009 we had over 3100 clients across 67 countries we had 21 offices in 15 countries to help serve our diverse client base with approximately 514 of our revenue from clients in the americas 316 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” 94 in japan and 76 in asiapacific not including japan based on the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 revenues 

our principal sales model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at specified locations by a given number of users for an annual fee paid up front the substantial majority of our revenues come from these annual recurring subscriptions over time as their needs evolve our clients often add product modules users and locations to their subscriptions which results in an increase in our revenues per client additionally a significant source of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs we also derive revenues from certain institutional clients that use our indices as the basis for passively managed retail and institutional indexed funds and separate accounts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets we also generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indices as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue growth for the company in total and by product category as well as operating profit growth and the level of profitability as measured by our operating margin our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our operating profits into excess cash in the future we expect to use this cash to make investments in our business both internally and externally through acquisitions in order to capitalize on the many growth opportunities before us and to expand our market position our revenue growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing equity product offerings as well as further developing and growing our investment tools for multiasset class investment institutions and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we will continue to invest in and expand our operating functions and infrastructure including new sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world and additional staff and supporting technology for our research and our data 

  

operations and technology functions and our general and administrative functions at the same time managing and controlling our operating expenses is very important to us and a distinct part of our culture over time our goal is to keep the rate of growth of our operating expenses below the rate of growth of our revenues allowing us to expand our operating margins however at times because of significant market opportunities it may be more important for us to invest in our business in order to support increased efforts to attract new clients and to develop new product offerings rather than emphasize shortterm operating margin expansion furthermore in some periods our operating expense growth may exceed our operating revenue growth due to the variability of revenues from several of our products including our equity indices licensed as the basis of etfs 

business environment 

beginning in the second half of 2008 various sectors of the global financial market were adversely affected by a market environment that included illiquidity and widening credit spreads unprecedented market volatility and changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates investor participation levels and legal and regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements the conditions in the financial markets also began to impact our business particularly with respect to our equity index asset based fees due to declines in the value of assets in etfs linked to our products and our revenues from our equity portfolio analytics due to the closure of dedicated quant funds both standalone and within traditional asset managers and quantitative teams which support fundamental money managers 

for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 “fiscal year 2009” our revenues related to equity index asset based fees increased as the value of the assets in etfs linked to our products recovered from the relatively low balances experienced at the end of the fiscal year ended november 30 2008 “fiscal year 2008” and the first half of fiscal year 2009 asset inflows increased the number of new etfs linked to our products increased and we applied minimum fee provisions to certain of our etf licenses however because the vast majority of our revenues results from granting licenses to clients in the financial services industry including asset managers brokerdealers exchanges and other institutional clients many of whom have not recovered as quickly or strongly as the equity markets the performance of our subscription products remains under pressure most notably subscriptions to our equity portfolio analytics products 

we do not believe that our liquidity has been affected by the events in the global financial markets see “—liquidity and capital resources—cash flows” below 

key financial metrics and drivers 

revenues 

our principal sales model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at specified locations by a given number of client users for an annual fee paid upfront the substantial majority of our revenues come from these annual recurring subscriptions these fees are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized each month on our income statement as the service is rendered over time as their needs evolve our clients often add product modules users and locations to their subscriptions which results in an increase in our revenues per client additionally a significant source of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs passive mutual funds and structured products these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets 

we group our revenues into the following four product categories 

equity indices 

this category includes fees from msci equity index data subscriptions fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indices fees from nonrecurring licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from custom msci indices we also generate a limited amount of revenues from license fees for the use of our intellectual property based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indices 

  

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indices also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes investment inflows and outflows and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period 

equity portfolio analytics 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barra aegis and our proprietary risk data in barra aegis equity models direct products and our proprietary equity risk data incorporated in thirdparty software application offerings  eg  barra on vendors 

barra aegis has many uses including portfolio risk analysis and forecasting optimization and factorbased portfolio performance attribution a base subscription for use in portfolio analysis typically involves a subscription to barra aegis and various risk data modules a client may add portfolio performance attribution optimization tools process automation tools or other features to its barra aegis subscription by licensing the client to receive additional software modules and risk data or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can increase our revenues per client further 

our equity models direct risk data is distributed directly to clients who then combine it with their own software applications or upload the risk data onto thirdparty applications a base subscription to our equity models direct product provides equity risk data for a set fee that authorizes one to two users by licensing the client to receive equity risk model data for additional countries or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can further increase our revenues per client 

the barra on vendors product makes our proprietary risk data from our equity models direct product available to clients via third party providers such as factset research systems inc 

multiasset class portfolio analytics 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barraone and barra totalrisk together with our proprietary risk data for multiple asset classes currently we are actively selling subscriptions only to barraone and related risk data most of the features and functionality of totalrisk have been added to barraone and we are decommissioning totalrisk as this happens we will offer our totalrisk clients the opportunity to transition to barraone as this transition takes place revenues from this product group will increasingly come from barraone therefore we expect declines in revenues from totalrisk 

other products 

this category includes revenues from three types of products energy and commodity asset valuation analytics fixed income analytics and investable hedge fund indices the last remaining investable hedge fund indices license was terminated in fiscal year 2009 

  

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of our total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as our “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking fees for the next 12 months from all subscriptions and investment product licenses we currently provide to our clients under renewable contracts assuming all contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent exchange rates for any license where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects an annualization of the most recent periodic fee earned under such license the run rate does not include fees associated with nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal during the period and we have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable subscription or agreement even though such notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future fees there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the following table sets forth our run rate as of the dates indicated and the percentage growth over the prior period 

 

   

changes in run rate between periods reflect increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indices the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indices price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

the following table sets forth our net new recurring subscription sales for the fiscal years ended 

 

 retention rates 

because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues other key metrics are our “aggregate retention rate” and “core retention rate” which are collectively referred to as “retention rates” the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our core retention rate is calculated in the same way as our aggregate retention rate except that the core retention rate does not treat switches between products as a cancellation our aggregate and core retention rates are computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate or core retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indices or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indices aggregate and core retention rates for a nonannual period reflect the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

  

   

the following table sets forth our core retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

  

 the quarterly retention rates are calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded cancellations of 163 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 163 million to derive 652 million of annualized cancellations this 652 million was then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year of 3550 million to derive a cancellation rate of 184 the 184 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate of 816 for the fourth quarter 

for the calculation of the core retention rate the same methodology was used except the amount of cancellations in the quarter was reduced by the amount of product swaps for example in the fourth quarter 2009 we had product swaps of 10 million which was subtracted from the 163 million of actual cancels to derive core cancels of 153 million this 153 million was annualized to derive 610 million of annualized cancellations which was then divided by the beginning year run rate of 3550 million to derive a cancellation rate of 172 the 172 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive the core retention rate of 828 for the fourth quarter 

retention rates for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 remained depressed compared to prior years reflecting the closure or merger of a number of our clients and the shutdown of quantitative funds and teams during the year in the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 310 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter with the exception of the current year retention rates generally have been higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth fiscal quarter where on average 40 of our subscription cancellations have occurred 

  

our relationship with morgan stanley 

prior to may 22 2009 morgan stanley was our controlling shareholder on may 22 2009 morgan stanley completed the sale pursuant to a secondary offering of its remaining economic and voting interests in us prior to july 1 2008 our consolidated financial statements were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of morgan stanley using the results of operations and bases of assets and liabilities of our business from july 1 2008 to may 22 2009 certain tax allocation and compensation and benefits related information had been derived from the financial statements and accounting records of morgan stanley for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 direct cost allocations related to services provided by morgan stanley were 17 million 183 million and 264 million respectively these allocations were based on what we and morgan stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization levels of these services required in support of our business and are based on methods that include direct time tracking headcount inventory metrics and corporate overhead 

expenses 

compensation and benefits costs represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and typically have represented approximately 50 to 60 of our total operating expenses these costs generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting existing staff compensation and benefit increases and increased staffing levels continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefit costs as of november 30 2009 the number of employees increased by 112 to 878 from 766 on november 30 2008 we continued to increase our staff in emerging market centers during the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 as of november 30 2009 approximately 431 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 279 as of november 30 2008 

information technology costs market data occupancy third party consulting costs and historically expenses related to staff services provided by morgan stanley are also an important part of our expense base 

we group our operating expenses into four categories 

 

  

  

  

 in both the cost of services and sga expense categories compensation and benefits represents the majority of our expenses other costs associated with the number of employees such as office space are included in both the cost of services and sga expense categories consistent with the allocation of employees to those respective areas 

cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data operations and technology software engineering and product management functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits occupancy market data fees information technology and other miscellaneous costs prior to may 22 2009 a portion of these costs were allocated to us by morgan stanley the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

  

selling general and administrative 

this category includes compensation and benefits costs for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such it generally contributes to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses were for occupancy third party consulting costs and information technology prior to may 22 2009 a portion of these costs were allocated to us by morgan stanley 

amortization of intangible assets 

this category consists of expenses related to amortizing intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 at the time of acquisition the intangible assets had weighted average useful lives ranging from 15 to 215 years our intangible assets consist primarily of technology and software trademarks and client relationships at november 30 2009 our intangible assets totaled 1202 million net of accumulated amortization 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

this category consists of expenses related to depreciating the cost of furniture and fixtures computer and communications equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets 

other expense income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our credit facility entered into on november 14 2007 as well as interest we paid on payables to related parties interest we collect on cash balances foreign currency gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition research and development and software capitalization allowance for doubtful accounts tax contingencies impairment of longlived assets and accrued compensation if different assumptions or conditions were to be utilized the results could be materially different from our reported results 

revenue recognition 

revenue related to our nonsoftwarerelated recurring arrangements is recognized pursuant to the requirements of financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 60525 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” under the provisions of asc subtopic 60525 transactions with multiple elements should be considered separate units of accounting if all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

   

 we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for nonsoftwarerelated products include provisions that among other things allow clients for no additional fee to receive updates and modifications that may be made from time to time for the term of the agreement typically one year as we currently do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element of the transaction we do not account for the delivered item as a separate element accordingly we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our softwarerelated recurring revenue arrangements do not require significant modification or customization of any underlying software applications being licensed accordingly we recognize software revenues excluding the energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products pursuant to the requirements of asc subtopic 985605 “ softwarerevenue recognition ” in accordance with asc subtopic 985605 we begin to recognize revenues from subscriptions maintenance and client technical support and professional services when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence of a legally binding arrangement 2 delivery has occurred 3 the client fee is deemed fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for software products include provisions that among other things would allow clients to receive unspecified future software upgrades for no additional fee as well as the right to use the software products with maintenance for the term of the agreement typically one year as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” for these elements except for the support related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we do not account for these elements separately accordingly except for revenues related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our software license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions such provisions generally allow a client to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision we do not record subscription revenues until the earlier of the receipt of a written client acceptance or if not notified by the client that it is cancelling the license agreement the expiration of the acceptance period 

for our energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value if all undelivered elements exists in virtually all of our contracts the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support the fair value of support is determined based upon what the fees for the support are for clients who purchase support separately under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue support fees for these products are recognized ratably over the support period 

we apply sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” “ revenue recognition ” in determining revenue recognition related to clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts these clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets under management or contract volumes these fees are calculated based upon estimated assets in the investment product or contract volumes obtained either through independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information of the client 

we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

 

  

   

  

 we have signed contracts with all clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated these fees are billed in arrears after the fees have been earned the fees are earned as we supply the indices to the client we assess the creditworthiness of these clients prior to entering into a contract and regularly review the receivable balances related to them 

research and development and software capitalization 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including asc subtopic 73010 “ research and development ” and asc subtopic 985730 “softwareresearch and development ” asc subtopic 73010 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred asc subtopic 985730 specifies that costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material and accordingly we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred research and development costs for the fiscal years ended november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 were approximately 530 million 565 million and 570 million respectively 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when it is probable and estimable that a receivable will not be collected the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately 08 million at november 30 2009 07 million at november 30 2008 and 16 million at november 30 2007 changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts from november 30 2006 to november 30 2009 were as follows 

 

 tax contingencies 

prior to may 3 2008 we were a member of the morgan stanley consolidated group and our taxable income was included in the consolidated us federal income tax return of morgan stanley as well as in returns filed by morgan stanley with certain state and local taxing jurisdictions after may 2 2008 upon the disposition by morgan stanley of a portion of its equity interest in us we were no longer eligible to join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with morgan stanley we have filed and will continue to file our 

  

consolidated us federal income tax return as a taxable group separate from morgan stanley our foreign income tax returns have been filed on a separate company basis our federal and foreign income tax liability has been computed and presented in the consolidated financial statements as if we were a separate taxpaying entity in the periods presented the state and local liability presented in these statements reflects the fact that we are included in certain filings of morgan stanley through may 22 2009 when morgan stanley disposed of its remaining equity interest in us and that our tax liability is affected by the attributions of the morgan stanley group we will continue to file certain state income tax returns with morgan stanley on a consolidated combined or unitary basis under applicable state law through may 22 2009 after may 22 2009 we are no longer eligible for inclusion in any state or local consolidated combined or unitary return filed by morgan stanley and going forward we will be filing the relevant state income tax returns as a separate taxable group 

although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed in this annual report on form 10k are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we are required to file income tax returns we have recorded additional tax expense related to open tax years which we believe is adequate in relation to the potential for assessments these amounts have been recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition we believe the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition however to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves a resolution could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for a particular future period in addition an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets and identifiable definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows a loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the fair value to date we have not recognized any impairment loss for longlived assets changes to the expected period in which the intangible asset will be utilized changes in forecasted cash flow changes in technology or client demand could materially impact the value of these assets in the future 

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued nonstock based compensation and benefits expenses a significant portion of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary each year end we determine the amount of discretionary cash bonus pools we also review compensation and benefits expenses throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations we take these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate changes to these factors could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of expense that we report in a particular period accrued non stockbased compensation and related benefits as of november 30 2009 was 599 million 

  

results of operations 

fiscal year ended november 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended november 30 2008 

 

 operating revenues 

 

 total operating revenues for the fiscal year ended november 30 2009 increased 28 to 4429 million compared to 4310 million for the fiscal year ended november 30 2008 the increase was comprised of a 104 million increase in subscription revenues and a 16 million increase in equity index asset based fees subscription revenues consist of our revenues related to equity index subscriptions equity portfolio analytics multiasset class portfolio analytics and other products our revenues are impacted by changes in exchange rates primarily as they related to the us dollar using exchange rates for the same period of the prior year our revenues for fiscal year 2009 would have been higher by 14 million had the us dollar not strengthened relative to the prior year 

  

revenues related to equity indices increased 201 million or 84 to 2596 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 revenues from the equity index subscriptions subcategory were up 109 to 1883 million during the current period with strength across all regions this growth was led by increases in our emerging market small cap and developed market index modules as well as increases in our derivative product licenses fees and user fees which more than offset a decline in fees for historical index data 

revenues attributable to equity index asset based fees subcategory increased 23 to 713 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 697 million in the same period in 2008 led by growth in our etf asset based fee revenues growth in the total number of listed etfs from 167 in fiscal year 2008 to 268 in fiscal year 2009 helped us offset the modest decline in the average value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices of 33 decreasing from 1645 billion for fiscal year 2009 compared to 1702 billion for fiscal year 2008 as of november 30 2009 the value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 2342 billion representing an increase of 1152 billion or 968 from 1190 billion as of november 30 2008 we estimate that the yearoveryear increase in the value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was attributable to net asset appreciation of 667 billion and net asset inflows of 485 billion 

the two msci indices with the largest amount of etf assets linked to them as of november 30 2009 were the msci emerging markets and msci eafe indices the values of assets linked to these indices were 633 billion and 396 billion respectively the third largest value of assets linked to msci indices was 129 billion for both the msci us broad market and brazil indices

revenues related to equity portfolio analytics products decreased 91 million or 69 to 1233 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 1324 million in fiscal 2008 this decrease reflects lower levels of new subscriptions and lower retention rates within equity portfolio analytics aegis revenue declined 83 million or 92 to 821 million while models direct our proprietary risk data accessed directly and barra on vendors our proprietary risk data product accessed through vendors declined 08 million or 19 to 412 million the difficult economic environment affected a number of our clients and led to lower retention rates than in the recent past 

revenues related to multiasset class portfolio analytics increased 28 million or 80 to 376 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 348 million in fiscal year 2008 this reflects an increase of 48 million or 190 to 297 million for barraone and a decrease of 20 million or 199 to 79 million for totalrisk totalrisk is being decommissioned with its existing users being given the opportunity to transition to barraone revenues in this category rose in all client types except for hedge funds 

revenues from other products decreased 18 million or 75 to 225 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 this reflects declines of 21 million or 706 to 09 million in our asset based fees from investment products linked to msci investable hedge fund indices a line of business from which we are exiting and a decrease of 06 million or 97 to 61 million for fixed income analytics these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 09 million or 63 to 152 million for our energy and commodity analytics products 

operating expenses 

operating expenses decreased 11 to 2920 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 2952 million in fiscal year 2008 the decrease reflects lower staff costs allocated from morgan stanley reduced third party consulting costs as well as reduced amortization of our intangible assets partially offset by increases in costs for compensation and benefits depreciation market data and insurance our operating expenses are impacted by changes in exchange rates primarily as they relate to the us dollar using exchange rates for the same period of the prior year our operating expense in fiscal year 2009 would have been higher by 94 million had the us dollar not strengthened relative to the prior year 

the following table sets forth the compensation and benefits and noncompensation expenses for the periods indicated 

 

 compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and have typically represented approximately 50 to 60 of our total operating expenses these costs generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting increased compensation and benefits expenses for current staff and increased staffing levels continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth 

  

of our compensation and benefit expenses as of november 30 2009 the number of employees increased 112 to 878 from 766 on november 30 2008 as of november 30 2009 approximately 540 and 460 of our employees perform duties attributable to the cost of services and sga categories respectively during fiscal year 2009 we continued to increase our staff in emerging market centers as of november 30 2009 approximately 431 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 279 as of november 30 2008 

in fiscal year 2009 compensation and benefits costs were 1805 million an increase of 61 compared to 1700 million in fiscal year 2008 the increase reflects 51 million in stock based compensation costs 29 million in costs related to current staff and increased staffing levels 13 million in costs associated with employee separation agreements and 11 million in retirement benefit costs 

stock based compensation expense for fiscal year 2009 was 349 million compared to 298 million in fiscal year 2008 for fiscal year 2009 stock based compensation consisted of 266 million for founders grant 52 million for retirement eligible employees and 31 million for restricted stock units granted as a component of the 2008 annual bonus for fiscal year 2008 stock based compensation consisted of 256 million for founders grant and 42 million for retirement eligible employees the increase in the expense related to the founders grant is primarily attributable to accelerated vesting of awards for certain terminated employees and adjustments to the estimated rates of forfeiture in fiscal year 2008 there was no nonfullcareer stock based compensation expense associated with the 2008 annual bonus in november 2009 the first tranche of the founders grant award representing 50 of the value of the award vested as a result stock based compensation expense associated with the founders grant will decrease in the years ended november 30 2010 and 2011 

noncompensation expense for the fiscal year 2009 was 1115 million compared to 1251 million for fiscal year 2008 the decrease reflects 165 million related to lower staff costs allocated from morgan stanley 44 million less in costs incurred for third party consulting and a 29 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense of 70 million related to capital expenditures made to operate as an independent company as well as higher market data and insurance costs of 36 million other significant components of our expense base include information technology costs telecommunications services and occupancy costs 

the following table shows operating expenses by each of the categories 

 

   

cost of services 

cost of services includes costs related to our research data operations and technology software engineering and product management functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits occupancy costs market data fees information technology services and for the period prior to may 22 2009 costs allocated by morgan stanley compensation and benefits generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting increases for existing staff and increased staffing levels cost of services decreased 47 million or 38 to 1187 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 1234 million in fiscal year 2008 our cost of services expenses are impacted by changes in exchange rates primarily as they relate to the us dollar using exchange rates for the same period of the prior year our cost of services in fiscal year 2009 would have been higher by 41 million had the us dollar not strengthened relative to the prior year 

compensation and benefit costs increased 50 to 877 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 835 million in fiscal year 2008 the change primarily reflects 22 million in higher stock based compensation costs as previously discussed 15 million in costs associated with employee separation agreements and 07 million in retirement benefit costs noncompensation expenses decreased 89 million or 223 to 310 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 399 million in fiscal year 2008 largely due to the lower staff costs allocated from morgan stanley and decreased information technology costs offset in part by increased market data costs 

selling general and administrative 

sga includes expenses for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology infrastructure corporate administration personnel and for the period prior to may 22 2009 staff costs allocated from morgan stanley as with cost of services the largest expense in this category relates to compensation and benefits other significant expenses are for occupancy costs consulting services and information technology costs for fiscal year 2009 total sga expenses were 1358 million a decrease of 25 million or 18 from 1383 million in fiscal year 2008 our sga expenses are impacted by changes in exchange rates primarily as they relate to the us dollar using exchange rates for the same period of the prior year our sga expenses in fiscal year 2009 would have been higher by 49 million had the us dollar not strengthened relative to the prior year 

compensation and benefits expenses increased 72 to 928 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 866 million in fiscal year 2008 the increase reflects 35 million in costs associated with current staff and increased staffing levels and 29 million in higher stock based compensation costs as previously discussed noncompensation expenses decreased 170 to 430 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to 518 million in fiscal year 2008 the decline is largely due to lower costs allocated by morgan stanley and the reduction of third party consulting costs offset in part by increases in bad debt expenses and insurance costs 

within sga selling expenses increased 23 to 496 million and general and administrative expenses decreased 43 to 862 million for fiscal year 2009 

amortization of intangibles 

in fiscal year 2009 amortization expense totaled 256 million compared to 285 million in fiscal year 2008 a portion of the intangible assets became fully amortized during fiscal year 2008 resulting in the decrease of 29 million or 103 in fiscal year 2009 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements “intangible assets” for further information 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

in fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2008 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements totaled 120 million and 50 million respectively the increase of 70 million principally relates to greater depreciation and amortization of the property equipment and leasehold improvements purchased to operate as an independent company 

  

other expense income net 

in fiscal year 2009 other expense income net decreased 263 to an expense of 193 million compared to an expense of 261 million in fiscal year 2008 the change was primarily due to a 72 million decrease in interest expense due to lower average outstanding debt and the impact of the decrease of interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt and a 39 million decrease in the loss related to changes in foreign exchange rates offset in part by a decrease in interest income of 71 million as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal year 2008 we recorded a 30 million write off of our investment in alacra inc no similar amount was recorded in fiscal year 2009 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased 207 to 499 million in fiscal year 2009 from 414 million in fiscal year 2008 the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2009 was 379 compared to 377 in fiscal year 2008 the 85 million increase in income taxes is primarily the result of higher pretax income

operating revenue 

 

 total operating revenues for fiscal year 2008 increased 611 million or 165 to 4310 million compared to 3699 million for the year ended november 30 2007 “fiscal year 2007” this growth was driven by increases in our revenues from equity indices equity portfolio analytics and multiasset class portfolio analytics the change in foreign currency exchange rates increased revenues by 41 million compared to fiscal year 2007 revenue growth in the fourth fiscal quarter slowed substantially due to the conditions in the financial market which impacted our business especially in our equity index asset based fees and equity portfolio analytics product categories 

revenues from equity indices increased 198 to 2395 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 revenues from equity index data subscriptions increased 239 to 1698 million in fiscal year 2008 reflecting growth in subscriptions across all of our msci global investable market indices products including developed market emerging market and small cap indices and sales of historical index data 

revenues attributable to equity index asset based fees increased 108 to 697 million in fiscal year 2008 from 629 million in fiscal year 2007 led by growth in our etf asset based fee revenues the average value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 1702 billion for fiscal year 2008 compared to 1493 billion for fiscal year 2007 

as of november 30 2008 the value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 1190 billion representing a decrease of 727 billion or 379 from 1917 billion as of november 30 2007 the yearoveryear decline in value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was attributable to net asset depreciation of 997 billion partially offset by net asset inflows of 270 billion 

the three msci indices with the largest amount of etf assets linked to them as of november 30 2008 were the msci eafe emerging markets and us broad market indices the values of assets linked to these indices were 296 billion 226 billion and 82 billion respectively

the following table sets forth the average value of assets in etfs linked to msci indices for the quarters ended in the months indicated 

 

  

source bloomberg and msci 

revenues related to equity portfolio analytics products increased 97 to 1324 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 the increase reflects new subscriptions to our proprietary equity risk data accessed directly and bundled with aegis with notable strength from the broker dealer client segment new gross sales more than offset an increase in cancellations revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 slowed reflecting quantitative fund closures and lower retention rates 

revenues related to multiasset class portfolio analytics increased 508 to 348 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 231 million in the same period in 2007 with an increase of 802 to 250 million for barraone and an increase of 66 to 98 million for totalrisk barraone revenue growth remained strong due to sales to existing clients as well as new client additions led by orders from asset managers and asset owners we are continuing the process of decommissioning our clienthosted product totalrisk and are providing clients with the opportunity to transition to our webbased barraone product 

revenues from other products decreased 73 to 243 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 the decline reflects a decrease of 29 million or 493 to 30 million in asset based fees from investment products linked to msci investable hedge fund indices products and a decrease of 16 million or 188 to 67 million for fixed income analytics offset by an increase of 25 million or 209 to 146 million for our energy and commodity analytics products the decline in hedge fund indices revenues largely reflects lower asset based fees from investment products linked to these indices caused by market depreciation and net asset outflows 

  

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 230 to 2952 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 2399 million in fiscal year 2007 founders grant expenses totaled 256 million for fiscal year 2008 excluding the founders grant expenses operating expenses increased 127 to 2696 million in fiscal year 2008 with increases in compensation and noncompensation expenses of 84 and 183 respectively expenses associated with the replacement of services provided by morgan stanley were 275 million in fiscal year 2008 and were 13 million in fiscal year 2007 and the direct cost allocation expenses related to services provided by morgan stanley personnel was 183 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 264 million in fiscal year 2007 the reduction in allocation expense reflects services that are now performed by us using exchange rates for the same period of the prior year our operating expense in fiscal year 2008 would have been lower by 12 million had the us dollar not strengthened relative to the prior year 

the following table sets forth the compensation and benefits and noncompensation expenses for the periods indicated 

 

 compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and represents between 50 and 60 of our total operating expenses these expenses generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting increased compensation and benefits expenses for current staff and increased staffing levels compensation and benefits expenses in fiscal year 2008 were 1700 million an increase of 359 million or 268 from fiscal year 2007 the increase is a result of 248 million of expenses related to the founders grant and 91 million attributable to people hired in connection with replacing services provided by morgan stanley in addition the increase compared to fiscal year 2007 reflects higher compensation costs for existing staff and new hires offset in part by the movement of positions from developed market centers to emerging market centers 

expenses related to the founders grant of 256 million in fiscal year 2008 and 08 million in fiscal year 2007 reflected the amortization of share based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units and options awarded to employees as a onetime grant which became effective in connection with our ipo completed in november 2007 of the 256 million of founders grant expenses in fiscal year 2008 79 million was recorded in cost of services and 177 million was recorded in sga in fiscal year 2007 02 million was recorded in cost of services and 06 million was recorded in sga 

in fiscal year 2007 no stock based compensation was granted to employees in addition to the onetime founders grant in fiscal year 2008 we accrued 42 million for stock based compensation to retirement eligible employees 

noncompensation expense for fiscal year 2008 increased 193 million to 1251 million compared to fiscal year 2007 the change reflects an increase of 175 million related to the replacement of services provided by morgan stanley personnel 29 million of public company expenses and 16 million associated with the may and july secondary equity offerings partially offset by an 81 million reduction in the expense allocation from morgan stanley 

information technology costs which include market data amortization of hardware and software products and telecommunications services are also an important part of our expense base 

  

because compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses in both the costs of services and sga expense categories we discuss our compensation and benefits and noncompensation expenses separately in each of these categories other costs associated with the number of employees such as office space and professional services are included in both the cost of services and sga expense categories consistent with the allocation of employees to those respective areas the following table shows operating expenses by each of the categories 

 

 cost of services 

cost of services includes costs related to our research data management and production client service software engineering and product management functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits allocated office space market data fees and certain information technology services provided by morgan stanley the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such they generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation and benefits increases for existing staff and increased staffing levels 

cost of services increased 24 million or 20 to 1234 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 1210 million in fiscal year 2007 within cost of services compensation expense increased 71 million to 835 million this increase includes 76 million for the founders grant and higher headcount offset in part by the movement of positions to emerging market centers from developed market centers noncompensation expenses decreased 106 to 399 million due largely to a reduction in the expense allocation from morgan stanley and declines in professional services expenses the expense allocation from morgan stanley decreased 416 to 87 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 150 million in fiscal year 2007 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses include compensation and benefits expenses for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology infrastructure and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation as such compensation and benefits expenses generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation and benefits increases for existing staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses are for services provided by morgan stanley and office space 

sga expenses increased 472 million or 518 to 1383 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to 911 million in fiscal year 2007 compensation and benefits expenses increased 288 million to 866 million the 

  

increase is a result of an increase of 171 million for the founders grant and higher headcount partially offset by the movement of positions to emerging market centers from developed market centers noncompensation expenses increased 553 to 518 million primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with the replacement of services provided by morgan stanley within sga selling expenses increased 115 to 484 million in fiscal year 2008 and general and administrative expenses increased 886 to 899 million 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles expense relates to the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 at november 30 2008 our intangible assets totaled 1459 million net of accumulated amortization for fiscal year 2008 amortization expense totaled 285 million an increase of 21 million compared to fiscal year 2007 the increase is due to a reduction in the useful life of our totalrisk product which is consistent with our timeframe to transition totalrisk clients to barraone see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements “intangible assets” for further information 

depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

in fiscal year 2008 depreciation and amortization of property equipment and leasehold improvements increased 35 million or 2369 to 50 million compared to 15 million in fiscal year 2007 the increase principally relates to greater depreciation and amortization of the property equipment and leasehold improvements purchased to operate independently from morgan stanley 

other expense income net 

interest expense income and other net was an expense of 262 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to income of 33 million in fiscal year 2007 the 295 million change reflects an increase in interest expense of 173 million primarily related to interest on our term loan borrowings under our credit facility a 50 million decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash balances an increase in foreign currency exchange losses of 37 million due to the impact of the appreciation of the us dollar on our monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than us dollars and a 30 million write off of our investment in alacra inc see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements “long term debt” for further information regarding the credit facility 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes decreased 207 to 414 million in fiscal year 2008 as a result of lower pretax income and a decrease in our effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2008 was 377 compared to 391 in fiscal year 2007 the decrease is primarily due to a 37 million net of federal benefit adjustment to the provision made in fiscal year 2007 to record additional tax expense as a result of a settlement between morgan stanley and new york state and new york city tax authorities for the periods 19992006 of which we were allocated a portion of the settlement in addition we recorded a 17 million tax reserve in fiscal year 2007 related to open tax years which we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for assessments 

liquidity and capital resources

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under the credit facility we intend to use these sources of liquidity to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments and acquisitions in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth

cash flows from operating activities 

in fiscal year 2009 net cash provided by operating activities decreased 156 to 1309 million from 1551 million in fiscal year 2008 the decrease is primarily attributable to 278 million in payments to morgan stanley made in the fourth quarter of 2009 for final settlement of certain balances due the majority of which were for taxes previously allocated as part of the tax sharing agreement for further details of the changes in non cash expenses and net assets see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for payment of cash compensation expenses office rent market data technology costs interest and taxes in the nearterm we expect to meet all interest and principal repayment obligations on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility from cash generated by operations the payment of cash compensation expenses is historically at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities was 3082 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of 1121 million in fiscal year 2008 the decrease of 4023 million primarily relates to cash outflows to purchase investments in us treasury securities of 5634 million in fiscal year 2009 offset in part by 2686 million of proceeds received from the maturities of investments and a 121 million decrease in year over year capital expenditures in fiscal year 2008 the amount of cash deposited with morgan stanley decreased by 1376 million as a result of the transfer of this cash to accounts at bank of america in connection with our separation 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows provided by financing activities was 825 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of 230 million in fiscal year 2008 the increase of 1055 million largely represents the net proceeds of 1158 million received from the public offering of our common stock in november 2009 and the 69 million excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation offset in part by an increased outflow of 178 million for the repurchase of shares to be held in treasury

 foreign currency risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

a significant percentage of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating income expense 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 722 million or 163 of our operating revenues for fiscal year 2009 while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets a significant percentage of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of clients in euros japanese yen pounds sterling and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies approximately 546 million or 

  

123 and 608 million or 141 of our revenues for the fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the majority of which were in euros japanese yen and pounds sterling 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs approximately 1021 million or 350 and 811 million or 275 of our expenses for the fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in pounds sterling swiss francs hong kong dollars hungarian forints euros indian rupees and japanese yen expenses paid in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency a loss resulted from the devaluation of the value of the functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 04 million 43 million and 06 million for the fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these amounts were recorded in other expense income in our consolidated statements of income although we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency we minimize exposure by reducing the value of the assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which they are located 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase generally we do not use derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk however we may do so in the future foreign currency cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 1760 million 2681 million and 338 million at november 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these amounts were held primarily in checking and money market accounts in the countries where we maintain banking relationships prior to july 1 2008 the majority of our excess cash was deposited with morgan stanley as of july 1 2008 we did not have any cash deposited with morgan stanley at november 30 2007 amounts held with morgan stanley were 1376 million we received interest at morgan stanley’s internal prevailing rates on these funds the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates declines in interest rates however will reduce future interest income 

borrowings under the credit facility accrued interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus a fixed margin subject to interest rate stepdowns based on the achievement of consolidated leverage ratio conditions as defined in the credit facility on july 8 2008 we met certain conditions as defined in the credit facility and qualified for a tier change resulting in a decrease in the libor fixed margin to 200 for the term loan a facility and 250 for the term loan b facility in the nearterm we expect to pay down the credit facility with cash generated from our ongoing operations 

on february 13 2008 we entered into interest rate swap agreements effective through the end of november 2010 for an aggregate notional principal amount of 2517 million by entering into these agreements we reduced interest rate risk by effectively converting floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt this action reduces our risk of incurring higher interest costs in periods of rising interest rates and improves the overall balance between floating and fixed rate debt the effective fixed rate on the aggregate notional principal amount of 2293 million swapped was approximately 529 for the year ended november 30 2009 on november 30 2009 the effective fixed rate on the notional principal amount swapped was 536 these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under asc subtopic 81510 “ derivatives and hedging” 

  

changes in libor will affect the interest rate on the portion of our credit facilities which have not been hedged by the interest rate swaps and therefore our costs under the credit facilities assuming an average of 1600 million of variable rate debt outstanding a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in libor for a one year period would result in approximately 16 million of additional interest rate expense 

we recorded a pretax loss in other comprehensive income of 17 million 10 million after tax for fiscal year 2009 as a result of the fair value measurement of these swaps the fair value of these swaps is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition

shareholder agreement

risks related to our business 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index and analytics products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data as of november 30 2008 we utilized and distributed certain data provided to us by over 125 data sources including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world if the products of our suppliers have errors are delayed have design defects are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain stock exchanges many of these data suppliers compete with one another and to some extent with us from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us the korea exchange has notified us that if we do not reach a formal agreement regarding our use of the korea exchange’s real time price data the korea exchange will consider instructing the vendor of its real time data to cease supplying us with the data andor the korea exchange will consider taking legal action termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and stock exchanges typically benefit from broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain stock exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts would hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

some of our thirdparty suppliers also are our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

  

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products exchange information with clients through a variety of media including the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex network of internal process and software controls to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in implementation of our internal controls misappropriation of client data could occur such internal control inadequacies could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indices from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indices can affect the prices of constituent securities and products based on our indices our index clients rely on us to keep information about changes to the future composition of an index confidential and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have implemented information barrier procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail and we inadvertently disclose or an individual deliberately misuses information about a change to one of our indices our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list exchange traded funds or other financial products based on our indices only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our indices if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our indices which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and pending thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider certain aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

   

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have in recent years increasingly pursued patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on an index methodology risk model or software application we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow we have made and expect to continue making expenditures related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages required to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us we may also be called upon to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure we monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to reengineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use resulting in our loss of rights or costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating 

  

costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us 

our business is dependent on the financial viability of our clients if our clients are negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets and are forced to shutdown or consolidate our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

most of our clients are in the financial services industry for example asset managers accounted for 676 of our revenues as of november 30 2008 stock market volatility lack of available credit and reduction in revenues in 2008 led to the closure or consolidation of a number of our clients including asset manager brokerdealer and hedge fund clients we expect such events in 2008 to impact our financial results including our run rates and aggregate and core retention rates in the near term furthermore if such trends continue we may not be able to generate future growth and demand for our products may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our clients do not remain financially viable or if the negative conditions in the financial markets persist or worsen we may be forced to increase our provisions for bad debts which could adversely affect our profitability 

our business is dependent on our clients’ continued investment in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the majority of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios to the extent our clients’ investment emphasis significantly changes from equity to fixed income securities or multiasset class or derivative strategies the demand for equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets 

clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets these assetbased fees make up a significant portion of our revenues they were 169 186 and 150 of revenues for the years ended november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 48 52 and 45 of the revenues from our ten largest clients in the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively economic uncertainty and volatile capital markets such as those witnessed in 2008 as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product for example as of november 30 2008 the value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 1190 billion which was 379 lower than the value of such assets as of november 30 2007 net asset depreciation accounted for 997 billion of the decline which was offset by 270 billion in net asset inflows also uncertain market conditions have resulted in investments being directed away from mutual funds for example according to the investment company institute the outflows for equity mutual funds in the united states yeartodate as of november 2008 were 2157 billion continuing economic uncertainty and market volatility could result in the fluctuation of or increased declines in our assetbased fees which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation within our target markets may affect our business 

consolidation in the financial services industry could reduce our existing client base and the number of potential clients for example stock market volatility and the lack of available credit and reductions in revenues in 2008 led to the closure or merger of a number of our clients including brokerdealer asset manager and hedge fund clients if consolidation continues it may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth and may reduce demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our indices could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenues are concentrated in some of our largest clients our clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to try to decrease our fees accordingly for example competition is intense and increasing among our clients that provide exchange traded funds the fees they charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers additionally clients that have licensed our indices to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indices and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments 

the market for our products is characterized by shifting client demands evolving market practices and for some of our products rapid technological change changed client demands new market practices or new technologies can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and respond to technological and market changes we may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing our new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements 

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 286 308 and 305 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 our largest client organization by revenue barclays plc and affiliates accounted for 110 126 and 112 of our total revenues respectively for the fiscal year 2008 approximately 897 of the revenue from barclays came from fees based on the assets in barclays’ exchange traded funds based on msci indices 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe this practice supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop independently certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our 

  

competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry to create a singlepurpose product may be low in many cases the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or equity indices these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and we expect this trend to continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth during our operating history there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past for example our attempt to expand our index products to include fixed income indices was not as successful as we anticipated so we decided to terminate our efforts to develop proprietary fixed income indices see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow internally or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting and retaining additional qualified personnel expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” 

  

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

a principal element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any future acquisitions could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that we experience a high level of acquisition related activity within a limited period of time the possibility of occurrence of these risks would likely increase for that period in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

substantially all of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating income expense 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 169 and 186 of operating revenues for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 and 2007 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets substantially all of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

  

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 and 2007 approximately 141 and 153 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars approximately half of our foreign currency revenues were in euros and a quarter in pounds sterling and japanese yen respectively over those periods 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs although our expenses are generally in us dollars some of our operating expenses are incurred in nonus dollar denominated currencies approximately 275 and 231 of our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended november 30 2008 and 2007 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in swiss francs pounds sterling hong kong dollars euros japanese yen and hungarian forint expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us and replace services provided by morgan stanley which are paid in us dollars 

we have certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency a loss resulted from the devaluation of the value of the functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 43 million for the fiscal year ended november 30 2008 these losses on foreign currency exchange were primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

   

  

 we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products however these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

on november 14 2007 we entered into the 5000 million credit facility see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us—credit facility” and “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” as of november 30 2008 we had 4028 million of indebtedness under the credit facility 3805 million in long term debt and 223 million in current maturities and cash and cash equivalents of 2681 million 

the credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares 

  

of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make or hold investments merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis except as described in “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed a 37510 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 32510 thereafter and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be a 30010 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 40010 thereafter 

in addition our credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are dependent upon any individual employee the loss of a group of our key professional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human 

  

error national disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the internet occur our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients may be materially and adversely affected 

catastrophic events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires floods earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where we or our clients are located and other catastrophic events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity measures we have taken to reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events will be sufficient 

such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity measures will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these measures will be accurate 

we are subject to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

as we continue to expand our international operations we increase our exposure to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability we have recently opened sales offices in shanghai dubai and mumbai and have made preparations to open an office in monterrey mexico we have also established and intend to further grow our presence in the middle east asia africa eastern europe and latin america for example on november 30 2008 we had 141 fulltime employees in mumbai and budapest compared to 67 on november 30 2007 in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

we may incur unanticipated costs in connection with establishing and maintaining offices in emerging market locations 

our plans call for us to increase the proportion of our employees in emerging market locations the cost of establishing and maintaining these offices including costs related to information technology infrastructure as well as the costs of attracting and retaining employees in these locations may be higher or may increase at a faster rate than we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

risks related to our relationship with morgan stanley 

morgan stanley owns a controlling interest in our company and the interests of morgan stanley may conflict with ours and with those of our other shareholders 

as of november 30 2008 morgan stanley owned 1000 of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b common stock generally has five votes per share other than with respect to a limited number of matters specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation such as approval of transactions by which a thirdparty might acquire control of us as of november 30 2008 morgan stanley as the only holder of shares of class b common stock controlled approximately 657 of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock except when amending or altering any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws so as to adversely affect the rights of the other class for example morgan stanley is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors who determine our strategic plans approve major financing decisions and appoint top management in addition as a holder of all of our class b common stock morgan stanley may seek to cause us to take courses of action that in its judgment could enhance its investment in us but which might involve risks to holders of our class a common stock or adversely affect us or other investors because morgan stanley’s interests as our controlling shareholder may differ from other investors’ interests actions taken by morgan stanley with respect to us may not be favorable to other investors 

we have also entered into an amended services agreement and a number of other agreements with morgan stanley setting forth various matters governing our relationship with morgan stanley while it remains a significant shareholder in us for a description of these agreements see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” these agreements govern the provision of corporate services to us and are likely to affect our ability to make certain acquisitions or to merge or consolidate or to sell all or substantially all our assets the rights of morgan stanley under these agreements may allow morgan stanley to delay or prevent an acquisition of us or prevent a redemption or repurchase of our common stock that our other shareholders including you may consider favorable we may not be able to terminate these agreements or amend them in a manner we deem more favorable except in accordance with their terms 

conflicts of interest may arise between morgan stanley and us that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us 

questions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between morgan stanley and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships areas in which conflicts of interest between morgan stanley and us could arise include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

   

  

 our historical financial results are derived from our results as a subsidiary of morgan stanley and include allocated costs for functions historically provided by morgan stanley and therefore may not be representative of our results as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented and may not be indicative of the results we will achieve over time as a standalone public company the historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by morgan stanley including portions of human resources information technology accounting legal and compliance tax office space leasing corporate services and treasury these allocations were based on what we and morgan stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in support of our business the historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations financial condition cash flows or costs and expenses will be over time or that our costs as a standalone company will be similar for additional information see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “item 6—selected consolidated financial data” and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

since the completion of our ipo in november 2007 we have been establishing our own financial administrative and other support functions to replace those services provided by morgan stanley and we cannot assure you that over time we will be able to operate our business as effectively or cost efficiently as morgan stanley 

historically we have relied on certain financial administrative and other resources of morgan stanley to operate our business both domestically and internationally we completed our ipo in november 2007 and as a result of our ipo we began enhancing certain financial legal and compliance administrative information technology and other support systems and processes or contracting with third parties to replace morgan stanley’s systems 

  

at the time of the ipo we entered into a services agreement which was subsequently amended with morgan stanley pursuant to which morgan stanley will continue to provide some of these services to us for so long as morgan stanley owns greater than 50 of the total voting power to elect our directors the services morgan stanley will continue to provide upon owning 50 or less of the total voting power to elect our directors are subject to renegotiation in good faith and will be provided for a period not to exceed 12 months 

for so long as morgan stanley owns greater than 50 of the total voting power to elect our directors compensation for services under the amended services agreement with morgan stanley will be determined consistent with past practices using an internal cost allocation methodology based on fully loaded cost  ie  allocated direct costs of providing the services plus all related overhead and outofpocket costs and expenses as well as the portion of compensation related expenses for morgan stanley senior executives as allocated to us see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” for a description of these arrangements for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 expenses related to services provided by morgan stanley personnel were 183 million 264 million and 231 million respectively for the threemonth periods ended november 30 2008 and 2007 expenses related to services provided by morgan stanley personnel were 23 million and 66 million respectively we currently rely on morgan stanley primarily for certain itrelated services see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” 

the services we have obtained to replace those provided by morgan stanley have been established within the last year and may not be sufficient to meet our needs upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of our business assets or properties morgan stanley’s obligation to provide any service in respect of such disposed business assets or properties will terminate similarly if our business increases significantly or we acquire any business assets or properties morgan stanley will not have to provide any services in respect of such increase or acquired business assets or properties these services may not be sufficient to meet our needs and after these agreements with morgan stanley terminate we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at acceptable prices and terms any failure or significant downturn in our financial or administrative policies and systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in connection with our ipo we entered into agreements with morgan stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters that may be on terms less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with another party and we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

in connection with our ipo we entered into agreements with morgan stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters while still a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley accordingly the terms of these agreements may not reflect those that would have been reached with another party on an arm’slength basis if these agreements were entered into with another party we may have obtained more favorable terms see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” 

pursuant to certain of these agreements we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

we may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in the purchasing power and other operational efficiencies we have had due to our association with morgan stanley 

we have been able to take advantage of morgan stanley’s purchasing power in the us and internationally in procuring goods technology and services including market data travel insurance employee benefit support and audit services as a standalone company we may be unable to obtain goods technology and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to becoming a standalone company which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

additionally if we are unable to continue to file combined returns with morgan stanley our tax liability may also increase due to increased income taxed in certain state and local jurisdictions where combined filings were previously made with morgan stanley 

further morgan stanley has been influential in our ability to attract and retain research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other personnel as a standalone company it may be more difficult and costly for us to attract and retain such personnel the development maintenance support and use of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—risks related to our business—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may experience a loss in the marketing and reputational value we currently have due to our association with the morgan stanley name 

we believe we have received marketing and reputational benefits from our association with the morgan stanley brand name as a standalone company that may no longer be the case consequently our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients and our reputation may be adversely affected 

the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting all of the procedures and practices required as a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley were previously established but we have established additional procedures and practices as a standalone public company as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur furthermore the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our growth strategy which could prevent us from improving our business results of operations and financial condition we have made and will continue to make changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a standalone public company however the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company in addition we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements 

morgan stanley continues to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards under the new york stock exchange rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by another company is a “controlled company” and need not comply with certain requirements including 1 the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 the requirement that the nominatingcorporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 3 the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 4 the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees we intend to 

  

utilize these exemptions as a result we will not have a majority of independent directors nor will our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors accordingly shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

because holders of the shares of class b common stock will control the majority of the voting power of all classes of voting stock other shareholders will not be able to determine the outcome of shareholder votes 

holders of our class a common stock have one vote per share and holders of our class b common stock generally have five votes per share other than with respect to a limited number of matters specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation such as approval of transactions by which a thirdparty might acquire control of us morgan stanley as the holder of all of our shares of class b common stock controls approximately 657 of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock other than with respect to those matters for example morgan stanley is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors who determine our strategic plans including certain acquisitions approve major financing decisions and appoint top management in addition the holders of the class b common stock may seek to cause us to take courses of action that in their judgment could enhance their investment in us but which might involve risks to holders of our class a common stock or adversely affect us or other investors all of the class b common stock is beneficially owned by morgan stanley and class b shares are only transferable to morgan stanley capital group international or one of their subsidiaries or affiliates any such shares of class b common stock transferred to a person other than morgan stanley capital group international or one of their subsidiaries or affiliates automatically convert into one share of class a common stock upon such disposition morgan stanley may in the future decide to divest all or a portion of its interest in the class b common stock 

if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our class a common stock the price of our class a common stock could decline 

the trading market for our class a common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for you 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our class a common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our class a common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock this would include sales by morgan stanley and restricted shares of class a common stock and options to purchase shares of class a common stock granted in connection with our ipo and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plan 

as of november 30 2008 72354383 shares of our class a common stock were outstanding and freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act as of november 30 2008 morgan stanley held 2770865379 shares of our class b common stock any shares of class b common stock transferred to a person other than morgan stanley capital group international or one of their subsidiaries or affiliates automatically converts into one share of class a common stock upon such disposition 

in november 2007 we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan as of november 30 2008 we had issued 98687 and 8292 shares of class a common stock under the msci amended and restated 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan respectively 

also in the future we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the outstanding common stock 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our class a common stock 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our class a common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

moreover we have opted out of the business combination provisions of section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware the “dgcl” until such time as morgan stanley owns 50 or less of the total voting power to elect our directors after which we will be governed by these provisions section 203 prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our class a common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of our company thereby reducing the likelihood that investors could receive a premium for your class a common stock in an acquisition 

we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth including growth through acquisitions the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements business conditions corporate law requirement and other factors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those identified below and those discussed in “item 1a—risk factors” 

overview 

we are a leading global provider of investment decision support tools including indices and portfolio risk and performance analytics for use by institutions in managing equity fixed income and multiasset class portfolios our flagship products are our international equity indices marketed under the msci brand and our equity portfolio analytics marketed under the barra brand our products are used in many areas of the investment process including portfolio construction and optimization performance benchmarking and attribution risk management and analysis indexlinked investment product creation asset allocation investment manager selection and investment research 

our clients include asset owners such as pension funds endowments foundations central banks and insurance companies institutional and retail asset managers such as managers of pension assets mutual funds exchange traded funds “etfs” hedge funds and private wealth and financial intermediaries such as brokerdealers exchanges custodians and investment consultants as of november 30 2008 we had over 3100 clients across 64 countries we had 20 offices in 14 countries to help serve our diverse client base with approximately 52 of our revenue from clients in the americas 33 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” 8 in japan and 7 in asiapacific not including japan based on fiscal year 2008 revenues 

our principal sales model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at specified locations by a given number of users for an annual fee paid up front the substantial majority of our revenues come from these annual recurring subscriptions over time as their needs evolve our clients often add product modules users and locations to their subscriptions which results in an increase in our revenues per client additionally a significant source of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for indexlinked investment products such as etfs these clients commonly pay us a license fee based on the investment product’s assets we also generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indices as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee based on their volume of trades 

in evaluating our financial performance we focus on revenue growth for the company in total and by product category as well as operating profit growth and the level of profitability as measured by our operating margin our business is not highly capital intensive and as such we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our operating profits into excess cash in the future we expect to use this cash to make investments in our business both internally and externally through acquisitions in order to capitalize on the many growth opportunities before us and to expand our market position our revenue growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing equity product offerings as well as further developing and growing our investment tools for multiasset class investment institutions and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings see “item 1—business—growth strategy” 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we will continue to invest in and expand our operating functions and infrastructure including new sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world additional staff and supporting technology for our research and our data management and production functions and additional personnel and supporting technology in our general and administrative 

  

functions particularly finance and human resources personnel required to operate as a standalone public company at the same time managing and controlling our operating expenses is very important to us and a distinct part of our culture over time our goal is to keep the rate of growth of our operating expenses below the rate of growth of our revenues allowing us to expand our operating margins however at times because of significant market opportunities it may be more important to us to invest in our business in order to support increased efforts to attract new clients and to develop new product offerings rather than emphasize shortterm operating margin expansion furthermore in some periods our operating expense growth may exceed our operating revenue growth due to the variability of revenues from several of our products including our equity indices licensed as the basis of etfs 

product enhancements continued throughout fiscal years 2007 and 2008 in 2007 aegis 41 barraone 19 and the msci global investable market indices “gimi” methodology were released recent launches in our index products include the creation of the msci frontier market indices the msci asia apex 50 index and the msci global minimum volatility indices we also launched gem2 an enhanced version of our global equity model gem and aegis 42 the corresponding software application within our multiasset class portfolio analytics product category significant product launches include barraone 32 and monte carlo value at risk see “item 1 business—our products and services” 

business environment 

various sectors of the global financial market have been adversely affected by a current market environment that includes illiquidity and widening credit spreads unprecedented market volatility and changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates investor participation levels and legal and regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements commencing in the second half of 2008 the conditions in the financial market impacted our business particularly with respect to our equity index asset based fees due to declines in the value of assets in etfs linked to our products and our revenues from our equity portfolio analytics due to the closure of dedicated quant funds both standalone and within traditional asset managers and quantitative teams which support fundamental money managers 

the vast majority of our business is granting licenses to clients in the financial services industry including asset managers brokersdealers exchanges and other institutional clients the lack of available credit lack of confidence in the financial sector increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity have had a negative impact on a number of our clients and if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen we could in turn experience additional negative effects on revenues from subscriptions to our products and fees from investment products linked to our indices 

we do not believe that our liquidity has been affected by the recent events in the global financial markets see “—liquidity and capital resources—cash flows” below 

key financial metrics and drivers 

revenues 

our principal sales model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at specified locations by a given number of client users for an annual fee paid upfront the substantial majority of our revenues come from these annual recurring subscriptions these fees are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized each month on our income statement as the service is rendered over time as their needs evolve our clients often add product modules users and locations to their subscriptions which results in an increase in our revenues per client additionally a significant source of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs passive mutual funds and structured products these clients commonly pay us a license fee based on the investment product’s assets 

  

we group our revenues into the following four product categories 

equity indices 

this category includes fees from msci equity index data subscriptions fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indices fees from onetime licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from custom msci indices we also generate a limited amount of revenues based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indices 

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indices also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes investment inflows and outflows and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period 

equity portfolio analytics 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barra aegis and our proprietary risk data in barra aegis equity models direct products and our proprietary equity risk data incorporated in thirdparty software application offerings  eg  barra on vendors 

barra aegis has many uses including portfolio risk analysis and forecasting optimization and factorbased portfolio performance attribution a base subscription for use in portfolio analysis typically involves a subscription to barra aegis and various risk data modules a client may add portfolio performance attribution optimization tools process automation tools or other features to its barra aegis subscription by licensing the client to receive additional software modules and risk data or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can increase our revenues per client further 

our equity models direct risk data is distributed directly to clients who then combine it with their own software applications or upload the risk data onto thirdparty applications a base subscription to our equity models direct product provides equity risk data for a set fee that authorizes one to two users by licensing the client to receive equity risk model data for additional countries or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can further increase our revenues per client 

the barra on vendors product makes our proprietary risk data from our equity models direct product available to clients via third party providers such as factset research systems inc 

multiasset class portfolio analytics 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barraone and barra totalrisk together with our proprietary risk data for multiple asset classes currently we are actively selling subscriptions only to barraone and related risk data most of the features and functionality of totalrisk have been added to barraone and we are decommissioning totalrisk as this happens we will offer our totalrisk clients the opportunity to transition to barraone as this transition takes place revenues from this product group will increasingly come from barraone therefore we expect declines in revenues from totalrisk 

  

other products 

this category includes revenues from a number of products including fea for energy and commodity asset valuation analytics barra cosmos for fixed income analytics and hedge fund indices and products 

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of our total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as our “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking fees for the next 12 months from all subscriptions and investment product licenses we currently provide to our clients under renewable contracts assuming all contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent exchange rates for any license whose fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume with the exception of etfs the run rate calculation reflects an annualization of the most recent periodic fee earned under such license the run rate for etfs was calculated based on the average aum for the last month of the fiscal quarter the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal at the time we receive such notice even if the notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future fees there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the following table sets forth our run rate as of the dates indicated and the percentage growth over the prior period 

 

  

 changes in run rate between periods reflect increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indices the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indices price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

retention rates 

because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues other key metrics are our “aggregate retention rate” and “core retention rate which are collectively referred to as “retention rates” the annual aggregate retention rate represents the retained subscription run rate beginning subscription run rate less actual cancels during the year as a percentage of the subscription run rate at the beginning of the fiscal year if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our aggregate retention rate our core retention rate is calculated in the same way as our aggregate retention rate except that the core retention rate does not treat switches between products as a cancellation our aggregate and core retention rates are computed on a productbyproduct basis in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate aggregate or core retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indices or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indices aggregate and core retention rates for a nonannual period reflect the annualization of the cancels recorded in the period 

  

the following table sets forth our retention rates as of the dates indicated 

 

 the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

  

   

the following table sets forth our core retention rates by product category for the periods indicated for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 comparable data for fiscal year 2006 is not available 

 

  

 the quarterly retention rates are calculated by annualizing the actual cancellations recorded during the quarter this annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year to calculate a cancellation rate this cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100 to derive the annualized retention rate for the quarter 

for example in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded cancellations of 152 million to derive the aggregate retention rate for the fourth quarter we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of 152 million to derive 608 million of annualized cancellations this 608 million was then divided by the subscription run rate at the beginning of the year of 3134 million to derive a cancellation rate of 194 the 194 was then subtracted from 1000 to derive an aggregate retention rate for the quarter of 806 

for the calculation of the core retention rate the same methodology was used except the amount of cancellations in the quarter was reduced by the amount of product swaps for example in fourth quarter 2008 we had product swaps of 37 million which was subtracted from the 152 million of actual cancels to derive core cancels of 115 million this 115 million was annualized to derive 460 million of annualized cancellations which was then divided by the beginning year run rate of 3134 million to derive a cancellation rate of 147 the 147 was then subtracted from 100 to derive the core retention rate of 853 for the fourth quarter 

retention rates for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 declined reflecting stock market volatility the closure or merger of a number of our clients and the shutdown of quantitative funds and teams in fiscal 2008 48 of our cancellations occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter in recent years on average approximately 40 of our subscription cancellations have occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result retention rates are generally higher during the first three fiscal quarters and lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 

  

expenses 

compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and typically represent 50 to 60 of our total operating expenses these expenses generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting current staff compensation and benefit increases and increased staffing levels as we continue to replace morgan stanley services we will incur greater compensation and benefits related expenses continued growth of our staff in lower cost locations around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits expenses as of november 30 2008 28 of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 18 as of november 30 2007 an important location for us is mumbai india where we have increased our staff levels significantly since commencing our operations there in early 2004 with a small staff in data management and production subsequently we expanded the scale of our operations there by adding teams in research and administration as well as by continuing to expand the data management and production team our office in mumbai has grown from 12 employees as of november 30 2004 to 86 fulltime employees as of november 30 2008 another important location for us is budapest hungary where we opened an office in august 2007 we plan to continue to develop this location as an important information technology and software engineering center our budapest office had 55 employees as of november 30 2008 in the second half of 2008 we made preparations to open an office in monterrey mexico to serve clients in the americas 

another significant expense for us is the allocation and replacement expenses related to services provided by our principal shareholder morgan stanley as a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley historically we have relied on morgan stanley to provide a number of administrative support services and facilities although we will continue to operate under the amended services agreement with morgan stanley the amount and composition of our expenses may vary from historical levels as we replace these services with ones supplied by us or by third parties see “item 1 business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us—services agreement” in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 we invested in expanding our own administrative functions including finance legal and compliance and human resources as well as information technology infrastructure to replace services currently provided by morgan stanley because of initial setup costs and overlaps with services provided by morgan stanley our expenses increased in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 and as we continue to expand and replace these services our expenses may continue to increase see “item 1a risk factors—since the completion of our ipo in november 2007 we have been establishing our own financial administrative and other support functions to replace those services provided by morgan stanley and we cannot assure you that over time we will be able to operate our business as effectively or cost efficiently as morgan stanley” in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 we incurred additional costs as a public company including directors’ compensation audit listing fees investor relations stock administration and regulatory compliance costs 

information technology costs which include market data amortization of hardware and software products and telecommunications services are also an important part of our expense base 

we group our expenses into three categories 

 

  

  

 in both the cost of services and sga expense categories compensation and benefits represents the majority of our expenses other costs associated with the number of employees such as office space and professional services are included in both the cost of services and sga expense categories consistent with the allocation of employees to those respective areas 

cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data management and production software engineering and product management functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits allocated office space market data fees and certain information technology services provided by morgan stanley the largest 

  

expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such they generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation and benefits increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

selling general and administrative 

this category includes compensation and benefits expenses for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology infrastructure and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such they generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses are for services provided by morgan stanley and office space 

amortization of intangible assets 

this category consists of expenses related to amortizing intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 at the time of acquisition the intangible assets had weighted average useful lives ranging from 15 to 215 years our intangible assets consist primarily of technology and software trademarks and client relationships at november 30 2008 our intangible assets totaled 1459 million net of accumulated amortization for the fiscal year ended november 30 2008 amortization expenses related to intangibles amounted to 285 million and represented 97 of our total operating expenses of 2952 million 

interest expense income and other net 

this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our credit facility entered into on november 14 2007 as well as interest we pay on payables to related parties interest we collect on cash balances including cash deposited with morgan stanley prior to july 1 2008 foreign currency gains and losses as well as other nonoperating income and expense items for the fiscal year ending november 30 2007 interest expense income and other net also included interest incurred on the demand note payable to morgan stanley all outstanding balances on the demand note were paid as of november 20 2007 average cash balances and the weighted average yield received are the two largest factors causing changes in interest income from period to period as a result of the payment in cash and the demand notes associated with the 9730 million dividend paid on july 19 2007 described below under “—factors impacting comparability of our financial results—july 2007 dividend” and our credit facility we incurred substantially lower interest income and substantially higher interest expense which we expect to remain consistent in future periods 

factors impacting comparability of our financial results 

our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or with our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below 

barra acquisition and divestiture of posit jv 

on june 3 2004 morgan stanley completed the acquisition of barra on december 1 2004 morgan stanley contributed barra to us the contribution of barra was accounted for as a transfer of net assets between entities under common control and therefore we have presented our financial position and results of operations as if barra had been combined with us from the date of the acquisition founded in 1975 barra became a public company in 1991 trading on the nasdaq under the ticker symbol barz 

on february 1 2005 we sold for 900 million our 50 interest in posit jv a joint venture that owned the intellectual property for and certain licenses underlying the posit equity crossing system that matches institutional buyers and sellers to our joint venture partner itg we recorded a pretax gain of 68 million at 

  

the time of sale we acquired the posit jv interest as part of our acquisition of barra as part of the sale agreement we were entitled to additional royalties for a period of 10 years subsequent to the sale pursuant to an earnout arrangement based on fees earned by itg related to the posit system in september 2006 itg exercised its option to accelerate the earnout period by making a lump sum payment to us of 117 million in addition we received royalty payments of 32 million and 10 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006 respectively prior to the lump sum earnout payment with the issuance of fasb interpretation 46r consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46r barra determined that posit jv qualified as a variable interest entity barra was entitled to 95 of the gains and losses of the joint venture and thus consolidated posit jv we accounted for the results of operations of posit jv the gain on sale of posit jv and the lump sum payment from itg as discontinued operations in our financial statements

prior to july 1 2008 our consolidated financial statements were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of morgan stanley using the historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities of our business following july 1 2008 only certain tax allocation and compensation and benefits related information have been derived from the financial statements and accounting records of morgan stanley the historical costs and expenses reflected in our audited consolidated financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by morgan stanley including human resources information technology accounting legal and compliance tax office space leasing corporate services treasury and other services on july 21 2008 we entered into an amended services agreement with morgan stanley pursuant to which morgan stanley and its affiliates agreed to provide us with certain of these services for so long as morgan stanley owns greater than 50 of the total voting power to elect our directors and for periods varying for different services of up to 12 months thereafter for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 direct cost allocation expenses related to services provided by morgan stanley personnel were 183 million 264 million and 231 million respectively these allocations were based on what we and morgan stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization levels of these services required in support of our business and are based on methods that include direct time tracking headcount inventory metrics and corporate overhead the historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations financial condition or cash flows will be in the future

public company expenses 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act all of the procedures and practices required as a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley were previously established but we have and continue to add procedures and practices required as a public company as a result we have incurred public company expenses including legal accounting and other expenses of 54 million and 09 million for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 and 2007 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition research and development and software capitalization allowance for doubtful accounts tax contingencies impairment of longlived assets and accrued compensation if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail the results could be materially different from our reported results 

revenue recognition 

revenue related to our nonsoftwarerelated recurring arrangements is recognized pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force 0021 “eitf 0021” “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” under eitf 0021 transactions with multiple elements should be considered separate units of accounting if all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

   

we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for these products include provisions that among other things allow clients for no additional fee to receive updates and modifications that may be made from time to time for the term of the agreement typically one year as we currently do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of this element of the transaction we do not account for the delivered item as a separate element accordingly we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our softwarerelated recurring revenue arrangements do not require significant modification or customization of any underlying software applications being licensed accordingly we recognize software revenues excluding the energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products pursuant to the requirements of statement of position “sop” 972 “ software revenue recognition ” as amended by sop 989 “ modification of sop 972  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions ” in accordance with sop 972 we begin to recognize revenues from subscriptions maintenance and client technical support and professional services when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence of a legally binding arrangement 2 delivery has occurred 3 client fee is deemed fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for software products include provisions that among other things would allow clients to receive unspecified future software upgrades for no additional fee as well as the right to use the software products with maintenance for the term of the agreement typically one year as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” for these elements except for the support related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we do not account for these elements separately accordingly except for revenues related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our software license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions such provisions generally allow a client to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision we do not record subscription revenues until the earlier of the receipt of a written client acceptance or if not notified by the client that it is cancelling the license agreement the expiration of the acceptance period 

for our energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists in virtually all of our contracts the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support the fair value of support is determined based upon what the fees for the support are for clients who purchase support separately under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue support fees for these products are recognized ratably over the support period 

we apply staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” revenue recognition  in determining revenue recognition related to clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts these clients commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets under management or contract volumes these fees are calculated based upon estimated assets in the investment product or contract volumes obtained either through independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information of the client 

we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

 

  

   

  

 we have signed contracts with all clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated these fees are billed in arrears after the fees have been earned the fees are earned as we supply the indices to the client we assess the creditworthiness of these clients prior to entering into a contract and regularly review the receivable balances related to them 

research and development and software capitalization 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs sfas no 2 and sfas no 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed sfas no 86 sfas no 2 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred sfas no 86 specifies that costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material and accordingly we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred research and development costs for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 were approximately 565 million 570 million and 554 million respectively 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when it is probable and estimable that a receivable will not be collected the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately 07 million at november 30 2008 and approximately 16 million at each of november 30 2007 and 2006 changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts from november 30 2006 to november 30 2008 were as follows 

 

 tax contingencies 

prior to may 2 2008 our taxable income was included in the consolidated us federal income tax return of morgan stanley and continues to be included in returns filed by morgan stanley with certain state taxing jurisdictions our foreign income tax returns have always been filed on a separate company basis our federal and foreign income tax liability has been computed and presented in the consolidated financial statements as if we were a separate taxpaying entity in the periods presented the state and local tax liability presented in these statements reflects the fact that we are included in certain state filings of morgan stanley and that our tax liability is affected by the attributions of the group we will generally continue to file certain state income tax returns with morgan stanley on a consolidated combined or unitary basis under applicable state law until we are 

  

no longer permitted to do so if morgan stanley’s ownership of our common stock falls below the relevant threshold which may occur as a result of among other things a subsequent sale by morgan stanley of our common stock we will file the relevant state income tax return as a separate taxable group 

although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed in this annual report on form 10k are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets and identifiable definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows a loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the fair value to date we have not recognized any impairment loss for longlived assets changes to the expected period in which the intangible asset will be utilized changes in forecasted cash flow changes in technology or client demand could materially impact the value of these assets in the future 

as part of a product review on july 15 2007 we decided to transition certain clients from barra totalrisk to barraone and other products at the end of the transition totalrisk will no longer be offered we performed an impairment test in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 we have determined there is no impairment of this asset in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 the remaining useful life of the asset was shortened from fourandahalf years to twoandahalf years the revised useful life will result in higher amortization expenses related to this asset of 35 million for each of the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 and 2009 

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued nonstock based compensation and benefits expenses a significant portion of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary each yearend we determine the amount of discretionary cash bonus pools we also review compensation and benefits expenses throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations we take these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate changes to these factors could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of expense that we report in a particular period accrued non stockbased compensation and related benefits as of november 30 2008 was 550 million

operating revenues 

 

 total operating revenues for the year ended november 30 2008 increased 611 million or 165 to 4310 million compared to 3699 million for the year ended november 30 2007 this growth was driven by increases in our revenues from equity indices equity portfolio analytics and multiasset class portfolio analytics the change in foreign currency exchange rates increased revenues by 41 million compared to fiscal 2007 revenue growth in the fourth fiscal quarter slowed substantially due to the conditions in the financial market which have impacted our business especially in our equity index asset based fees and equity portfolio analytics product categories 

revenues from equity indices increased 198 to 2395 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 revenues from equity index data subscriptions increased 239 to 1698 million in fiscal 2008 reflecting growth in subscriptions across all of our msci global investable market indices products including developed market emerging market and small cap indices and sales of historical index data 

  

revenues attributable to equity index asset based fees increased 108 to 697 million in fiscal 2008 from 629 million in the same period in 2007 led by growth in our etf asset based fee revenues the average value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 1702 billion for fiscal 2008 compared to 1493 billion for fiscal 2007 as of november 30 2008 the value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was 1190 billion representing a decrease of 727 billion or 379 from 1917 billion as of november 30 2007 the yearoveryear decline in value of assets in etfs linked to msci equity indices was attributable to net asset depreciation of 997 billion partially offset by net asset inflows of 270 billion 

the three msci indices with the largest amount of etf assets linked to them as of november 30 2008 were the msci eafe emerging markets and us broad market the values of assets linked to these indices were 296 billion 226 billion and 82 billion respectively

the following table sets forth the average value of assets in etfs linked to msci indices for the quarters ended in the months indicated 

 

  

source bloomberg and msci 

revenues related to equity portfolio analytics products increased 97 to 1324 million in fiscal 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the increase reflects new subscriptions to our proprietary equity risk data accessed directly and bundled with aegis with notable strength from the broker dealer client segment new gross sales more than offset an increase in cancellations revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 slowed reflecting quantitative fund closures and lower retention rates 

revenues related to multiasset class portfolio analytics increased 508 to 348 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 231 million in the same period in 2007 with an increase of 802 to 250 million for barraone and an increase of 66 to 98 million for totalrisk barraone revenue growth remained strong due to sales to existing clients as well as new client additions led by orders from asset managers and asset owners we are continuing the process of decommissioning our clienthosted product totalrisk and are providing clients with the opportunity to transition to our webbased barraone product 

revenues from other products decreased 73 to 243 million for the fiscal year 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the decline reflects a decrease of 29 million or 493 to 30 million in asset based 

  

fees from investment products linked to msci investable hedge fund indices products and a decrease of 16 million or 188 to 67 million for fixed income analytics offset by an increase of 25 million or 209 to 146 million for our energy and commodity analytics products the decline in hedge fund indices revenues largely reflects lower asset based fees from investment products linked to these indices caused by market depreciation and net asset outflows 

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 230 to 2952 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 2399 million in fiscal 2007 founders grant expenses totaled 256 million for fiscal 2008 excluding the founders grant expenses operating expenses increased 127 to 2696 million in fiscal 2008 with increases in compensation and noncompensation expenses of 84 and 183 respectively expenses associated with the replacement of services currently provided by morgan stanley were 275 million in fiscal 2008 and were 13 million in fiscal 2007 and the direct cost allocation expenses related to services provided by morgan stanley personnel was 183 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 264 million in fiscal 2007 the reduction in allocation expense reflects services that are now performed by us the change in foreign exchange rates increased expenses by 12 million compared to 2007 

the following table sets forth the compensation and noncompensation expenses for the periods indicated 

 

 compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and represents between 50 and 60 of our total operating expenses these expenses generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting increased compensation and benefits expenses for current staff and increased staffing levels compensation and benefits expenses in fiscal 2008 were 1700 million an increase of 359 million or 268 from fiscal 2007 the increase is a result of 248 million of expenses related to the founders grant and 91 million attributable to people hired in connection with replacing services provided by morgan stanley in addition the increase compared to fiscal 2007 reflects higher compensation costs for existing staff and new hires offset in part by the movement of positions from developed market centers to emerging market centers 

expenses related to the founders grant of 256 million in fiscal 2008 and 08 million in fiscal 2007 reflected the amortization of share based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units and options awarded to employees as a onetime grant which became effective in connection with our ipo completed in november 2007 of the 256 million of founders grant expenses in fiscal 2008 79 million was recorded in cost of services and 177 million was recorded in sga in fiscal 2007 02 million was recorded in cost of services and 06 million was recorded in sga 

in fiscal 2007 no stock based compensation was granted to employees in addition to the onetime founders grant in fiscal 2008 we accrued 42 million for stock based compensation to retirement eligible employees 

noncompensation expense for fiscal 2008 increased 193 million to 1251 million compared to fiscal 2007 the change reflects an increase of 175 million related to the replacement of services provided by morgan stanley personnel 29 million of public company expenses and 16 million associated with the may and july secondary equity offerings partially offset by a 81 million reduction in the expense allocation from morgan stanley 

  

information technology costs which include market data amortization of hardware and software products and telecommunications services are also an important part of our expense base 

because compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses in both the costs of services and sga expense categories we discuss our compensation and noncompensation expenses separately in each of these categories other costs associated with the number of employees such as office space and professional services are included in both the cost of services and sga expense categories consistent with the allocation of employees to those respective areas the following table shows operating expenses by each of the categories 

 

 cost of services 

cost of services includes costs related to our research data management and production client service software engineering and product management functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits allocated office space market data fees and certain information technology services provided by morgan stanley the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such they generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation and benefits increases for existing staff and increased staffing levels 

cost of services increased 29 million or 24 to 1247 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 1218 million in fiscal 2007 within cost of services compensation expense increased 71 million to 835 million this increase includes 76 million for the founders grant and higher headcount offset in part by the movement of positions to emerging market centers from developed market centers noncompensation expenses decreased 93 to 412 million due largely to a reduction in the expense allocation from morgan stanley and declines in professional services expenses the expense allocation from morgan stanley decreased 416 to 87 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 150 million in fiscal 2007 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses include compensation and benefits expenses for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology infrastructure and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation as such compensation and benefits expenses generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation and benefits increases for existing staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses are for services provided by morgan stanley and office space 

  

sga expenses increased 546 to 1420 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 918 million in fiscal 2007 excluding the founders grant sga expenses increased 362 to 1243 million in fiscal 2008 compensation and benefits expenses increased 288 million to 866 million the increase is a result of an increase of 171 million for the founders grant and higher headcount partially offset by the movement of positions to emerging market centers from developed market centers noncompensation expenses increased 628 to 554 million primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with the replacement of services provided by morgan stanley within sga selling expenses increased 118 to 486 million in fiscal 2008 and general and administrative expenses increased 932 to 934 million 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles expense relates to the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 at november 30 2008 our intangible assets totaled 1459 million net of accumulated amortization for fiscal 2008 amortization expense totaled 285 million an increase of 21 million compared to fiscal 2007 the increase is due to a reduction in the useful life of our totalrisk product which is consistent with our timeframe to transition totalrisk clients to barraone see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements “intangible assets” for further information 

interest expense income and other net 

interest expense income and other net was an expense of 262 million in fiscal 2008 compared to income of 33 million in fiscal 2007 the 295 million change reflects an increase in interest expense of 173 million primarily related to interest on our term loan borrowings under our credit facility a 50 million decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash balances an increase in foreign currency exchange losses of 37 million due to the impact of the appreciation of the us dollar on our monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than us dollars and a 30 million write off of our investment in alacra inc see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements “long term debt” for further information regarding the credit facility and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements “investment in unconsolidated company” for further information regarding the investment in alacra inc 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes decreased 207 to 414 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of lower pretax income and a decrease in our effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 377 compared to 391 in fiscal 2007 the decrease is primarily due to a 37 million net of federal benefit adjustment to the provision made in fiscal 2007 to record additional tax expense as a result of a settlement between morgan stanley and new york state and new york city tax authorities for the periods 19992007 of which we were allocated a portion of the settlement in addition we recorded a 17 million tax reserve in fiscal 2007 related to open tax years which we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for assessments 

  

results of operations 

fiscal year ended november 30 2007 compared to fiscal year ended november 30 2006 

operating revenues 

 

 revenues increased 592 million or 191 to 3699 million for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 with significant percentage gains across three of our four major product categories the increase reflects increased revenues from equity indices equity portfolio analytics and multiasset class portfolio analytics price increases added very little to our revenue growth 

revenues from equity indices increased 432 million or 276 to 2000 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 approximately 239 million or 553 of the revenue increase was attributable to increases in fees based on assets of investment products linked to msci indices and the balance to additional index subscriptions from existing and new clients growth of assets in etfs linked to our equity indices drove the higher fees we received from assets in investment products the majority of growth in assets under management was the result of increased investment flows into the etfs 

revenues from equity portfolio analytics increased 106 million or 97 to 1206 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase was the result of strong new subscription growth for our equity risk models and related analytics products with a notable increase in demand for our proprietary equity risk data through thirdparty software vendors in addition this increase was due to significantly higher retention rates for barra aegis 

revenues from multiasset class portfolio analytics increased 62 million or 367 to 231 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase primarily reflects additional subscriptions to barraone by asset owners and fund managers with notable strength from emea and the americas the increase in barraone revenue was offset in part by a decline in revenues from totalrisk due to our decision in late 2006 to stop licensing subscriptions to totalrisk 

revenues from other products decreased 09 million or 32 to 262 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the decrease is principally the result of the cancellation of a large fixed income index subscription at the end of first quarter 2007 and decreased revenues from msci hedge fund indices due to declining asset levels of investment products linked to these indices the decrease was mitigated by strong growth in our energy and commodity valuation analytics product subscriptions marketed under the fea brand 

  

operating expenses 

 

 total operating expenses of 2399 million for the fiscal year ended november 30 2007 were 123 million or 54 higher compared to fiscal 2006 excluding the founders grant expense of 08 million operating expenses increased 54 to 2391 million for fiscal 2007 with compensation and benefits expenses increasing 101 and noncompensation expense remaining flat for fiscal 2007 compensation and benefit expenses represented 559 of the total operating expenses compared to 532 in fiscal 2006 excluding expenses related to the founders grant of 08 million and the 97 million of nonrecurring items in 2006 91 million of selling general and administrative expenses which are discussed below expenses for fiscal 2007 increased 104 comprised of compensation and benefits costs increases of 149 and noncompensation expenses increases of 53 compared to fiscal year 2006 

cost of services 

cost of services increased 67 million or 58 to 1218 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the majority of the increase 38 million was driven by increased personnel costs that reflected hires made in the second half of 2006 in the information technology group as well as the hiring of a chief operating officer additional market data costs including costs associated with introducing the gimi methodology rent increases from adding business continuity space in hong kong and london as well as higher allocations of information technology and administrative expenses from morgan stanley were the largest contributors to noncompensation expense growth 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 54 million or 62 to 918 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase was mainly due to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses which increased 93 million or 191 due to the hiring of additional employees in the second half of 2006 and increased compensation and benefits costs for existing personnel overall noncompensation expenses decreased year over year by 39 million or 102 

fiscal 2006 included a number of expense items not repeated in fiscal 2007 which totaled 91 million these nonrecurring expenses included accrued stock based compensation expense for equity awards for retirement eligible employees recruitment fees associated with senior staff additions and acquisition related costs excluding these 91 million of nonrecurring items in 2006 expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by 187 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase included a 307 increase in compensation and benefit expenses and a 28 increase in noncompensation expenses the increase in compensation and benefit expenses was driven by the full year cost in fiscal 2007 related to staff hires made in the second half of 2006 and increased compensation and benefits costs for existing personnel increases in noncompensation costs for fiscal 2007 were due to an increase in the allocation of general and administrative expenses from morgan stanley and travel expenses incurred as a result of the growth of our sales organization 

  

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense increased 02 million or 08 to 264 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a percentage of revenues amortization expense declined to 71 from 84 

interest expense income and other net 

interest expense income and other net decreased 797 to 33 million for fiscal year 2007 the net decrease was the result of an increase in gross interest expense a reduction of gross interest income and foreign currency exchange decrease of 09 million gross interest income decreased as a result of holding substantially lower cash balances resulting from the payment of the 9730 million dividend to morgan stanley and capital group international we experienced higher gross interest expense on account of interest due on the demand note issued to morgan stanley in july 2007 and following repayment of the demand note on borrowings of 4250 million under the credit facility we entered into simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering see “—liquidity and capital resources” below 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes increased 161 million or 446 to 522 million for fiscal 2007 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 increased to 391 from 363 in fiscal 2006 the increase reflects higher taxable earnings and two significant adjustments to the tax provision 

as a result of a settlement entered into by morgan stanley with new york state and new york city tax authorities msci will be included in the combined new york state and new york city income tax returns of morgan stanley through july 21 2008 when filing as a separate taxpayer our new york state and new york city income taxes were lower than when calculated as part of morgan stanley’s combined state and local income tax return over the applicable period consequently we recorded an adjustment of 37 million for tax and interest net of federal tax benefit relating to tax years 1999 through 2007 to reflect the tax settlement 

the other component of the increased income tax provision is the establishment of additional tax reserves of 17 million related to open tax years which we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments 

liquidity and capital resources 

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions we are solely responsible for the provision of funds to finance our working capital and other cash requirements 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under the credit facility we intend to use these sources of liquidity to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments and acquisitions in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth 

as described above in “—factors impacting comparability of our financial results—july 2007 dividend” we paid a dividend of 9730 million consisting of 3250 million in cash and 6480 million of demand notes on july 19 2007 morgan stanley was issued a demand note in the amount of 6259 million and capital group international was issued a demand note in the amount of 221 million on july 19 2007 we paid in full in cash the 221 million demand note held by capital group international 

on november 14 2007 we entered into a secured 5000 million credit facility with morgan stanley senior funding inc and bank of america na as agents for a syndicate of lenders and other lenders party thereto 

  

pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of november 20 2007 the “credit facility” outstanding borrowings under the credit facility initially accrued interest at i libor plus a fixed margin of 250 in the case of the term loan a facility and the revolving credit facility and 300 in the case of the term loan b facility or ii the base rate plus a fixed margin of 150 in the case of the term loan a facility and the revolving credit facility and 200 in the case of the term loan b facility in april 2008 and again in july 2008 the company’s fixed margin rate was reduced by 025 on november 28 2008 the rates were adjusted to 420 and 470 respectively following a libor reset the term loan a facility and the term loan b facility will mature on november 20 2012 and november 20 2014 respectively at november 30 2008 4028 million was outstanding and there was 750 million of unused credit under the revolving credit facility interest is paid quarterly in february may august and november we pay an annual 05 fee on the unused portion of the 750 million revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility is available for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes including the financing of permitted acquisitions subject to certain conditions and matures on november 20 2012 banc of america securities llc and an affiliate of morgan stanley acted as joint lead arrangers for the credit facility 

the credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing or future subsidiaries’ abilities among other things to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed a 37510 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 32510 thereafter and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be a 30010 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 40010 thereafter as of november 30 2008 our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility was 191 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility was 851 

in addition the credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

  

the company has quarterly principal repayment requirements due in february may august and november the term loan a and term loan b payment requirements are described in note 5 “long term debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the final installment of 500 million from term loan a is due november 30 2012 the final installment of 2098 million on term loan b is due november 30 2014 

currently we have 4028 million outstanding under our credit facility and have an additional 750 million available under the revolving credit facility on our balance sheet our debt balances are recorded net of discount 

cash flows 

 

 cash and cash equivalents and cash deposited with related parties 

cash and cash equivalents were 2681 million 338 million and 244 million as of november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively this constituted approximately 265 37 and 22 of total assets as of november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as of november 30 2008 we did not have any cash deposited with morgan stanley prior to july 1 2008 excess cash was deposited with morgan stanley and is shown separately on the balance sheet under cash deposited with related parties cash deposited with related parties was 1376 million and 3302 million as of november 30 2007 and 2006 respectively representing approximately 152 and 297 of total assets respectively our cash including cash equivalents and cash deposited with related parties increased in fiscal 2008 this increase was primarily the result of cash flows from operations partially offset by cash used to purchase property equipment and leasehold improvements repayments of our long term debt obligations and the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2008 we believe that our cash flow from operations including prepaid subscription fees together with existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for capital expenditures and other cash needs for ongoing business operations for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

cash flows from operating activities 

in fiscal 2008 net cash provided by operating activities increased 407 to 1551 million from 1102 million in 2007 the 449 million increase is primarily attributable to an increase in noncash expenses of 571 million partially offset by a decrease in net income of 128 million the increase in noncash expenses includes an increase of 293 million associated with compensation payable in common stock principally founders grant expense lower deferred tax expense of 155 million foreign currency losses of 43 million higher depreciation expense of 35 million a writeoff of alacra of 30 million and an increase in amortization expense of 21 million changes in assets and liabilities relative to the prior year were not significant 

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for payment of cash compensation expenses office rent market data technology costs allocations and replacement of services provided by morgan stanley interest and taxes in the nearterm we expect to meet all interest obligations on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility from cash generated by operations the payment of cash compensation expenses is historically at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities include cash used for capital expenditures and cash deposited with morgan stanley in fiscal 2008 the amount of cash deposited with morgan stanley decreased by 1376 million as a result of the transfer of cash deposited with morgan stanley to accounts at bank of america in connection with our separation capital expenditures totaled 256 million in fiscal 2008 relating primarily to hardware and software associated with building our own information technology infrastructure including data centers as well as buildout costs of leased office space as we continue to replace services provided by morgan stanley we anticipate funding any future capital expenditures out of our operating cash flows 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities largely represent scheduled payments on our outstanding longterm debt in fiscal 2008 of 223 million and for cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 and 2006 of 9730 million and 50 million respectively during fiscal 2008 the net cash used in financing activities was 230 million which largely represents the payment of our longterm debt 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and obligations arising from borrowings under the credit facility the following summarizes our contractual obligations 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

at november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective beginning an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 or upon early adoption of fasb statement no 159 we early adopted fasb statement no 159 as of december 1 2006 and in effect adopted sfas no 157 at the same time accordingly we adopted sfas no 157 on december 1 2006 the adoption of sfas no 157 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” we recorded an after tax charge of 09 million to shareholders’ equity upon adoption of this requirement sfas no 158 also requires the measurement of defined benefit and postretirement plan assets and 

  

obligations as of the end of the fiscal year sfas no 158’s requirement to use the fiscal yearend date as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 we early adopted the measurement date change the impact of this change was immaterial 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “sfas 159” sfas 159 permits entities to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in the fair values of those items unrealized gains and losses recognized in the statement of income for each reporting period under this statement fair value elections can be made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis are irrevocable and can only be made upon specified election date events in addition new disclosure requirements apply with respect to instruments for which fair value measurement is elected we elected to early adopt sfas 159 as of december 1 2006 we chose not to make any fair value elections with respect to any of its eligible assets or liabilities as permitted under the provisions of sfas 159 

in june 2007 the eitf reached consensus on issue no 0611 “accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on sharebased payment awards” eitf issue no 0611 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units that are expected to vest be recorded as an increase to additional paidin capital we currently account for this tax benefit as a reduction to our income tax provision eitf issue no 0611 is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 as we currently have no plans to pay a dividend the adoption of eitf issue no 0611 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 141r “ business combinations ” “sfas no 141r” sfas no 141r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination sfas no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december 1 2009 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “ disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 13 ” “sfas no 161” sfas no 161 establishes among other things the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and for hedging activities sfas no 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in june 2008 the fasb issued fsp eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” “fsp eitf 0361” fsp eitf 0361 addresses whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the twoclass method as described in sfas no 128 “earnings per share” under the guidance in fsp eitf 0361 unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share 

  

pursuant to the twoclass method fsp eitf 0361 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years all priorperiod earnings per share data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively early application is not permitted we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting fsp eitf 0361 

 

 foreign currency risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk exchange rate movements can impact the us dollar reported value of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded 

substantially all of our revenues from our index linked investment products are based on fees earned on the value of assets invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for all operations outside the united states where the company has designated the local nonus dollar currency as the functional currency revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using monthend exchange rates for these operations currency translation adjustments arising from a change in the rate of exchange between the functional currency and the us dollar are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity in addition transaction gains and losses arising from a change in exchange rates for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in other nonoperating income expense 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 726 million or 169 of our operating revenues for fiscal year 2008 while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets substantially all of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of clients in euros pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies approximately 608 million or 141 and 567 million or 153 of our revenues for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 and 2007 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the majority of which were in euros pounds sterling and japanese yen 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs although our expenses are generally in us dollars some of our expenses are incurred in nonus dollar denominated currencies approximately 811 million or 275 and 556 million or 231 of our expenses for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 and 2007 respectively were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in swiss francs pounds sterling hong kong dollars euros and japanese yen expenses paid in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us and replace services provided by morgan stanley which we paid in us dollars 

we have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances were remeasured into their local functional currency a loss resulted from the devaluation of the value of the functional currency as a result of these positions we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of 43 million for fiscal year ended november 30 2008 the 43 million loss was recorded in other expense income in our consolidated statements of income these losses on foreign currency exchange were primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar although we do not currently hedge the foreign exchange risk of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency we are examining ways to minimize exposure by reducing the value of the assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which they reside 

  

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase generally we do not use derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk however we may do so in the future foreign currency cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs 

interest rate sensitivity 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 2681 million 338 million and 244 million at november 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these amounts were held primarily in checking money market accounts in the countries where we maintain banking relationships prior to july 1 2008 the majority of our excess cash was deposited with morgan stanley as of november 30 2008 we did not have any cash deposited with morgan stanley at november 30 2007 and 2006 amounts held with morgan stanley were 1376 million and 3302 million respectively on our statements of financial condition these amounts are shown as “cash deposited with related parties” we received interest at morgan stanley’s internal prevailing rates on these funds the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates declines in interest rates however will reduce future interest income 

borrowings under the credit facility accrued interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus a fixed margin subject to interest rate stepdowns based on the achievement of consolidated leverage ratio conditions as defined in the credit facility on july 8 2008 we met certain conditions as defined in the credit facility and qualified for a tier change resulting in a decrease in the libor fixed margin to 200 for the term loan a facility and 250 for the term loan b facility in the nearterm we expect to pay down the credit facility with cash generated from our ongoing operations 

on february 13 2008 we entered into interest rate swap agreements effective through the end of november 2010 for an aggregate notional principal amount of 2517 million by entering into these agreements we reduced interest rate risk by effectively converting floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt this action reduces our risk of incurring higher interest costs in periods of rising interest rates and improves the overall balance between floating and fixed rate debt the effective fixed rate on the notional principal amount swapped was approximately 531 for the year ended november 30 2008 on november 30 2008 the effective fixed rate on the notional principal amount swapped was 516 these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

changes in libor will affect the interest rate on the portion of our credit facilities which have not been hedged by the interest rate swaps and therefore our costs under the credit facilities assuming an average of 1600 million of variable rate debt outstanding a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in libor for a one year period would result in approximately 16 million of additional interest rate expense 

we recorded a pretax loss in other comprehensive income of 36 million 23 million after tax for the year ended november 30 2008 as a result of the fair value measurement of these swaps the fair value of these swaps is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of november 30 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated statement of financial condition of the company as of november 30 2008 and the related consolidated statements of income comprehensive income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended november 30 2008 and our report dated january 29 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph on the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r”

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers our index and analytics products are dependent upon and of little value without updates from our data suppliers and most of our software products are dependent upon and of little value without continuing access to historical and current data as of november 30 2007 we utilized and distributed certain data provided to us by over 150 data sources including large volumes of data from certain exchanges around the world if the products of our suppliers have errors are delayed have design defects are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and we have not completed formal agreements with all of our data suppliers such as certain exchanges many of these data suppliers compete with one another and to some extent with us from time to time we receive notices from data suppliers 

  

threatening to terminate the provision of their data to us termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although data suppliers and exchanges typically benefit from broad access to their data some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers including with certain exchanges if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors a competitive advantage such exclusive contracts would hinder our ability to provide our clients with the data they prefer which could lead to a decrease in our client base and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

some data suppliers may seek to increase licensing fees for providing their content to us if we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content we may be required to reduce our profit margins or experience a reduction in our market share 

some of our thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

any failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of client data could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

many of our products exchange information with clients through a variety of media including the internet software applications and dedicated transmission lines we rely on a complex network of internal process and software controls to protect the confidentiality of client data such as client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in implementation of our internal controls misappropriation of client data could occur such internal control inadequacies could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have implemented information barrier procedures to protect the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail our reputation could be damaged and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we change the composition of our indices from time to time we believe that in some cases the changes we make to our indices can affect the prices of constituent securities and products based on our indices our index clients rely on us to keep information about changes to the future composition of an index confidential and to protect against the misuse of that information until the change to the composition of the index is disclosed to clients we have implemented information barrier procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information regarding changes to the composition of our indices if our information barrier procedures fail and we inadvertently disclose or an individual deliberately misuses information about a change to one of our indices our reputation may suffer clients’ loss of trust and confidence in our information barrier policies and procedures could lead to a negative reputation throughout the investment community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain exchanges permit our clients to list exchange traded funds or other financial products based on our indices only if we provide a representation to the exchange that we have reasonable information barrier procedures in place to address the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material nonpublic information about changes to the composition of our indices if an exchange determines that our information barrier procedures are not sufficient the exchange might refuse to list or might delist investment products based on our indices which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

legal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and pending thirdparty litigation may adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we consider certain aspects of our products and processes to be proprietary we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret patent copyright and trademark rights as well as contractual protections and technical measures to protect our products and processes despite our efforts third parties may still try to challenge invalidate or circumvent our rights and protections there is no guarantee that any trade secret patent copyright or trademark rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights even if we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation it may require considerable cost time and resources to do so and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore our competitors may also independently develop patent or otherwise protect products and processes that are the same or similar to ours in addition the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us also some elements of our products and processes may not be subject to intellectual property protection 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights businesses operating in the financial services sector including our competitors and potential competitors have in recent years increasingly pursued patent protection for their technologies and business methods if any third parties were to obtain a patent on an index methodology risk model or software application we could be sued for infringement furthermore there is always a risk that third parties will sue us for infringement or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights such as trademarks copyrights or trade secrets 

from time to time we receive such notices from others alleging intellectual property infringement or potential infringement the number of these claims may grow we have made and expect to continue making expenditures related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

responding to intellectual property claims regardless of merit can consume valuable time result in costly litigation or cause delays we may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms and there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation arising from such claims if such claims are not settled we may be required to pay damages required to stop selling or using the affected products or applications or required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements there can be no assurance that any royalty or licensing agreements will be made if at all on terms that are commercially acceptable to us we may also be called upon to defend partners clients suppliers or distributors against such thirdparty claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts therefore the impact of claims of intellectual property infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our use of open source code could impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential 

we rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products as well as to support our internal systems and infrastructure we monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source code licenses however are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us courts accordingly there are risks that there may be a failure in our procedures for controlling the usage of open source code or that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form proprietary code that links to certain open source code modules to reengineer our products or systems or to discontinue the licensing of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are dependent on the use of thirdparty software and data and any reduction in thirdparty product quality or any failure by us to comply with our licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty software and data in connection with our product development and offerings we depend on the ability of thirdparty software and data providers to deliver and support reliable products enhance their current products develop new products on a timely and costeffective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes the thirdparty software and data we use may become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products we also monitor our use of thirdparty software and data to comply with applicable license requirements despite our efforts there can be no assurance that such third parties may not challenge our use resulting in our loss of rights or costly legal actions our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the functionality provided by software or data that becomes unavailable or fails to operate effectively for any reason in addition our operating costs could increase if license fees for thirdparty software or data increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to thirdparty or other software or data are substantial some of these thirdparty suppliers are also our competitors increasing the risks noted above 

if our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operation 

products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing such errors can exist at any point in a product’s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products we continually introduce new products and new versions of our products despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients our current and future products may contain serious defects or malfunctions if we detect any errors before we release a product we might have to delay the product release for an extended period of time while we address the problem we might not discover errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors errors may occur in our products that could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in harm to our reputation lost sales delays in commercial release thirdparty claims contractual disputes negative publicity delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products license terminations or renegotiations or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 

furthermore our clients may use our products together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem even when our products do not cause these problems the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts impact our reputation cause significant client relations problems or result in legal claims against us 

our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in the capital markets particularly the equity capital markets 

clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds and mutual funds commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets these assetbased fees make up a significant and increasing portion of our revenues they were 186 150 and 140 of revenues for the years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively these assetbased fees accounted for 52 45 and 38 of the revenues from our ten largest clients in the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively economic uncertainty and volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product in particular because our international equity indices are constructed from the perspective of an international investor our assetbased fees may decrease if investments are directed away from foreign markets and become focused on domestic markets additionally if the performance of a market and the msci index that tracks that market decline the assets of an investment product based on that index may decline as well each of these factors could result in the fluctuation in or decline in our assetbased fees which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our clients that pay us a fee based on the assets of an investment product may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage or may cease using our indices which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from assetbased fees 

a portion of our revenues are from assetbased fees and these revenues are concentrated in some of our largest clients our clients may seek to negotiate a lower assetbased fee percentage for a variety of reasons as the assets of indexlinked investment products managed by our clients change they may request to pay us lower assetbased fee percentages additionally as competition among our clients increases they may have to lower the fees they charge to their clients which could cause them to try to decrease our fees accordingly for example competition is intense and increasing among our clients that provide exchange traded funds the fees they charge their clients are one of the competitive differentiators for these exchange traded fund managers additionally clients that have licensed our indices to serve as the basis of indexlinked investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indices and could elect to cease offering the product or could change the index to a nonmsci index in which case our assetbased fees could dramatically decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on our clients continuing to invest in equity securities if our clients significantly reduce their investments in equity securities our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the majority of our revenues comes from our products that are focused on various aspects of managing or monitoring equity portfolios to the extent our clients’ investment emphasis significantly changes from equity to fixed income securities or multiasset class or derivative strategies the demand for our equity products would likely decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on our clients continuing to measure the performance of their equity investments against equity benchmarks if our clients discontinue use of equity benchmarks to measure performance our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our equity index products serve as equity benchmarks against which our clients can measure the performance of their investments if clients decide to measure performance on an absolute return basis instead of against an equity benchmark the demand for our indices could decrease any such decrease in demand for our equity index products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments 

the market for our products is characterized by shifting client demands evolving market practices and for some of our products rapid technological change changed client demands new market practices or new technologies can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and respond to technological and market changes we may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing our new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements 

  

a limited number of clients account for a material portion of our revenue cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 revenues from our ten largest clients accounted for 31 31 and 28 of our total revenues respectively if we fail to obtain a significant number of new clients or if one of our largest clients cancels its subscriptions or investment product licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those subscriptions or licenses our business financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected for the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 our largest client organization by revenue barclays plc and affiliates accounted for 126 112 and 77 of our total revenues respectively approximately 915 of the revenue from barclays came from fees based on the assets in barclays’ exchange traded funds based on msci indices 

cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses or renegotiation of terms by a significant number of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary commercial model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at a specified location and by a given number of users for most of our products our clients may cancel their subscriptions or investment product licenses at the end of the current term while we believe this practice supports our marketing efforts by allowing clients to subscribe without the requirement of a longterm commitment the cancellation of subscriptions or investment product licenses by a significant number of clients at any given time may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may become more selfsufficient which may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients may develop independently certain functionality contained in the products they currently license from us for example some of our clients who currently license our risk data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk making our products unnecessary for them to the extent that our clients become more selfsufficient demand for our products may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face competition across all markets for our products our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry to create a singlepurpose product may be low in many cases the internet as a distribution channel has allowed free or relatively inexpensive access to information sources which has reduced barriers to entry even further low barriers to entry could lead to the emergence of new competitors for example brokerdealers and data suppliers could begin developing their own proprietary risk analytics or equity indices these competitive pressures may also result in fewer clients fewer subscriptions or investment product licenses price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

consolidation within our target markets may affect our business 

consolidation in the investment management industry could reduce our existing client base and the number of potential clients this may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth and may reduce demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and we expect this trend to continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources to the extent that our clients choose to use these sources for their information needs our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth during our operating history there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past among other things there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our marketing efforts as we have been in the past or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past for example our attempt to expand our index products to include fixed income indices was not as successful as we anticipated so we decided to terminate our efforts to develop proprietary fixed income indices see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” any failure to continue to grow our business and maintain profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our growth may place significant strain on our management and other resources 

we must plan and manage our growth effectively to increase revenue and maintain profitability our growth has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel management and other resources we must continue to improve our operational financial management legal and compliance processes and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business there can also be no assurance that if we continue to grow internally or by way of acquisitions management will be effective in attracting and retaining additional qualified personnel expanding our physical facilities and information technology infrastructure integrating acquired businesses or otherwise managing growth any failure to effectively manage growth or to effectively manage the business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to address our clients’ changing needs market changes and technological developments” above “—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise” below “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1—business” 

there is considerable risk embedded in growth through acquisitions which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

a principal element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions any future acquisitions could present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses operations or assets or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our future growth business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our revenues and expenses are subject to currency exchange fluctuation risk 

we have two separate exposures to currency exchange fluctuation risk—revenues from indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds and nonus dollar invoiced revenues and expenses 

revenues from indexlinked investment products represented approximately 186 150 and 140 of operating revenues for the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets substantially all of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of our clients in euros pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies for the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 15 17 and 21 respectively of our operating revenues were invoiced in currencies other than us dollars approximately half of our foreign currency revenues were in euros and a quarter in pounds sterling and japanese yen respectively over those periods 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs although our expenses are generally in us dollars some of our expenses are incurred in nonus dollar denominated currencies approximately 556 million or 23 of our expenses for the fiscal year ended november 30 2007 were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in swiss francs pounds sterling hong kong dollars euros and japanese yen expenses incurred in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us and replace services provided by morgan stanley internationally for which we currently pay morgan stanley in us dollars 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase we do not hedge our foreign currencylinked revenue stream to the extent we or morgan stanley attempt to hedge this risk in the future there is no guarantee that any hedging will be fully effective 

changes in government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels as well as by foreign governments it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our clients’ businesses if we fail to comply with any 

  

applicable laws rules or regulations we could be subject to fines or other penalties there can be no assurance that changes in laws rules or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

  

  

 we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

our products support the investment processes of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets our client agreements have provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability 

  

claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our products however these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal state foreign or local laws use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts any such claim even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of november 30 2007 we had 4250 million of indebtedness 4027 million in long term debt and 223 million in current maturities and cash and cash equivalents and cash deposited with related parties of 1714 million 

on november 14 2007 we entered into the 5000 million credit facility see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” and “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” as of november 30 2007 we had 4250 million outstanding under the credit facility 

the credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of the capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing future subsidiaries’ abilities to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness make or hold investments merge dissolve liquidate consolidate with or into another person sell transfer or dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock change the nature of our business enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s length basis except as described in “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” and prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

the credit facility also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis 1 the maximum total leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall not exceed a 37510 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 32510 thereafter and 2 the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility measured quarterly on a rolling fourquarter basis shall be a 30010 through november 30 2009 b 35010 from december 1 2009 through november 30 2010 and c 40010 thereafter 

in addition our credit facility contains the following affirmative covenants among others periodic delivery of financial statements budgets and officer’s certificates payment of other obligations compliance with laws and regulations payment of taxes and other material obligations maintenance of property and insurance performance of material leases right of the lenders to inspect property books and records notices of defaults and other material events and maintenance of books and records 

in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic consequences require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow and proceeds of any additional equity issuances to payments of our indebtedness make it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate place 

  

us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital and capital expenditures limit our ability to consummate acquisitions and increase our interest expense 

we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the development maintenance and support of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management research sales and marketing information technology and other technical personnel although we do not believe that we are dependent upon any individual employee the loss of a group of our key professional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other technical personnel competition for such personnel worldwide is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our products may suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may materially adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we depend heavily on the capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems and the internet heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties operational failures sabotage breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or hacking human error national disasters power loss or computer viruses could cause our systems to operate slowly or interrupt their availability for periods of time our ability to effectively use the internet may be impaired due to infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation if disruptions failures or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the internet occur our ability to distribute our products effectively and to serve our clients may be materially and adversely affected 

catastrophic events could lead to interruptions in our operations which may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations depend on our ability to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against fires earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as power losses computer and telecommunications failures technological breakdowns unauthorized intrusions terrorist attacks on sites where we or our clients are located and other catastrophic events we also depend on accessible office facilities for our employees in order for our operations to function properly there is no assurance that the business continuity measures we have taken to reduce the risk of interruption in our operations caused by these events will be sufficient 

such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example immediately after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional products in addition delivery of some of the data we receive from new yorkbased suppliers was delayed the grounding of air transportation impaired our ability to conduct sales visits and other meetings at client sites during the resulting temporary closure of the us stock markets some of the data updates supporting our products were interrupted these types of interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

although we currently estimate that the total cost of developing and implementing our business continuity measures will not have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot provide any assurance that our estimates regarding the timing and cost of implementing these measures will be accurate 

we are subject to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways 

we are subject to political economic legal operational franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries including risks of possible capital controls exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 

risks related to our relationship with morgan stanley 

morgan stanley owns a controlling interest in our company and the interests of morgan stanley may conflict with ours and with those of our other shareholders 

as of november 30 2007 morgan stanley owned approximately 966 of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock which represents approximately 9302 of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b common stock generally has five votes per share other than with respect to a limited number of matters specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation such as approval of transactions by which a thirdparty might acquire control of us as of november 30 2007 holders of shares of class b common stock collectively control approximately 963 of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock except when amending or altering any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws so as to adversely affect the rights of the other class for example the holders of shares of class b common stock substantially all of which is held by morgan stanley are able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors who determine our strategic plans approve major financing decisions and appoint top management in addition as a holder of substantially all of our class b common stock morgan stanley may seek to cause us to take courses of action that in its judgment could enhance its investment in us but which might involve risks to holders of our class a common stock or adversely affect us or other investors because morgan stanley’s interests as our controlling shareholder may differ from other investors’ interests actions taken by morgan stanley with respect to us may not be favorable to other investors 

we have also entered into a services agreement and a number of other agreements with morgan stanley setting forth various matters governing our relationship with morgan stanley while it remains a significant shareholder in us for a description of these agreements see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” these agreements govern the provision of corporate services to us and are likely to affect our ability to make certain acquisitions or to merge or consolidate or to sell all or substantially all our assets the rights of morgan stanley under these agreements may allow morgan stanley to delay or prevent an acquisition of us or prevent a redemption or repurchase of our common stock that our other shareholders including you may consider favorable we may not be able to terminate these agreements or amend them in a manner we deem more favorable except in accordance with their terms 

  

conflicts of interest may arise between morgan stanley and us that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us 

questions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between morgan stanley and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships areas in which conflicts of interest between morgan stanley and us could arise include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

 our cost of funding will increase and our liquidity will decrease 

we have lower credit ratings and are expected to have more constrained liquidity than our current principal shareholder morgan stanley currently morgan stanley maintains a contingency funding plan to manage a potential prolonged liquidity contraction over a oneyear time period and to provide the ability to conduct business in an orderly manner as part of morgan stanley our liquidity needs are included in this plan as a standalone company we will need to manage our liquidity needs independent of morgan stanley we may face 

  

challenges in maintaining equivalent liquidity reserves and securing access to contingent funding we may also face additional challenges in the future including more limited capital resources to invest in or expand our business see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” 

our historical financial results are derived from our results as a subsidiary of morgan stanley and include allocated costs for functions historically provided by morgan stanley and therefore may not be representative of our results as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented and may not be indicative of the results we will achieve in the future as a standalone public company the historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by morgan stanley including portions of human resources information technology accounting legal and compliance tax office space leasing corporate services and treasury these allocations were based on what we and morgan stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in support of our business the historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations financial condition cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future or that our costs as a standalone company will be similar for additional information see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “item 6—selected consolidated financial data” and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we completed our initial public offering in november 2007 and our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we do not quickly and cost effectively establish our own financial administrative and other support functions to operate as a standalone company or if we are unable to replace the corporate services morgan stanley provides us in a timely manner or on comparable terms 

historically we have relied on certain financial administrative and other resources of morgan stanley to operate our business both domestically and internationally we completed our initial public offering in november 2007 and as a result of our initial public offering we will need to enhance certain financial legal and compliance administrative information technology and other support systems and processes or contract with third parties to replace morgan stanley’s systems 

morgan stanley has performed many important corporate functions for our operations including certain human resources information technology accounting legal and compliance office space leasing corporate services and treasury functions for the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 cost allocations related to these services were 264 million 231 million and 200 million respectively we have entered into a services agreement with morgan stanley pursuant to which morgan stanley will continue to provide some of these services to us for so long as morgan stanley owns more than 50 of our outstanding common stock the services morgan stanley will continue to provide upon owning 50 or less of our outstanding common stock are subject to renegotiation in good faith and will be provided for a period not to exceed 12 months 

it is expected for so long as morgan stanley owns more than 50 of our common stock that compensation for services under the services agreement with morgan stanley will be determined consistent with past practices using an internal cost allocation methodology based on fully loaded cost  ie  allocated direct costs of providing the services plus all related overhead and outofpocket costs and expenses as well as the portion of compensation related expenses for morgan stanley senior executives as allocated to us see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” for a description of these arrangements upon the sale or other disposition of any portion of our business assets or properties morgan stanley’s obligation to provide any service in respect of such disposed business assets or properties will terminate similarly if our business increases significantly or we acquire any business assets or properties morgan stanley will not have to 

  

provide any services in respect of such increase or acquired business assets or properties these services may not be sufficient to meet our needs and after these agreements with morgan stanley terminate we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at acceptable prices and terms any failure or significant downturn in our own financial or administrative policies and systems or in morgan stanley’s financial or administrative policies and systems during the term of the services agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

although morgan stanley will be contractually obligated to provide us with services during the term of the services agreement we may not be able to obtain services of similar scope and quality after the expiration or termination of that agreement in addition our costs of procuring those services from third parties may increase see “item 1—business—arrangements between morgan stanley and us” furthermore we may face certain difficulties in operating our business if we are no longer able to rely on morgan stanley’s presence and established services 

in connection with our initial public offering we entered into agreements with morgan stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters that may be on terms less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with another party and we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other things certain past present and future liabilities related to our business 

in connection with our initial public offering we entered into agreements with morgan stanley relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters while still a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley accordingly the terms of these agreements may not reflect those that would have been reached with another party on an arm’slength basis if these agreements were entered into with another party we may have obtained more favorable terms 

pursuant to certain of these agreements we agreed to indemnify morgan stanley for among other matters certain past present and future liabilities related to our business such liabilities include certain unknown liabilities which could be significant 

we may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in the purchasing power and other operational efficiencies we have had due to our association with morgan stanley 

we have been able to take advantage of morgan stanley’s purchasing power in the us and internationally in procuring goods technology and services including insurance employee benefit support and audit services as a standalone company we may be unable to obtain goods technology and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to becoming a standalone company which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally if we are unable to continue to file combined returns with morgan stanley our tax liability may also increase due to increased income taxes in the jurisdictions where combined filings were previously made with morgan stanley 

further morgan stanley has been influential in our ability to attract and retain research sales and marketing information technology software engineering and other personnel as a standalone company it may be more difficult and costly for us to attract and retain such personnel the development maintenance support and use of our products is dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see “—risks related to our business—we are dependent on key personnel in our professional staff for their expertise if we fail to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected” above 

  

we may experience a loss in the marketing and reputational value we currently have due to our association with the morgan stanley name 

we believe we have received marketing and reputational benefits from our association with the morgan stanley brand name as a standalone company that may no longer be the case consequently our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients and our reputation may be adversely affected 

the obligations associated with being a public company will require significant resources and management attention 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting all of the procedures and practices required as a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley were previously established but we will have additional procedures and practices to establish as a standalone public company as a result we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur furthermore the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our growth strategy which could prevent us from improving our business results of operations and financial condition we have made and will continue to make changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a standalone public company however the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company in addition we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting starting with the second annual report that we file with the sec and will likely require in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanesoxley act for compliance with the requirements of section 404 we will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with section 404 in addition failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements 

morgan stanley continues to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards under the new york stock exchange rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by another company is a “controlled company” and need not comply with certain requirements including 1 the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 the requirement that the nominatingcorporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 3 the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 4 the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees we intend to utilize these exemptions as a result we will not have a majority of independent directors nor will our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors accordingly shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements 

  

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

because holders of the shares of class b common stock will control the majority of the voting power of all classes of voting stock other shareholders will not be able to determine the outcome of shareholder votes 

holders of our class a common stock have one vote per share and holders of our class b common stock generally have five votes per share other than with respect to a limited number of matters specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation such as approval of transactions by which a thirdparty might acquire control of us holders of shares of class b common stock collectively control 9677 of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock other than with respect to those matters for example the holders of shares of class b common stock are able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors who determine our strategic plans including certain acquisitions approve major financing decisions and appoint top management in addition the holders of the class b common stock may seek to cause us to take courses of action that in their judgment could enhance their investment in us but which might involve risks to holders of our class a common stock or adversely affect us or other investors substantially all of the class b common stock are beneficially owned by morgan stanley and class b shares are only transferable to morgan stanley capital group international or one of their subsidiaries or affiliates any such shares of class b common stock transferred to a person other than morgan stanley capital group international or one of their subsidiaries or affiliates automatically convert into one share of class a common stock upon such disposition except for a disposition effected in connection with a distribution of class b common stock in a taxfree spinoff morgan stanley may in the future decide to distribute all or a portion of its interest in the class b common stock to its shareholders or securityholders through a taxfree spinoff following any such disposition shares of class b common stock will no longer be convertible into shares of class a common stock and will be transferable as class b common stock retaining their rights to multiple votes per share 

if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our class a common stock the price of our class a common stock could decline 

the trading market for our class a common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for you 

for example some of the factors that may cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our class a common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress our class a common stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock this would include sales by morgan stanley and restricted shares of class a common stock and options to purchase shares of class a common stock granted in connection with our initial public offering and pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plan in connection with our initial public offering we our executive officers certain of our directors and morgan stanley and capital group international agreed with the underwriters not to offer sell dispose of or hedge any shares of our class a common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock including shares of our class b common stock subject to specified limited exceptions and extensions during the period ending 180 days subject to extension after the date of november 14 2007 except with the prior written consent of morgan stanley  co incorporated of the outstanding shares all of the shares of class a common stock and all of the shares of class b common stock will be freely tradable after the expiration date of the lockup agreements excluding any shares acquired by persons who may be deemed to be our affiliates all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock will be eligible for conversion and resale after the expiration of the lockup period shares of our common stock held by our affiliates will continue to be subject to the volume and other restrictions of rule 144 under the us securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act morgan stanley  co incorporated may in its sole discretion and at any time without notice release all or any portion of the shares of our common stock subject to the lockup 

in addition we filed a registration statement registering under the securities act the 12500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of incentive awards to our officers and certain of our employees pursuant to the msci 2007 equity incentive compensation plan and the 500000 shares of class a common stock reserved for issuance in respect of equity awards made to our directors who are not employees of the company or morgan stanley pursuant to the 2007 msci independent directors’ equity compensation plan 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our class a common stock 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our class a common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

 generally the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by our board of directors and a majority vote of shareholders any amendment to our bylaws requires the approval of either a majority of our board of directors or holders of at least 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding capital stock in the election of our board of directors 

moreover we have opted out of the “business combination” provisions of section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware the “dgcl” until such time as morgan stanley ceases to own more than 50 of our outstanding common stock after which we will be governed by these provisions section 203 prohibits a person who acquires more than 15 but less than 85 of all classes of our outstanding voting stock without the approval of our board of directors from merging or combining with us for a period of three years unless the merger or combination is approved by a twothirds vote of the shares not owned by such person these provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our class a common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of our company thereby reducing the likelihood that investors could receive a premium for your class a common stock in an acquisition 

we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth including growth through acquisitions the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements business conditions corporate law requirement and other factors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those identified below and those discussed in “item 1a—risk factors” 

overview 

we are a leading provider of investment decision support tools to investment institutions worldwide we produce indices and risk and return portfolio analytics for use in managing investment portfolios our products are used by institutions investing in or trading equity fixed income and multiasset class instruments and portfolios around the world our flagship products are our international equity indices marketed under the msci brand and our equity portfolio analytics marketed under the barra brand our products are used in many areas of the investment process including for portfolio construction and optimization performance benchmarking and attribution risk management and analysis indexlinked investment product creation asset allocation investment manager selection and investment research 

our clients include asset owners such as pension funds endowments foundations central banks and insurance companies institutional and retail asset managers such as managers of pension assets mutual funds etfs hedge funds and private wealth and financial intermediaries such as brokerdealers exchanges custodians and investment consultants we have a client base of over 2900 clients across 66 countries as of november 30 2007 we had 19 offices in 15 countries to help serve our diverse client base with approximately 53 of our clients in the americas 33 in emea 8 in japan and 6 in asiapacific not including japan based on fiscal year 2007 revenues 

we sell our products through a common sales force produce them on common data and systems platforms and develop them in our global research and product management organizations in evaluating our results we focus on revenues and revenue growth by product category and operating margins encompassing the entire cost structure supporting all our operations our current financial focus is on accelerating our revenue growth to generate cash flow to expand our market position and capitalize on the many growth opportunities before us our revenue growth strategy includes a expanding and deepening our relationships with the large and increasing number of investment institutions worldwide b developing new and enhancing existing equity product offerings as well as further developing and growing our investment tools for multiasset class and fixed income investment institutions and c actively seeking to acquire products technologies and companies that will enhance complement or expand our client base and our product offerings see “item 1—business—growth strategy” 

to maintain and accelerate our revenue and operating income growth we will continue to invest in and expand our operating functions and infrastructure including new sales and client support staff and facilities in locations around the world additional staff and supporting technology for our research and our data management and production functions and additional personnel and supporting technology in our general and administrative functions particularly finance and human resources personnel required to operate as a standalone public company at the same time managing and controlling our operating expenses is very important to us and a distinct part of our culture over time our goal is to keep the rate of growth of our operating expenses below the rate of growth of our revenues allowing us to expand our operating margins however at times because of significant market opportunities it may be more important to us to invest in our business in order to support increased efforts to attract new clients and to develop new product offerings rather than emphasize shortterm operating margin expansion furthermore in some periods our operating expense growth may exceed our operating revenue growth due to the variability of revenues from licensing our equity indices as the basis of etfs 

  

we experienced growth in both revenues and expenses during fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 strong revenue growth continued in equity index products during all three periods acceleration of revenue growth in equity portfolio analytics products during fiscal 2007 resulted in part from investments made during 2006 to enhance and add features to our barra aegis and equity models direct product offerings investments made in barraone in 2006 contributed to growth in revenues in our multiasset class portfolio analytics products from additional subscriptions during fiscal 2007 

our net income disclosed in this annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2007 which is 811 million 096 per diluted share is lower than the net income we disclosed in our earnings release dated january 10 2008 which was 871 million 103 per diluted share this reduction in net income is due to an increased income tax provision that is composed primarily of two parts the majority reflects increased taxes for the period 1999 through 2007 as a result of a recent settlement entered into by morgan stanley with new york state and new york city tax authorities as it relates to us the settlement requires morgan stanley to include us in its combined new york state and city tax returns for the period 1999 through 2007 when filing as a separate taxpayer our new york state and new york city income taxes were lower than when calculated as part of morgan stanley’s combined state and local income tax return over the applicable period consequently we recorded an adjustment of 37 million for tax and interest net of federal tax benefit relating to tax years 1999 through 2007 to reflect the additional taxes owed in future periods we expect our effective tax rate to be marginally higher due to filing a combined new york state and new york city income tax return with our parent morgan stanley 

the other component of the increased income tax provision is the establishment of additional tax reserves of 17 million related to the potential disallowance of certain research and experimental tax credits previously allocated to us 

product enhancements continued throughout 2007 and included the releases of aegis 41 barraone 19 and the introduction of the msci global investable market indices “gimi” methodology 

the higher operating expenses during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to increased compensation and benefit expenses for existing personnel as well as an increase in compensation and benefit expenses related to staff additions that were made during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 

key financial metrics and drivers 

revenues 

our principal sales model is to license annual recurring subscriptions to our products for use at specified locations by a given number of client users for an annual fee paid upfront the substantial majority of our revenues come from these annual recurring subscriptions these fees are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated statement of financial condition and are recognized each month on our income statement as the service is rendered over time as their needs evolve our clients often add product modules users and locations to their subscriptions which results in an increase in our revenues per client additionally a rapidly growing source of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as etfs passive mutual funds and structured products these clients commonly pay us a license fee based on the investment product’s assets 

we group our revenues into the following four product categories 

equity indices 

this category includes fees from msci equity index data subscriptions fees based on assets in investment products linked to our equity indices fees from onetime licenses of our equity index historical data and fees from custom msci indices we also generate a limited amount of revenues based on the trading volume of futures and options contracts linked to our indices 

  

clients typically subscribe to equity index data modules for use by a specified number of users at a particular location clients may select delivery from us or delivery via a thirdparty vendor we are able to grow our revenues for data subscriptions by expanding the number of client users and their locations and the number of thirdparty vendors the client uses for delivery of our data modules the increasing scope and complexity of a client’s data requirements beyond standard data modules such as requests for historical data or customized indices also provide opportunities for further revenue growth from an existing client 

revenues from our indexlinked investment product licenses such as etfs increase or decrease as a result of changes in value of the assets in the investment products these changes in the value of the assets in the investment products can result from equity market price changes and investment inflows and outflows in most cases fees for these licenses are paid quarterly in arrears and are calculated by multiplying a negotiated basis point fee times the average daily assets in the investment product for the most recent period 

equity portfolio analytics 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barra aegis and our proprietary risk data in it equity models direct products and our proprietary equity risk data incorporated in thirdparty software application offerings  eg  barra on vendors 

barra aegis has many uses including portfolio risk analysis and forecasting optimization and factorbased portfolio performance attribution a base subscription for use in portfolio analysis typically involves a subscription to barra aegis and various risk data modules a client may add portfolio performance attribution optimization tools process automation tools or other features to its barra aegis subscription by licensing the client to receive additional software modules and risk data or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can increase our revenues per client further 

our equity models direct risk data is distributed directly to clients who then combine it with their own software applications or upload the risk data onto thirdparty applications a base subscription to our equity models direct product provides equity risk data for a single country for a set fee that authorizes two users by licensing the client to receive equity risk model data for additional countries or increasing the number of permitted client users or client locations we can further increase our revenues per client 

the barra on vendors product makes our proprietary risk data from our equity models direct product available to clients via third party providers such as factset research systems inc 

multiasset class portfolio analytics 

this category includes revenues from annual recurring subscriptions to barraone and barra totalrisk together with our proprietary risk data for multiple asset classes currently we are actively selling subscriptions only to barraone and related risk data once most of the features and functionality of totalrisk have been added to barraone we plan to decommission totalrisk as this happens we will offer our totalrisk clients the opportunity to transition to barraone therefore as this transition takes place revenues from this product group will increasingly come from barraone partially offset by declines in revenues from totalrisk 

other products 

this category includes revenues from a number of products including barra cosmos for fixed income analytics msci hedge fund indices barra hedge fund risk model and fea energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products 

  

run rate 

at the end of any period we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of our total revenues for the following 12 months we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as our “run rate” the run rate at a particular point in time represents the forwardlooking fees for the next 12 months from all subscriptions and investment product licenses we currently provide to our clients under renewable contracts assuming all contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming thencurrent exchange rates for any license whose fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume the run rate calculation reflects an annualization of the most recent periodic fee earned under such license the run rate does not include fees associated with “onetime” and other nonrecurring transactions in addition we remove from the run rate the fees associated with any subscription or investment product license agreement with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or nonrenewal at the time we receive such notice even if the notice is not effective until a later date 

because the run rate represents potential future fees there is typically a delayed impact on our operating revenues from changes in our run rate in addition the actual amount of revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from the run rate because of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the following table sets forth our run rate as of the dates indicated and the percentage growth over the prior period 

 

  

  changes in run rate between periods reflect increases from new subscriptions decreases from cancellations increases or decreases as the case may be from the change in the value of assets of investment products linked to msci indices the change in trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to msci indices price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates

because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues another key metric is our “retention rate” our retention rate for any period represents the percentage of the run rate as of the beginning of the period that is not cancelled during the period the retention rate is computed on a productbyproduct basis therefore if a client reduces the number of products to which it subscribes or switches between our products we treat it as a cancellation in addition we treat any reduction in fees resulting from renegotiated contracts as a cancellation in the calculation to the extent of the reduction we do not calculate retention rates for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in investment products linked to our indices or to trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indices retention rates for a nonannual period are annualized 

the following table sets forth our aggregate retention rate as of the dates indicated 

 

 in recent years on average approximately 40 of our subscription cancellations have occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result retention rates are generally higher during the first three fiscal quarters and lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 

expenses 

compensation and benefits expenses represent the majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions and typically represent 50 to 60 of our total operating expenses these expenses generally contribute to the majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting current staff compensation and benefit increases and increased staffing levels continued growth of our staff in lower cost locations around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefit expenses an important location for us is mumbai india where we have increased our staff levels significantly since commencing our operations there in early 2004 with a small staff in data management and production subsequently we expanded the scale of our operations there by adding teams in research and administration as well as by continuing to expand the data management and production team our office in mumbai has grown from 12 employees as of november 30 2004 to 61 fulltime employees as of november 30 2007 another important location for us in the future is budapest hungary where we opened an office in august 2007 we plan to develop this location as an important information technology and software engineering center our budapest office had six employees as of november 30 2007 

another significant expense for us is services provided by our principal shareholder morgan stanley as a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley we have relied on morgan stanley to provide a number of administrative support services and facilities although we will continue to operate under a services agreement with morgan stanley the amount and composition of our expenses may vary from historical levels as we replace these services with ones supplied by us or by third parties we are investing in expanding our own administrative functions including finance legal and compliance and human resources as well as information technology infrastructure to replace services currently provided by morgan stanley because of initial setup costs and overlaps with services currently provided by morgan stanley our expenses may increase in the nearterm we will incur additional costs as a public company including directors’ compensation audit listing fees investor relations stock administration and regulatory compliance costs 

information technology costs which include market data amortization of hardware and software products and telecommunications services are also an important part of our expense base 

  

we group our expenses into three categories 

 

  

  

 in both the cost of services and sga expense categories compensation and benefits represent the majority of our expenses other costs associated with the number of employees such as office space and professional services are included in both the cost of services and sga expense categories consistent with the allocation of employees to those respective areas 

cost of services 

this category includes costs related to our research data management and production software engineering and product management functions costs in these areas include staff compensation and benefits allocated office space market data fees and certain information technology services provided by morgan stanley the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such they generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation and benefits increases for current staff and increased staffing levels 

selling general and administrative 

this category includes compensation expense for our sales and marketing staff and our finance human resources legal and compliance information technology infrastructure and corporate administration personnel as with cost of services the largest expense in this category is compensation and benefits as such they generally contribute to a majority of our expense increases from period to period reflecting compensation and benefits increases for current staff and increased staffing levels other significant expenses are for services provided by morgan stanley and office space 

amortization of intangible assets 

this category consists of expenses related to amortizing intangible assets arising from the acquisition of barra in june 2004 at the time of acquisition the intangible assets had weighted average useful lives ranging from 15 to 215 years our intangible assets consist primarily of technology and software trademarks and client relationships at november 30 2007 our intangible assets totaled 1744 million net of accumulated amortization for the fiscal year ended november 30 2007 amortization expenses related to intangibles amounted to 264 million and represented more than 10 of our total operating expenses of 2405 million we believe that this is a substantially higher percentage than for other companies in our industry this difference is directly linked to the substantial intangible amortization expense arising from our acquisition of barra 

interest and other income net 

this category consists primarily of interest we collect on cash balances including cash deposited with morgan stanley less interest we pay on payables to related parties as well as interest on our credit facility entered into november 14 2007 for the fiscal year ending november 30 2007 interest and other income net also includes interest incurred on the demand note payable to morgan stanley all outstanding balances on the demand note were paid as of november 20 2007 average cash balances and the weighted average yield received are the two largest factors causing changes in interest income from period to period as a result of the payment in cash and the demand notes associated with the 9730 million dividend paid on july 19 2007 described below under “—factors impacting comparability of our financial results—july 2007 dividend” and our credit facility we expect interest income to be substantially lower and interest expense to be substantially higher in future periods 

  

factors impacting comparability of our financial results 

our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or with our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below 

barra acquisition and divestiture of posit jv 

on june 3 2004 morgan stanley completed the acquisition of barra on december 1 2004 morgan stanley contributed barra to us the contribution of barra was accounted for as a transfer of net assets between entities under common control and therefore we have presented our financial position and results of operations as if barra had been combined with us from the date of the acquisition founded in 1975 barra became a public company in 1991 trading on the nasdaq under the ticker symbol barz 

on february 1 2005 we sold for 900 million our 50 interest in posit jv a joint venture that owned the intellectual property for and certain licenses underlying the posit equity crossing system that matches institutional buyers and sellers to our joint venture partner itg we recorded a pretax gain of 68 million at the time of sale we acquired the posit jv interest as part of our acquisition of barra as part of the sale agreement we were entitled to additional royalties for a period of 10 years subsequent to the sale pursuant to an earnout arrangement based on fees earned by itg related to the posit system in september 2006 itg exercised its option to accelerate the earnout period by making a lump sum payment to us of 117 million in addition we received royalty payments of 32 million and 10 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006 respectively prior to the lump sum earnout payment with the issuance of fasb interpretation 46r consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46r barra determined that posit jv qualified as a variable interest entity barra was entitled to 95 of the gains and losses of the joint venture and thus consolidated posit jv we accounted for the results of operations of posit jv the gain on sale of posit jv and the lump sum payment from itg as discontinued operations in our financial statements 

our relationship with morgan stanley 

our consolidated financial statements have been derived from the financial statements and accounting records of morgan stanley using the historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities of our business the historical costs and expenses reflected in our audited consolidated financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by morgan stanley including human resources information technology accounting legal and compliance tax office space leasing corporate services treasury and other services on november 20 2007 we entered into a services agreement with morgan stanley pursuant to which morgan stanley and its affiliates agreed to provide us with certain of these services for so long as morgan stanley owns more than 50 of our outstanding common stock and for periods varying for different services of up to 12 months thereafter for the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 direct cost allocations related to these services were 264 million 231 million and 200 million respectively these allocations were based on what we and morgan stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization levels of these services required in support of our business and are based on methods that include direct time tracking headcount inventory metrics and corporate overhead the historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations financial condition or cash flows will be in the future 

as we replace services currently provided by morgan stanley our expenses may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in the consolidated statements of income pursuant to the services agreement morgan stanley and its affiliates agreed to provide us with services including certain human resources information technology accounting legal and compliance tax office space leasing corporate services treasury and other services payment for these services will be determined consistent with past practices using an internal cost allocation methodology based on fully loaded cost  ie  allocated direct costs of providing the services plus all related overhead and outofpocket costs and expenses we are currently enhancing our own financial administrative and other support systems or contracting with third parties to replace morgan stanley’s systems we are also establishing our own accounting and internal auditing functions separate from those provided to us by morgan stanley 

  

public company expenses 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act all of the procedures and practices required as a majorityowned subsidiary of morgan stanley were previously established but we continue to add procedures and practices required as a public company as a result we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur 

july 2007 dividend and credit facility 

on july 19 2007 we paid a dividend of 9730 million consisting of 3250 million in cash and 6480 million of demand notes morgan stanley was issued a demand note in the amount of 6259 million and capital group international was issued a demand note in the amount of 221 million on july 19 2007 we paid in full the 221 million demand note held by capital group international 

on november 14 2007 we entered into the 500 million credit facility as discussed below of which we borrowed 4250 million to pay a portion of the 6259 million demand note held by morgan stanley the balance of the demand note was repaid with proceeds from our initial public offering see “—liquidity and capital resources” below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the credit facility 

as a result of this dividend we expect interest income to be substantially lower and interest expense to be substantially higher in future periods 

founders grant 

on november 6 2007 our board of directors approved the award of founders grants to our employees in the form of restricted stock units andor options the aggregate value of the grants which were made on november 14 2007 was approximately 680 million of restricted stock units and options the restricted stock units and options vest over a fouryear period with 50 vesting on the second anniversary of the grant date and 25 vesting on the third and fourth anniversary of the grant date the options have an exercise price per share of 1800 and have a term of ten years subject to earlier cancellation in certain circumstances the aggregate value of the options is calculated using the blackscholes valuation method consistent with statement of financial accounting standards no 123r 

the pretax expense of the founders grant for 2007 was approximately 11 million prior to any estimated or actual forfeitures after estimated forfeitures the pretax expense of the founders grant for 2007 was 08 million the anticipated pretax expense of the founders grant is approximately 269 million 262 million 97 million and 41 million for the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 respectively prior to any estimated or actual forfeitures 

share reclassification 

on october 24 2007 our board of directors approved the amended and restated certificate of incorporation which included i authority to issue 850000000 shares of stock consisting of 500000000 shares of class a common stock par value 001 per share 250000000 shares of class b common stock par value 001 per share and 100000000 shares of preferred stock par value 001 per share and ii a reclassification of each share of our outstanding common stock into 2861235208 shares of class b common stock all per share computations included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the reclassification 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition research and development and software capitalization allowance for doubtful accounts tax contingencies impairment of longlived assets and accrued compensation if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail the results could be materially different from our reported results 

revenue recognition 

revenue related to our nonsoftwarerelated recurring arrangements is recognized pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force 0021 “eitf 0021” “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables ” under eitf 0021 transactions with multiple elements should be considered separate units of accounting if all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

 we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for these products include provisions that among other things allow clients for no additional fee to receive updates and modifications that may be made from time to time for the term of the agreement typically one year as we currently do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of this element of the transaction we do not account for the delivered item as a separate element accordingly we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

our softwarerelated recurring revenue arrangements do not require significant modification or customization of any underlying software applications being licensed accordingly we recognize software revenues excluding the energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products pursuant to the requirements of statement of position “sop” 972 “ software revenue recognition ” as amended by sop 989 “ modification of sop 972  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions ” in accordance with sop 972 we begin to recognize revenues from subscriptions maintenance and client technical support and professional services when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence of a legally binding arrangement 2 delivery has occurred 3 client fee is deemed fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

we have signed subscription agreements with all of our clients that set forth the fees paid to us by the clients further we regularly assess the receivable balances for each client our subscription agreements for software products include provisions that among other things would allow clients to receive unspecified future software upgrades for no additional fee as well as the right to use the software products with maintenance for the term of the agreement typically one year as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” for these elements except for the support related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we do not account for these elements separately accordingly except for revenues related to energy and commodity asset valuation products we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement 

  

our software license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions such provisions generally allow a client to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision we do not record subscription revenues until the earlier of the receipt of a written client acceptance or if not notified by the client that it is cancelling the license agreement the expiration of the acceptance period 

for our energy and commodity asset valuation analytics products we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists in virtually all of our contracts the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support the fair value of support is determined based upon what the fees for the support are for clients who purchase support separately under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue support fees for these products are recognized ratably over the support period 

we apply staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” revenue recognition  in determining revenue recognition related to clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts these clients commonly pay us a fee based on the investment product’s assets under management or contract volumes these fees are calculated based upon estimated assets in the investment product or contract volumes obtained either through independent thirdparty sources or the most recently reported information of the client 

we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

 we have signed contracts with all clients that use our indices as the basis for certain indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds or futures contracts the contracts state the terms under which these fees are to be calculated these fees are billed in arrears after the fees have been earned the fees are earned as we supply the indices to the client we assess the creditworthiness of these clients prior to entering into a contract and regularly review the receivable balances related to them 

research and development and software capitalization 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs sfas no 2 and sfas no 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed sfas no 86 sfas no 2 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred sfas no 86 specifies that costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material and accordingly we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred research and development costs for the fiscal years ended november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 were approximately 570 million 554 million and 483 million respectively 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when it is probable and estimable that a receivable will not be collected the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately 16 million at each of november 30 2007 and 2006 and 11 million at november 30 2005 changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts from november 30 2005 to november 30 2007 were as follows 

 

 tax contingencies 

our taxable income historically has been included in the consolidated us federal income tax return of morgan stanley and in returns filed by morgan stanley with certain state taxing jurisdictions our foreign income tax returns have been filed on a separate company basis our federal and foreign income tax liability has been computed and presented in the consolidated financial statements as if we were a separate taxpaying entity in the periods presented the state and local tax liability presented in these statements reflects the fact that we are included in certain state unitary filings of morgan stanley and that our tax liability is affected by the attributions of the unitary group we will continue to file federal income tax returns with morgan stanley on such basis for so long as morgan stanley owns at least 80 of the total voting power of our stock and 80 of the total value of our stock and will generally continue to file certain state income tax returns with morgan stanley on a consolidated combined or unitary basis under applicable state law until we are no longer permitted to do so if morgan stanley’s ownership of our common stock falls below the relevant threshold which may occur as a result of among other things a subsequent sale or taxfree spinoff by morgan stanley of our common stock we will file the relevant federal or state income tax return as a separate taxable group as a standalone taxpayer our state and local tax filings will reflect our separate filing attributes 

although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed in this annual report on form 10k are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets and identifiable definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows a loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the fair value to date we have not recognized any impairment loss for longlived assets changes to the expected period in which the intangible asset will be utilized changes in forecasted cash flow changes in technology or client demand could materially impact the value of these assets in the future 

as part of a product review on july 15 2007 we decided to transition certain clients over the next two to three years from barra totalrisk to barraone and other products at the end of the transition totalrisk will no longer be offered we have performed an impairment test in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 we have determined there is no impairment 

  

of this asset in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 the remaining useful life of the asset will be shortened from fourandahalf years to twoandahalf years the revised useful life will result in higher amortization expenses related to this asset of 35 million for each of the fiscal years ended november 30 2008 and 2009 

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our quarterly accrued nonstock based compensation expense a significant portion of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary each yearend we determine the amount of discretionary cash bonus pools we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations we take these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate changes to these factors could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of expense that we report in a particular period accrued non stockbased compensation and related benefits as of november 30 2007 was 509 million 

results of operations 

fiscal year ended november 30 2007 compared to fiscal year ended november 30 2006 

revenues 

 

 revenues increased 592 million or 191 to 3699 million for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 with significant percentage gains across three of our four major product categories the increase reflects increased revenues from equity indices equity portfolio analytics and multiasset class portfolio analytics price increases added very little to our revenue growth 

revenues from equity indices increased 432 million or 276 to 2000 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 approximately 239 million or 553 of the revenue increase was attributable to increases in fees based on assets of investment products linked to msci indices and the balance to additional index subscriptions from existing and new clients growth of assets in etfs linked to our equity indices drove the higher fees we received from assets in investment products the majority of growth in assets under management was the result of increased investment flows into the etfs 

revenues from equity portfolio analytics increased 106 million or 97 to 1206 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase was the result of strong new subscription growth for our equity risk models and related analytics products with a notable increase in demand for our proprietary equity risk data through thirdparty software vendors in addition this increase was due to significantly higher retention rates for barra aegis 

  

revenues from multiasset class portfolio analytics increased 62 million or 367 to 231 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase primarily reflects additional subscriptions to barraone by asset owners and fund managers with notable strength from emea and the americas the increase in barraone revenue was offset in part by a decline in revenues from totalrisk due to our decision in late 2006 to stop licensing subscriptions to totalrisk 

revenues from other products decreased 09 million or 32 to 262 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the decrease is principally the result of the cancellation of a large fixed income index subscription at the end of first quarter 2007 and decreased revenues from msci hedge fund indices due to declining asset levels of investment products linked to these indices the decrease was mitigated by strong growth in our energy and commodity valuation analytics product subscriptions marketed under the fea brand 

expenses 

 

 total operating expenses of 2405 million for the fiscal year ended november 30 2007 were 131 million or 58 higher compared to fiscal 2006 excluding the founders grant expense of 08 million operating expenses increased 54 to 2397 million for fiscal 2007 with compensation expense increasing 101 and noncompensation expense remaining unchanged for fiscal 2007 compensation and benefit expenses represented 558 of the total operating expenses compared to 532 in fiscal 2006 excluding expenses related to the founders grant of 08 million and the 97 million of nonrecurring items in 2006 91 million of selling general and administrative expenses which are discussed below expenses for fiscal 2007 increased 104 comprised of compensation and benefits costs increases of 149 and noncompensation expenses increases of 53 compared to fiscal year 2006 

cost of services 

cost of services increased 63 million or 54 to 1217 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the majority of the increase 38 million was driven by increased personnel costs that reflected hires made in the second half of 2006 in the information technology group as well as the hiring of a chief operating officer additional market data costs including costs associated with introducing the gimi methodology rent increases from adding business continuity space in hong kong and london as well as higher allocations of information technology and administrative expenses from morgan stanley were the largest contributors to noncompensation expense growth as a percentage of revenues cost of services declined to 329 from 372 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 67 million or 78 to 925 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase was mainly due to an increase in compensation and benefit expenses which increased 93 million or 191 due to the hiring of additional employees in the second half of 2006 and increased compensation and benefit costs for existing personnel overall noncompensation expenses decreased year over year by 26 million or 70 

fiscal 2006 included a number of expense items not repeated in fiscal 2007 which totaled 91 million these nonrecurring expenses included accrued stock based compensation expense for equity awards for 

  

retirement eligible employees recruitment fees associated with senior staff additions and acquisition related costs excluding these 91 million of nonrecurring items in 2006 expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by 205 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase included a 307 increase in compensation and benefit expenses and a 68 increase in noncompensation expenses the increase in compensation and benefit expenses was driven by the full year cost in fiscal 2007 related to staff hires made in the second half of 2006 and increased compensation and benefit costs for existing personnel increases in noncompensation costs for fiscal 2007 were due to an increase in the allocation of general and administrative expenses from morgan stanley and travel expenses incurred as a result of the growth of our sales organization 

as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses declined to 250 from 276 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense increased 02 million or 08 to 264 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a percentage of revenues amortization expense declined to 71 from 84 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net decreased 756 to 39 million for fiscal year 2007 the net decrease was the result of an increase in gross interest expense and a reduction of gross interest income gross interest income decreased as a result of holding substantially lower cash balances resulting from the payment of the 973 million dividend to morgan stanley and capital group international we experienced higher gross interest expense on account of interest due on the demand note issued to morgan stanley in july 2007 and following repayment of the demand note on borrowings of 4250 million under the credit facility we entered into simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering see “—liquidity and capital resources” below 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes increased 161 million or 446 to 522 million for fiscal 2007 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 increased to 391 from 363 in fiscal 2006 the increase reflects higher taxable earnings and two significant adjustments to the tax provision 

as a result of a recent settlement entered into by morgan stanley with new york state and new york city tax authorities we will now be included in the combined new york state and new york city income tax returns of morgan stanley and have increased taxes for the period 1999 through 2007 when filing as a separate taxpayer our new york state and new york city income taxes were lower than when calculated as part of morgan stanley’s combined state and local income tax return over the applicable period consequently we recorded an adjustment of 37 million for tax and interest net of federal tax benefit relating to tax years 1999 through 2007 to reflect the additional taxes owed 

the other component of the increased income tax provision is the establishment of additional tax reserves of 17 million related to the potential disallowance of certain research and experimental tax credits previously allocated to us 

so long as msci is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of morgan stanley and in returns filed by morgan stanley with certain state and foreign taxing jurisdictions our tax liability will reflect amounts due as outlined under our tax sharing agreement dated november 20 2007 with morgan stanley 

  

fiscal year ended november 30 2006 compared to fiscal year ended november 30 2005 

revenues 

 

  

 revenues increased 322 million or 116 to 3107 million for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 growth in index subscriptions was the main driver while increased assetbased fees attributable to higher assets of investment products linked to msci equity indices also contributed strongly to revenue growth the increase also reflects increased revenues from equity portfolio analytics partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our multiasset class portfolio analytics products and other products including hedge fund indices price increases contributed very little to our revenue growth 

revenues from equity indices increased 302 million or 239 to 1568 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 approximately 21 million or 70 of the revenue increase was attributable to index subscriptions and the remainder to fees based on assets of investment products linked to msci indices growth of assets in etfs linked to our equity indices drove the higher fees we received from assets of investment products a majority of the growth in assets under management was the result of increased investment flows into the etfs 

revenues from equity portfolio analytics increased 34 million or 32 to 1100 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the increase reflects additional subscriptions to equity models direct by existing and new clients as well as higher retention rates for barra aegis 

revenues from multiasset class portfolio analytics decreased 04 million or 22 to 169 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the decrease stems from a decline in totalrisk revenues of 18 million attributable to lower retention rates as well as our decision to stop licensing subscriptions to totalrisk and gradually transition clients from totalrisk to barraone the decline in totalrisk revenues was offset in part by a 14 million increase from barraone revenues attributable to new subscriptions from asset owners and balanced fund managers 

revenues from other products decreased 10 million or 37 due to lower fees attributable to reduced assets of investment products linked to our hedge fund indices the decrease was mitigated by strong growth in our energy and commodity valuation analytics product subscriptions marketed under the fea brand 

  

expenses 

 

 total expenses of 2274 million for the fiscal year ended november 30 2006 were 226 million or 11 higher compared to fiscal 2005 compensation and benefits continue to account for our largest expense increase accounting for 129 million in growth from the prior year this increase stems from hiring personnel to support business growth mainly in the us and europe and the hiring of a chief operating officer and a chief financial officer additional increases were principally due to rises in general and administrative expenses from morgan stanley information technology and software engineering costs the percentage of compensation and benefits expenses of total operating expenses remained unchanged at 53 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

cost of services 

cost of services increased 88 million or 83 to 1154 million in fiscal 2006 versus 2005 the rise mainly stems from higher research information technology and software engineering costs incurred in order to add new product features and to expand the breadth of our equity securities universe the increase is also attributable to the hiring of a chief operating officer in addition allocations from morgan stanley increased by 24 million to reflect our expanded use of services after we migrated barra onto morgan stanley platforms as a percentage of revenues cost of services declined to 37 in fiscal 2006 from 38 in 2005 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 156 million or 222 to 858 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the primary drivers of the increase in fiscal 2006 were an increase in personnel and occupancy costs the increase in personnel costs was a result of expanding staffing in the sales organization and information technology infrastructure areas as well as the hiring of a chief financial officer the hiring also caused recruiting expenses to increase substantially compared to 2005 higher occupancy costs were attributable to the expansion of office space and the establishment of business continuity sites in hong kong and london as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses increased to 28 from 25 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense decreased 19 million or 67 to 262 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the decrease principally reflects the full amortization of some components of our identified intangibles primarily related to developed technology for our energy and commodity products by the end of fiscal 2005 as a percentage of revenues amortization expense decreased to 8 from 10 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net increased 89 million or 122 to 162 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the increase reflects higher average cash balances including cash deposited with morgan stanley and higher average interest rates earned on these balances as well as a 11 million gain associated with the sale of our interest in two unconsolidated companies loanperformance and valubond in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as a percentage of revenues interest and other income net increased to 5 from 3 

  

provision for income taxes

discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations net of tax increased 43 million or 1128 to 81 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 pretax income from discontinued operations increased 69 million or 1172 to 127 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 on february 1 2005 we sold our interest in posit jv to our joint venture partner itg for 900 million we recorded a pretax gain of 68 million at the time of sale as part of the sale agreement we were entitled to additional royalties for a period of 10 years subsequent to the sale through an earnout arrangement based on fees earned by itg related to the posit system in september 2006 itg exercised its option to accelerate the earnout period by making a lump sum payment to us of 117 million in addition we received royalty payments of 32 million and 10 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006 respectively prior to the lump sum earnout payment 

liquidity and capital resources 

we require capital to fund ongoing operations internal growth initiatives and acquisitions our working capital requirements and funding for capital expenditures strategic investments and acquisitions have historically been part of the corporatewide cash management program of morgan stanley we are solely responsible for the provision of funds to finance our working capital and other cash requirements 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under the credit facility we intend to use these sources of liquidity to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures investments and acquisitions in connection with our business strategy we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth 

as described above in “—factors impacting comparability of our financial results—july 2007 dividend” we paid a dividend of 9730 million consisting of 3250 million in cash and 6480 million of demand notes on july 19 2007 morgan stanley was issued a demand note in the amount of 6259 million and capital group international was issued a demand note in the amount of 221 million on july 19 2007 we paid in full in cash the 221 million demand note held by capital group international 

on november 14 2007 we entered into the 5000 million credit facility with morgan stanley senior funding inc and bank of america na as agents for a syndicate of lenders and other lenders party thereto the credit facility is comprised of a 2000 million term loan a facility a 2250 million term loan b facility which was issued at a discount of 05 of the principal amount resulting in proceeds of approximately 2239 million and a 750 million revolving credit facility under which there were no drawings as of november 30 2007 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at i libor plus a fixed margin of 250 in the case of the term loan a facility and the revolving facility and 300 in the case of the term loan b facility or ii the base rate plus a fixed margin of 150 in the case of the term loan a facility and the revolving facility and 200 in the case of the term loan b facility in each case subject to interest rate step downs based on the achievement of consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility conditions the term loan a facility and the term loan b facility will mature on november 20 2012 and november 20 2014 respectively on november 20 2007 we borrowed 4250 million the full amount of the term loans under the credit facility and used the proceeds to pay a portion of the 6259 million demand note held by morgan stanley the balance 

  

of the demand note was paid with the net proceeds from our initial public offering the revolving credit facility is available for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes including the financing of permitted acquisitions subject to certain conditions and matures on november 20 2012 

the credit facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a valid and perfected first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the shares of capital stock of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and up to 65 of the shares of capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries’ present and future property and assets and the proceeds thereof in addition the credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and our existing or future subsidiaries’ abilities among other things to

cash flows 

 

   

cash and cash equivalents and cash deposited with related parties 

cash and cash equivalents were 338 million 244 million and 234 million as of november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively this constituted approximately 37 of total assets as of november 30 2007 and 22 as of each of november 30 2006 and 2005 respectively excess cash is deposited with morgan stanley and is shown separately on the balance sheet under cash deposited with related parties cash deposited with related parties was 1376 million 3302 million and 2529 million as of november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively representing approximately 152 297 and 241 of total assets respectively our cash including cash equivalents and cash deposited with related parties decreased in fiscal 2007 this decrease was primarily the result of cash used in financing activities representing the payment of a cash dividend of 9730 million we believe that our cash flow from operations including prepaid subscription fees together with existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for capital expenditures and other cash needs for ongoing business operations for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

cash flows from operating activities 

in fiscal 2007 our operating cash flow reflected net income of 811 million adjusted for noncash items such as amortization of intangible assets of 264 million and depreciation of 15 million during fiscal 2007 we generated operating cash flows of 352 million from the settlement of related party balances our collections were offset by our payment of 475 million in settlement of related party balances owed and by an increase in accounts receivable 

our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for payment of cash compensation expenses office rent technology costs and services provided by morgan stanley in addition we expect to meet all interest obligations on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility from cash generated by operations the payment of cash compensation expenses is historically at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year 

timing differences relating to the payment of amounts due to related parties between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 caused us to use 475 million of cash during fiscal 2007 in settlement of related party balances 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities include cash used for capital expenditures cash deposited with morgan stanley and cash received from the sale of discontinued operations in fiscal 2007 the amount of cash deposited with morgan stanley decreased by 1926 million as a result of the payment of the 9730 million cash dividend offset by the proceeds of our initial public offering and the borrowings against the credit facility capital expenditures totaled 05 million in fiscal 2007 relating primarily to the purchase of computer equipment and buildout costs of leased office space we anticipate funding any future capital expenditures out of our operating cash flows 

in fiscal 2005 we sold our interest in posit jv to our joint venture partner itg for 900 million we deposited the cash proceeds from this sale with morgan stanley contributing in part to the increase of 1540 million in cash deposited with related parties during fiscal 2005 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities largely represent payments for cash dividends cash dividends paid in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 amounted to 9730 million 50 million and 00 million respectively during fiscal 2007 the net cash used in financing activities was 2921 million representing the payment of a dividend of 9730 million less the proceeds from our initial public offering and the borrowings against the credit facility 

  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space capital leases for equipment and other operating leases obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts and obligations arising from borrowings under the credit facility the following summarizes our contractual obligations 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

at november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for us as of december 1 2007 the effect of adopting fin 48 does not have a material impact on results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective beginning an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 or upon early adoption of fasb statement no 159 we early adopted fasb statement no 159 as of december 1 2006 and in effect adopted sfas no 157 at the same time accordingly we adopted sfas no 157 on december 1 2006 the adoption of sfas no 157 did not have a material impact on our combined financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” our employees currently participate in morgan stanley’s pension and postretirement plans among other items sfas no 158 required recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of morgan stanley’s defined benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending november 30 2007 morgan stanley recorded an aftertax charge of 208 million to shareholders’ equity upon the adoption of this requirement we recorded an after tax charge of 09 million to shareholders’ equity upon adoption of this requirement sfas no 158 also requires the measurement of defined benefit and postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year sfas no 158’s requirement to use the fiscal yearend date as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 morgan stanley expects to early adopt a fiscal yearend measurement date for its fiscal year ending november 30 2008 morgan stanley currently expects to record an aftertax charge of approximately 15 million to shareholders’ equity upon the early adoption of the measurement date change the company also expects to early adopt the measurement date change but expects the impact of this change to be immaterial 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “statement no 159” statement no 159 permits entities to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in the fair values of those items unrealized gains and losses recognized in the statement of income for each reporting period under this statement fair value elections can be made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis are irrevocable and can only be made upon specified election date events in addition new disclosure requirements apply with respect to instruments for which fair value measurement is elected we elected to early adopt statement no 159 as of december 1 2006 we chose not to make any fair value elections with respect to any of its eligible assets or liabilities as permitted under the provisions of statement no 159 

in june 2007 the eitf reached consensus on issue no 0611 “accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on sharebased payment awards” eitf issue no 0611 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units that are expected to vest be recorded as an increase to additional paidin capital we currently account for this tax benefit as a reduction to our income tax provision eitf issue no 0611 is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 we currently are evaluating the potential impact of adopting eitf issue no 0611 

 

 foreign currency risk 

we have exposures to currency exchange fluctuation risk—revenues from indexlinked investment products such as exchange traded funds nonus dollar invoiced revenues and nonus dollar operating expenses 

revenues from equity indexlinked investment products represented approximately 629 million or 170 of our operating revenues for fiscal year 2007 while our fees for indexlinked investment products are generally invoiced in us dollars the fees are based on the investment product’s assets substantially all of which are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly declines in such other currencies against the us dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses in addition declines in such currencies against the us dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses 

we generally invoice our clients in us dollars however we invoice a portion of clients in euros pounds sterling japanese yen and a limited number of other nonus dollar currencies approximately 567 million or 153 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended november 30 2007 are denominated in foreign currencies of which the majority are in euros pounds sterling and japanese yen 

we are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs although our expenses are generally in us dollars some of our expenses are incurred in nonus dollar denominated currencies approximately 556 million or 231 of our expenses for the fiscal year ended november 30 2007 were denominated in foreign currencies the significant majority of which were denominated in swiss francs pounds sterling hong kong dollars euros and japanese yen expenses paid in foreign currency may increase as we expand our business outside the us and replace services provided by morgan stanley internationally for which we currently pay morgan stanley in us dollars 

to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase generally we do not use derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk however we may do so in the future foreign currency cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 338 million 244 million and 234 million at november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively these amounts were held primarily in checking money market accounts in the countries where we maintain banking relationships the majority of excess cash is deposited with our parent company at november 30 2007 2006 and 2005 amounts held with our parent company were 1376 million 3302 million and 2529 million respectively on our statements of financial condition these amounts are shown as “cash deposited with related parties” we receive interest at morgan stanley’s internal prevailing rates on these funds the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates declines in interest rates however will reduce future interest income 

as a result of the dividend discussed above in “—factors impacting comparability—july 2007 dividend” and financings as discussed in “factors impacting comparability—credit facility” we expect interest income to be substantially lower and interest expense to be substantially higher in future periods any borrowings under the credit facility will accrue interest at a variable rate equal to i libor plus a fixed margin of 250 in the case of the term loan a facility and the revolving facility and 300 in the case of the term loan b facility or ii the base rate plus a fixed margin of 150 in the case of the term loan a facility and the revolving facility and 200 in the case of the term loan b facility in each case subject to interest rate step downs based on the achievement of consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility conditions we expect to pay down the credit facility with cash generated from our ongoing operations in addition we were required by the terms of our credit facility to enter into an interest rate swap within 90 days of november 20 2007 in order to convert a portion of our variable rate funding to fixed rate funding 

on february 13 2008 we entered into interest rate swap agreements effective through the end of november 2010 for an aggregate notional principal amount of 2517 million by entering into these agreements we reduced interest rate risk by effectively converting floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt this action reduces our risk of incurring higher interest costs in periods of rising interest rates and improves the overall balance between floating and fixed rate debt the effective fixed rate on the notional principal amount swapped is approximately 565 these swaps are designated as fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
