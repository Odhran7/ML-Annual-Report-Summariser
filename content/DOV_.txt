we support achievement of these goals by 1 aligning management compensation with strategic and financial objectives 2 actively managing our portfolio to increase enterprise scale improve business mix over time to markets with secular growth characteristics and pursue acquisitions that fit the characteristics of an ideal dover business and 3 investing in talent development programs 

characteristics of a dover business 

our businesses generally operate in strategically attractive niche industrial markets with supportive longterm growth trends favorable supply and demand landscapes mature and incrementally improving technologies and highly loyal customers suppliers or channel partners our businesses have consistently enjoyed a customer base that chooses products primarily 

based on their performance track record safety and compliance in many instances our businesses produce critical equipment or components to a larger system where valueinuse and costs and risks of switching far exceed the cost of the product itself our products tend to have meaningful replacement consumable or aftermarket demand due in part to a large installed base because they play a specialized role in customer applications recurring demand which includes parts consumables services and software represents approximately 35 of our revenue additionally many of our products enjoy recurring likeforlike replacement demand patterns our businesses increasingly complement our component or equipment offerings with digital solutions such as connected products sensors and software that create new sources of value to our customers and allow dover businesses to drive growth and increase relevance with our customers dover businesses also exhibit attractive financial profiles characterized by predictable stable revenue low capital intensity strong cashflow and sustainable returns on invested capital well in excess of our cost of capital 

business strategy 

to achieve our stated goals we are focused on executing the following pillars of dover’s business strategy 

capturing growth potential in our endmarkets and adjacent market segments 

dover’s business segments are focused on building enduring competitive advantages and leadership positions in markets we believe are positioned for sustained future growth we believe our businesses are among the top suppliers in most markets and niches we serve as defined by customer applications geographies or products which positions us well to capture future growth we capitalize on our engineering technology and design expertise and maintain an intense focus on meeting the needs of our customers and on adding significant and often new value to their operations through superior product performance safety reliability and a commitment to aftermarket support we cultivate and maintain an entrepreneurial culture to enable business agility and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve 

in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on growing industrial manufacturing and trade volumes adoption of digital technologies increasing requirements for sustainability safety energy efficiency and consumer product safety and growth of the middle class and consumption in emerging economies our engineered products segment is capitalizing on secular growth in waste generation and the increasing sophistication and automation of waste collection operations increasing car parc car age and miles driven as well as increasing digitization and sensorization of modern vehicles our clean energy  fueling segment benefits from the worldwide growth in environmental safety and compliance regulations new infrastructure buildout in emerging economies consolidation in the convenience retail sector increased digitization of convenience stores and fuel retailing clean energy products as well as secular growth in automated vehicle wash systems and solutions over manual and doityourself washing our imaging  identification segment leverages its unique product offering containing equipment consumables software and services to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing increased demand for product traceability and brand protection and consumer product safety our pumps  process solutions segment is focused on capturing growth in its installed base the growing sophistication of fluid transfer and rotating machinery components within the biopharma and hygienic markets chemical plastics and polymer industrial mid and downstream oil  gas and globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support our climate  sustainability technologies segment is responding to our customers’ demand for increased energy efficiency and sustainability in food retail merchandising solutions as well as increasing demand for sustainable heating and cooling solutions and growing global demand for aluminum beverage containers 

we aim to capture growth by making organic investments in research and development developing new products and technologies improving digital capabilities expanding our geographic coverage and pursuing disciplined strategic acquisitions that will enhance our portfolio and position dover for longterm growth we continually evaluate how our assets and capabilities can position us to grow in markets adjacent to our core businesses for example new applications geographies product segments or adjacent technologies where we can be advantaged 

in addition to product innovation we aim to capture growth by developing digital technologies our bostonbased dover digital labs serves as the companywide hub for our digital initiative we have continued to invest in this facility and our team of software developers data scientists and product managers to enhance our digital capabilities the digital labs team is driving digital transformation across our businesses in three areas i enhancing the customer experience through more 

efficient and streamlined digital customer interfaces that make it easy to do bus iness with dover companies ii developing connected software and machine learning augmented solutions built to int egrate into and work with our core equipment and component offerings and iii driving increased efficiency safety and quality in our manufacturing operations by employing cuttingedge automation and “digital factory” solutions we believe the digital labs centers contributions in these areas enable us to add significant value to our products and to capture commercial growth opportunities by leveraging a central resource for industrial internet of things iiot and connected product initiatives we are able to capture efficiencies in our digital transformation efforts improve product security and offer better efficiency in software and sensor integration engineering to keep our projects costcompetitive 

improving profitability and return on invested capital 

we are committed to generating sustainable returns on invested capital well above the cost of capital across all of our businesses we continually evaluate and pursue opportunities to improve efficiency margin and return on capital we are intensely foc used on driving operational excellence across our businesses we have implemented numerous productivity initiatives to maximize our efficiency such as supply chain integration shared services lean manufacturing principles and production automation as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees our businesses place a strong emphasis on continual product quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and to facilitate expansion into new products and geographic markets 

we also focus on margin expansion initiatives designed to reduce our selling general and administrative cost base and rationalize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint across the portfolio we continually expand initiatives to extract productivity gains across the businesses and realize savings our margin expansion initiatives are focused on four core enterprise capabilities 1 leverage our digital labs team to enhance our internal and marketfacing digital capabilities 2 improve utilization and optimization of our manufacturing footprint through centralized resources and investment 3 further centralize shared services under dover business services and 4 invest in our india innovation center shared services 

dover digital our dover digital labs consists of a team of approximately 100 software developers data scientists and product managers who provide digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience develop connected products and drive automation and efficiency inside our factories through digital technologies and in our business processes our dover digital labs team has built common platforms which we have begun deploying on customer facing applications to make it easier to find configure buy and obtain products and services from dover companies it has also deployed shared iiot capability such that many of dovers products are remotely configurable and monitored enabling our businesses to sell aftermarket parts and offer remote diagnostic services 

dover operational excellence  in 2019 we began to coordinate and oversee operations management from the corporate center of excellence through a team composed of functional experts in operational optimization lean manufacturing automation hse health safety and environment and complex project management this team works closely with our businesses to drive execution excellence in our operational processes standards and measurement tools to identify prioritize and monitor execution of operational improvement initiatives with expertise in health and safety supply chain management lean operations project management and advanced manufacturing and automation we continue to focus on initiatives to improve operational efficiency and enhance and solidify the continuous improvement programs embedded in our businesses daytoday operations 

dover business services  we continue to invest in dover business services shared service centers consisting of a team of approximately 450 people to provide important transactional and valueadded services to our businesses our shared service model allows us to leverage scale across dover increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls our shared service centers create value by freeing resources within our businesses that would otherwise be dedicated to transactional services and allowing them to focus on customers markets and product excellence we expect to continue driving efficiencies through dover business services as we increase the level of service centralization across the portfolio 

india innovation center our india innovation center has a team of approximately 600 engineers and it professionals that our businesses rely on to leverage for product engineering digital solutions development data  information management research  development and intellectual property services the scale of this team allows our businesses to access resources 

with capabilities and expertise across many disciplines that would be unaffordable to them as standalone companies and allows for concurrent engineering on time sensitive projects 

we have been steadily investing in the build out and deployment of the above four enterprise capabilities in the past several years including investing over 20 million in capital expenditures during 20192021 and significantly expanding the staff of experts and support personnel in key centers of excellence globally 

disciplined capital allocation and continuous portfolio enhancement 

we are focused on the most efficient allocation of capital to maximize returns on investment to do this we utilize organic reinvestment to grow and strengthen our existing businesses we plan to make average annual investments in capital spending of 2  3 of revenue with a focus on internal projects designed to expand our market participation develop new products and improve productivity in addition we seek to deploy capital in acquisitions in attractive growth areas across our five segments dover focuses primarily on bolton acquisitions applying strict selection criteria of market attractiveness including growth market landscape and performancebased competition business fit including sustained leading position revenue visibility and favorable customer valueadd versus switching cost or risk and financial return profile accretive growth and margins and doubledigit return on invested capital we opportunistically divest businesses where we see limited runway for future value creation relative to our aspirations or where market and business fundamentals change and no longer fit our criteria of business attractiveness and portfolio fit finally we have consistently returned cash to shareholders by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 66 years we undertake opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy we employ a prudent financial policy to support our capital allocation strategy which includes maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

portfolio development 

acquisitions 

our acquisition program has two key elements as a first priority we seek to acquire attractive addon businesses with a strong fit that enhance our existing franchises either by increasing their reach and customer access by broadening their product mix or by enhancing technological capability and customer valueadd second in the right circumstances we may strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that complement our existing businesses or provide a path for us to pursue growth in near adjacencies with all our acquisitions we seek businesses that are leaders in their markets or niches have a strong track record for innovation offer differentiated solutions clearly complement our businesses have a solid organic growth profile and attractive and sustainable returns and offer significant synergy potential to generate doubledigit return on capital within three years after the acquisition is completed 

over the past three years 2019 through 2021 we have spent approximately 16773 million net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration to purchase eighteen businesses for more details see note 3 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses that expand the scope of our offerings and make us an even more important supplier to our customers while we expect to generate annual organic revenue growth greater than gdp or 3 to 5 annually on average over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary adverse economic conditions our success in consistently growing the portfolio is also dependent on the ability to acquire and integrate businesses successfully within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal scorecard and welldefined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created 

dispositions 

from time to time we have sold or divested some of our businesses based on changes in specific market outlook structural changes in financial performance valuecreation potential or for other strategic considerations which included an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets or focus on our higher margin growth spaces 

going forward we recognize that some businesses in dover’s portfolio may have a greater valuecreation potential if owned by another parent with a larger presence and focus on a given niche we pragmatically consider such opportunities as part of 

our ongoing portfolio management and review processes and execute divestitures if the value created is determined to be at an appropriate premium to the value of such business to dover and the divestitures allow dover shareholders to participate in the future valuecreation potential from a change in ownership 

for more details see note 4 — dispositions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

business segments

our climate  sustainability technologies segments products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits at the consolidated level while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing can be volatile particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

markets for multiple raw materials saw significant cost increases throughout 2021 as well as increases in transportation costs to deliver materials to our manufacturing sites which we partially offset through price increases and other levers additionally supply chain disruptions have caused shortages of material inputs in several of our businesses which negatively impacted profitability of such businesses as we were required to seek alternative sources of supply at higher costs or interrupt our normal manufacturing process flow leading to less efficient output and cost 

research and development 

our businesses invest to develop innovative new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs including demand for energyefficient products designed to help customers meet sustainability goals expand revenue opportunities geographically maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs 

our imaging  identification segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification printing equipment and software solutions believe their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduction in total cost of ownership the result has been downward pricing trends that can only be mitigated with the continuous introduction of innovative product solutions in a market where product life cycles generally average less than seven years 

our clean energy  fueling segment invests in research and development to advance innovative traditional and alternative fuel dispensing equipment and components payment platforms fuel site asset management and connectivity solutions iiotenabled cloudbased connected solutions for retail and commercial fleet fueling settings components for highcriticality cryogenic gas storage and transportation applications including hydrogen and liquified natural gas these technology investments align with our customer’s needs and our commitment to delivering to our customers opportunities for operational cost reductions increased sales and an enhanced customer experience for their customers through a combination of intelligent fueling and retail solutions 

our pumps  process solutions segment invests in research and development for new product introduction and custom solutions to drive volume and share in both existing markets and newerfaster growth markets – such as singleuse biopharmaceutical manufacturing and liquid cooling of high performance electronics these investments will allow us to take advantage of existing growth trends such as vaccine production for certain covid19 vaccines and also cell and gene therapy applications coming on the market 

many of our businesses are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes some of these businesses experience a much more rapid rate of change requiring higher product development capability and new product introduction 

similarly our businesses invest in research and development to pursue digital strategies based on customer needs and leverage the capabilities of the dover digital labs center to deliver on those digital strategies for example vehicle services group within the engineered products segment launched mosaic advanced diagnostic technology built in partnership with burke porter group and work completed at the digital labs mosaic is the automotive repair industry’s first digitally enabled cloud based aftermarket advanced driver assistance systems adas sensor calibration technology environmental solutions group from the engineered products segment launched artificial intelligence capabilities through 3rd eye digital solution to use data to improve operations outcomes for waste hauling fleets 

human capital resources 

our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans our success in delivering high quality and innovative products and solutions for our customers and driving operational excellence is only achievable through the talent expertise and dedication of our global team we had approximately 25000 employees worldwide as of december 31 2021 

attraction development and retention 

we recognize that attracting developing and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve while our operating companies are the hubs of these activities — an effective model that puts ownership in the businesses and cultures that are the source of opportunities for employees — we are increasingly leveraging the corporate center to drive talent recruitment and development and consistent human capital management practices across our businesses this centerled focus is enabling us to make development opportunities available across our enterprise which promotes employee advancement engagement and retention we offer employees resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the diverse entrepreneurial talent inside our global businesses to fill key positions we seek people who are proactive and dedicated demonstrate an ownership mindset and share our commitment to the pursuit of operational excellence we continue to make significant investments in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success 

diversity and inclusion 

we view the diversity of our employees as a strength to better serve our customers and communities we also believe the diversity of our workforce enables us to attract new talent keeps our employees engaged and productive and advances innovation from ideas reflecting the broad diversity of our employees backgrounds experiences and perspectives to that end we have taken various actions to enhance diversity including partnering with organizations that can support our efforts to identify and recruit talented and diverse candidates 

we aim to cultivate an inclusive culture that enables employees to feel connected to our business objectives and valued for their contributions one of the ways in which we seek to promote an inclusive work environment is by supporting our operating companies in establishing employee resource groups these groups allow for collaboration and serve as an open forum for networking professional development and mentoring we are committed to our efforts to maintain a work environment that is professional inclusive and free from discrimination and harassment to help educate our workforce on the benefits of an inclusive environment and drive awareness we have invested in training across the organization focused on diversity and inclusion topics 

health and safety 

we are committed to providing a healthy environment and safe workplace by operating in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities and maintaining an enhanced health and safety compliance program we regularly conduct selfassessments to examine our safety culture and processes in response to covid19 we have taken and continue to take measures to protect our workforce we have modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to adhere to guidance from the us centers for disease control and prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network in addition we have invested at the corporate center to provide oversight enhance coordination and ensure robust safety protocols are present across our operations 

human capital investments related to strategic priorities 

in line with our strategic priorities we have additionally invested in the following aspects of human capital resource management among other areas 

• dover digital labs – we are continuing to leverage our digital labs team to improve our digital capabilities our team of software developers data scientists and product managers drive digital transformation across our businesses by enhancing customer experience developing connected products and enabling digital manufacturing 

• operational management – our operations teams including our management team at the corporate center continually focuses on improving operational efficiency such as implementing production automation 

• shared services – we are continuing to further centralize shared services under dover business services and our india innovation center our shared services capabilities include a wide range of functional areas including transactional support human resources it engineering and product development these services enable productivity and growth as well as free up resources at our businesses to focus on customers markets and product development 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been created registered or acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers none of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2021 given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are not significant businesses supplying the environmental solutions defense automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

seasonality 

in general while our businesses are not highly seasonal we do tend to have stronger revenue generation in the second half of the year which is driven by customer capital expenditure timing and seasonal activity patterns in our endmarkets our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase in the second half of the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends which moderates the aforementioned seasonality patterns our food retail refrigeration business tends to face higher levels of demand in the second and third quarters as retailers avoid construction and remodeling activity during fallwinter holidays 

competition 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation a summary of our key competitors within each of our segments follows 



international 

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we aim to grow our revenue in international markets particularly in developing economies in asia the middle east eastern europe and south america 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in china france germany italy sweden switzerland the united kingdom and other locations including australia brazil canada india mexico and the netherlands 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets see note 19 — segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

sustainability 

we are committed to creating economic value for shareholders by developing products designed to help our customers meet their sustainability goals run their operations more efficiently and satisfy evolving regulatory and environmental standards we believe that sustainabilitydriven innovation in response to customer demand helps us contribute positively to enhanced resource efficiency and waste reduction while presenting a valuable growth opportunity aligned with this commitment in 2021 we announced sciencebased targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions these targets include an absolute reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 marketbased greenhouse gas emissions of 30 percent by 2030 from a 2019 baseline year and an absolute reduction of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions of 15 percent by 2030 from a 2019 baseline year 

we highlight key initiatives and performance metrics about our sustainability activities under the “sustainability” tab on our website wwwdovercorporationcom 

other matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in passthrough costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

other information 

we make available free of charge through the investor information link on our website wwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the contents of our website are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this form 10k and any reference to our website is intended to be inactive textual references only 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our businesses including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

business and operational risks 

• the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to our businesses the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our businesses including demand for our products across multiple endmarkets as well as our supply chain and operations while we have experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies the public health situation global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook accordingly we are currently unable to quantify the full and longterm impact of the pandemic on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate the risks of covid19 by working with our customers employees suppliers and other stakeholders significant portions of our workforce and operations have been impacted by quarantines government orders and guidance facility closures illness travel restrictions implementation of precautionary measures and other restrictions over the course of the pandemic we have continued to operate in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities while maintaining an enhanced health and safety compliance program more specifically we have modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to adhere to guidance from the us centers for disease control and prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network with respect to social distancing physical separation personal protective equipment and sanitization and have restricted the number of employees permitted in common areas at any given time the emergence of new variants of covid19 evolving government plans around the world to institute vaccination mandates including in the us and limited availability of vaccines in various jurisdictions create uncertainty that may impact our employees and result in labor shortages and unforeseen costs in addition because the pandemic has decreased customer demand in many of our endmarkets some of our businesses have continued to operate at reduced capacity we cannot predict the number or timing of any future facility closures the potential for operating at reduced capacity or the size of the workforce that may be impacted by potential labor actions such as furloughs or layoffs 

the extent to which our operations may be impacted by covid19 will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain including the pandemics duration the emergence of different covid19 variants the efficacy and adoption rates of vaccines the availability of recently approved oral medicines and actions by governments and private enterprises to contain the outbreak or mitigate the impact of the pandemic for example applicable laws and government measures such as us federal vaccine mandates or occupational safety and health administration requirements for vaccination or regular testing could also result in skilled labor impacts including voluntary attrition or difficulty finding labor or otherwise adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities obtain materials and component inputs from suppliers or deliver our products in a timely manner furthermore the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it will have on our financial position operating results and cash flows in future periods 

• increases in labor costs potential labor disputes and work stoppages or an inability to hire skilled personnel could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of collective bargaining units in the us and various collective labor arrangements outside the us we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

furthermore the competition for skilled personnel is often intense in the regions in which our manufacturing facilities are located a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base increases in the salaries and wages paid by competing employers as a result of general macroeconomic factors or otherwise could lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and potentially further increase salaries and wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level our business financial condition and results of of operations could be adversely affected 

• our reputation ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions where we do business including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims competition export and import compliance environmental compliance money laundering and data privacy as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits lead to increased costs of compliance and damage our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• we are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets 

approximately 46 and 45 of our revenues for 2021 and 2020 respectively were derived outside the united states and we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues given our global growth strategy as a result of our international operations and our global expansion strategy we are subject to various risks including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• our operations businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks 

we depend on our own and third party it systems including cloudbased systems and managed service providers to store process and protect our information and support our business activities we also use third party it systems to support employee data processing for our global workforce and to support customer business activities such as transmitting payment information providing mobile monitoring services and capturing operational data additionally some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks increasingly our customers including government customers are requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards for our products our business has both an increasing reliance on it systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies connected devices and digital offerings as well as expanded remote work policies if these technologies systems products or services are damaged cease to function properly are compromised due to employee or thirdparty contractor error user error malfeasance system errors or other vulnerabilities or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving denial of service attacks unauthorized access malicious software or other intrusions including by criminals nation states or insiders our business may be adversely impacted the impacts could include production downtimes operational delays and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers compromise of confidential proprietary or otherwise protected information including personal information and customer confidential data destruction corruption or theft of data or intellectual property manipulation disruption or improper use of these technologies systems products or services financial losses from fraudulent transactions remedial actions loss of business or potential liability adverse media coverage and legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations actions and fines and damage to our reputation there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers by both statesponsored and criminal organizations moreover there has been a rise in the number of 

cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds 

these trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks it is possible for vulnerabilities in our it systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training systems monitoring and other technical security controls a breach response plan maintenance of backup and protective systems and security personnel notwithstanding those measures our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows we and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations are regularly the target of and periodically respond to cyberattacks including phishing and denialofservice attacks and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption in addition a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it and actions decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business results of operations and reputation while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise as cyber threats continue to evolve cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the us and globally and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more internetenabled products and offerings we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs strengthen our information security data protection and business continuity measures and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities 

• unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances or claims related to patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects to cause property damage to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures which would reduce operating profit and cash flow in addition a product recall may require significant management attention product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our revenue operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights our businesses employ various measures to develop maintain and protect their intellectual property rights these measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of our businesses intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• we could be negatively impacted by environmental social and governance esg and sustainability matters 

governments shareholders customers employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate esg practices and disclosures and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving and growing we have announced certain initiatives including goals regarding our focus areas which include greenhouse gas emissions reductions health and safety diversity and inclusion talent attraction and development and innovation for sustainable products the criteria by which our esg practices are assessed may change due to the evolution of the sustainability landscape which could result in greater expectations of us and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new criteria moreover the increasing attention to sustainability could also result in reduced demand for certain of our products or services andor reduced profits if we are unable to respond effectively investors may conclude that our policies andor actions with respect to esg matters are inadequate if we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals our reputation business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

industry risks 

• increasing product service and price competition by international and domestic competitors including new entrants and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences evolving regulations new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis successfully introduce new products digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors or adopt to market changes relating to climate change related policies they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

• our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation 

the success of new and improved products digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand which may result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences to deliver high quality innovative and competitive products to the market to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to thirdparty technologies to provide adequate data security and privacy protections and to stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new products digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

• we could lose customers or generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations factors such as freight costs transportation availability inventory levels the level of imports the imposition of duties tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these raw materials subassemblies and components significant price increases for certain commodities other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material 

prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors 

we use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects of extended lead times or shortages may have in the future in addition some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers if a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms including at favorable prices in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected the disruption of our global supply chain for any reason including for issues such as covid19 or other health epidemics or pandemics labor disputes loss of single source or limited source supplier inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues a suppliers financial distress natural disasters looting vandalism or acts of war or terrorism trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

• our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes risks associated with emerging markets changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws regulations and policies including environmental employment and health and safety regulations data security laws data privacy laws exportimport laws tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits carbon emission regulations energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs these laws regulations and policies are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial position 

certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance or economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in income tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by governmental authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

financial and strategic risks 

• our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on crossborder transactions and the translation of local currency results into us dollars could negatively impact our results of operations 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows which are presented in us dollars crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro chinese renminbi yuan swedish krona pound sterling indian rupee singapore dollar danish 

krone and canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

• our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• the indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters 

there can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations the failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition

covid19 

the covid19 outbreak and associated counteracting measures implemented by governments and businesses around the world as well as subsequent accelerated and robust recovery in global business activity have increased uncertainty in the global business environment and led to supply chain disruptions and shortages in global markets for commodities logistics and labor as well as input cost inflation 

table of contents 

in response to covid19 we have taken and continue to take measures to protect our workforce we have modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to adhere to guidance from the us centers for disease control and prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network we have invested at the corporate center to provide oversight enhance coordination and ensure robust safety protocols are present across our operations in addition we have provided employee incentives for vaccinations and hosted vaccination clinics at a number of our facilities 

activity in most of the end markets we serve improved throughout 2021 although demand in certain businesses such as textile printing industrial winch and bearings and compression components is expected to take longer to recover to prepandemic levels with continued improvement expected in 2022 the recovery in demand has had business impacts including increased material cost inflation principally steel labor availability issues and logistics costs increases some of our businesses have also been impacted from supplier component input availability issues currently our expectation is that the impact of material cost inflation labor constraints and logistics constraints and to some extent supplier component input availability will continue into 2022 

the public health situation continued global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook we will continue to proactively respond to the situation and may take further actions that alter our business activity as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and operations

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 increased compared to 2020 this increase was primarily driven by higher earnings net of noncash adjustments and increases to accrued expenses partially offset by our investment in working capital of 3071 million 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 1595 million compared to 2019 this increase was driven primarily by improvements in working capital of 894 million payroll tax deferrals under the us cares act of 316 million and advanced payments received on contracts partially offset by lower net earnings excluding the impact of depreciation amortization loss on assets held for sale and gain on a disposition 

pension and other postretirement activity total cash used in conjunction with pension plans during 2021 was 144 million including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our nonqualified supplemental pension plans 

the funded status of our us qualified defined benefit pension plan is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements due to the overfunded status of this plan the company did not make contributions in 2021 2020 or 2019 and does not expect to make contributions in the near term 

our international pension plans are located in regions where often it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash payments which include contributions and direct benefit payments to nonfunded plans to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2021 2020 and 2019 totaled 81 million 73 million and 72 million respectively in 2022 we expect to make cash payments of approximately 77 million related to our nonus plans 

our nonqualified supplemental pension plans are funded through company assets as benefits are paid in 2021 2020 and 2019 a total of 63 million 123 million and 136 million in benefits were paid under these plans respectively see note 17 — employee benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans in 2022 we expect to make cash payments of approximately 48 million to our nonqualified us plans

adjusted working capital we believe adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue 



adjusted working capital increased from december 31 2020 by 3460 million or 309 to 15 billion at december 31 2021 which reflected an increase in accounts receivable of 2103 million an increase in inventory of 3553 million and an increase in accounts payable of 2196 million these amounts include the effects of acquisitions dispositions and foreign currency translation we continue to focus on improving working capital management accounts receivable increased compared to the prior year as a result of higher revenue we increased inventory balances throughout the year to support growing sales and backlog and also to mitigate potential inventory constraints given the continuing disrupted and constrained supply chain these factors also led to an increase in accounts payable 

we facilitate the opportunity for suppliers to participate in voluntary supply chain financing “scf” programs with participating financial institutions participating suppliers have the ability to sell receivables due from us to scf financial institutions at the discretion of both the suppliers and the scf financial institutions at no economic impact to the company the company and our suppliers agree on commercial terms including payment terms for the goods and services we procure regardless of whether the supplier participates in scf for participating suppliers our responsibility is limited to making all payments to the scf financial institutions on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier irrespective of whether the supplier elects to sell receivables to the scf financial institution the scf financial institution pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the scf financial institution  thus suppliers using scf have additional potential flexibility in managing their liquidity by accelerating at their option and cost collection of receivables due from dover 

outstanding payments related to scf programs are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2021 and 2020 amounts due to financial institutions for suppliers using scf were approximately 211 million and 139 million respectively scf related payments are classified as a reduction to cash flows from operations amounts paid to scf financial institutions were approximately 825 million during the year ended december 31 2021 and 605 million during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

investing activities 

cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds from the sale of businesses and property plant and equipment the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

• acquisitions in 2021 we deployed 11121 million excluding contingent consideration of 130 million to acquire nine businesses in comparison we acquired six businesses in 2020 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 3358 million total acquisition spend in 2019 was 2157 million and was comprised of three businesses see note 3 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions 

• proceeds from sale of businesses in 2021 we generated cash proceeds of 2750 million due to the sale of ub within the climate  sustainability technologies segment and the sale of our rwb equity method investment within the engineered products segment cash proceeds of 154 million in 2020 was due to the sale of ams chino within the climate  sustainability technologies segment in 2019 we generated cash proceeds of 242 million due to the sale of finder 

• capital spending capital expenditures primarily to support growth initiatives productivity and new product launches were 1715 million in 2021 1657 million in 2020 and 1868 million in 2019 our capital expenditures increased 58 million in 2021 compared to 2020 in line with our plan to support growth capacity digitization 

table of contents 

innovation and productivity our capital expenditures decreased 211 million in 2020 compared to 2019 as we temporarily reduced our capital spending plan as a result of covid19 without deferring strategic priorities 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2022 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper or by accessing the public debt or equity markets we estimate capital expenditures in 2022 to range from 200 million to 220 million 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relat es to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

• longterm debt commercial paper and notes payable net during 2021 we received proceeds of 1050 million from commercial paper borrowings to fund a portion of our acquisitions during 2020 we used 847 million to pay off commercial paper borrowings during 2019 we issued €500 million of 0750 eurodenominated notes due 2027 and 300 million of 2950 notes due 2029 the proceeds from the sale of eurodenominated notes of €4947 million net of discounts and issuance costs were used in part to redeem the €300 million 2125 notes due 2020 the proceeds from the sale of notes of 2969 million net of discounts and issuance costs and the remaining funds from the sale of the eurodenominated notes were used to fund the redemption of the 450 million 430 notes due 2021 the early extinguishment of debt resulted in a pretax loss of 235 million net borrowings decreased by 933 million in 2019 due to the issuance of debt early extinguishment of debt and decrease in borrowings from commercial paper 

• repurchase of common stock during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased 182951 shares of common stock at a total cost of 216 million during the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 979165 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1063 million during the year ended december 31 2019 we repurchased 1343622 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1433 million 

• dividend payments total dividend payments to common shareholders were 2869 million in 2021 2843 million in 2020 and 2822 million in 2019 our dividends paid per common share increased 1 to 199 per share in 2021 compared to 197 per share in 2020 which represents the 66th consecutive year that our dividend per share has increased the number of common shares outstanding increased from 2020 to 2021 as share issuances slightly exceeded share repurchases 

• net proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards payments to settle tax obligations on share exercises were 419 million 285 million and 374 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase from 2020 to 2021 is primarily due to the increase in the number of shares exercised and an increase in the average stock price compared to the prior year period 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that may be available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions paying dividends repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock 

table of contents 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2021 we generated free cash flow of 9444 million representing 119 of revenue and 840 of earnings free cash flow in 2020 was 9391 million or 141 of revenue and 1374 of earnings free cash flow in 2019 was 7585 million or 106 of revenue and 1119 of earnings the full year increase in 2021 free cash flow reflects higher cash flow provided by operations as previously noted partially offset by higher investments in capital expenditures compared to the prior year the decrease in free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to higher net earnings including the impact of noncash gains on dispositions the 2020 increase in free cash flow compared to 2019 reflects higher cash flow provided by operations primarily due to improvements in working capital permitted deferrals of tax payments and advanced payments received on contracts 

  

capitalization 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock as of december 31 2021 we maintained a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks which will expire on october 4 2024 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes 

beginning in earlytomidmarch 2020 the commercial paper market began to experience very high levels of volatility as a result of covid19 related uncertainties volatility was most pronounced for tier2 issuers such as dover and impacted both market access and pricing as a result on march 16 2020 the company borrowed 500 million under the credit agreement proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay all of the companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes we subsequently repaid the 500 million in the second quarter of 2020 using proceeds from commercial paper as volatility in the commercial paper market stabilized and we resumed borrowing commercial paper 

the company may elect to have loans under the credit agreement which bear interest at a base rate plus a specified applicable margin under this facility we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2021 and had a coverage ratio of 176 to 1 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants additionally our earliest longterm debt maturity is in 2025 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2021 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3855 million of which approximately 2575 million was held outside the united states at december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 5131 million of which 3459 million was held outside the united states cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks we regularly hold cash in excess of nearterm requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months 

table of contents 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders equity the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 395 at december 31 2021 compared to 434 at december 31 2020 the decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by the increase in stockholders equity of 8038 million for the period as a result of increase in current earnings of 11238 million  offset by 2869 million of dividends paid and 216 million in share repurchases net debt increased 1432 million during the period primarily due to a decrease of 1276 million in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in total debt as a result of an increase in commercial paper 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 434 at december 31 2020 compared to 468 at december 31 2019 the decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by the increase in stockholders equity of 3531 million for the period as a result of increase in current earnings of 6835 million offset by 2843 million of dividends paid and 1063 million in share repurchases net debt decreased 774 million during the period primarily due to an increase of 1158 million in cash and cash equivalents and a reduction in commercial paper partially offset by an increase in longterm debt as a result of foreign currency translation on our eurodenominated notes 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash flowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing set forth below are our credit ratings as of december 31 2021 which were independently developed by the respective credit agencies the moodys rating and outlook were issued in december 2018 and the standard  poors rating was issued in december 2017 and the outlook was most recently revised in may 2021 



as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 1559 million outstanding in letters of credit surety bonds and performance and other guarantees with financial institutions which expire on various dates through 2029 these letters of credit and bonds are primarily issued as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

our estimate of future interest payments on longterm debt is 11405 million based on the interest rates in effect as of december 31 2021 

operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions capital expenditures purchase obligations and lease obligations see note 7 — leases in the consolidated 

table of contents 

financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional details on lease obligations  acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future 

financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

as of december 31 2021 and during the three year period then ended we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts however we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixed in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2021 yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2441 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries including canada substantially all of the european countries mexico brazil china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges 

additionally we have designated the €600 million and €500 million of eurodenominated notes issued november 9 2016 and november 4 2019 respectively as a hedge of our net investment in eurodenominated operations we had also designated the €300 million notes due in 2020 as a net investment hedge prior to our redemption of the notes due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the us dollar the us dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases resulting in the recognition of a pretax gain loss of 940 million 1193 million and 224 million in other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

table of contents 

commodity price exposure 

some of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials markets for multiple raw materials most notably steel saw significant cost increases throughout 2021 which we partially offset through price increases and other levers when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations of accounting principles that affect the amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect supplemental information contained in our disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to us gaap and is consistently applied we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition  the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we include shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of goods and services see note 2 — revenue in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further details 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or net realizable value an immaterial portion of domestic inventories are stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates in addition the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist when some portion but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of or classified as assets held for sale or when a change in the composition of reporting units occurs for other reasons such as a change in segments 

when performing an impairment test we estimate fair value using the incomebased valuation method under the incomebased valuation method fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rate based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from these estimates the discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates we use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2021 reporting unit valuations ranged from 80 to 90 

table of contents 

we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2021 concluding that the fair values of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying values as such no goodwill impairment was recognized while we believe the assumptions used in the 2021 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results and reflective of a market participant actual results may differ from expectations 

employee benefit plans  the valuation of our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates annually we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual and forecasted returns economic trends and portfolio allocation our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams the plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting yearbyyear spot rates as disclosed in note 17 — employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the 2021 weightedaverage discount rate used to measure our qualified defined benefit obligations ranged from 118 to 295 a general increase from the 2020 rates which ranged from 079 to 265 the higher 2021 discount rates in the us are reflective of increased market interest rates over this period a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the postretirement benefit obligations by approximately 300 million from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2021 our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately 18 million 

income taxes  we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are evaluated for recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies unrecognized tax benefits are also estimated using more likely than not criteria for federal state and nonus tax matters we routinely monitor the potential impact of these matters and believe that the proper reserves have been established reserves related to unrecognized tax benefits and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax laws changes in statutory tax rates and future taxable income the provision for unrecognized tax benefits provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for determining the financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

risk retention insurance  we have significant accruals and reserves related to the selfretained portion of our risk management program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions our experience and relevant industry data we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 

contingencies  we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues while we believe that the amount accrued todate is adequate future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 

restructuring  we establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management or when termination benefits are communicated exit costs may include contractual terminations and asset impairments as a result of an approved restructuring plan the accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

table of contents 

dispositions  from time to time we sell or dispose of certain operations for various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and liabilities of such operations to their estimated fair value these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similartype entities the adjustments to fair value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates as noted previously in 2019 we recorded an impairment on assets held for sale due to the sale of finder in 2021 and 2020 no impairment charges were recorded due to disposed operations see note 4 — dispositions to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

stockbased compensation  we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock units and performance share awards we use the blackscholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars granted to employees the performance share awards granted in 2021 and 2020 are market condition awards and we determined the fair value using the monte carlo simulation model a binomial latticebased valuation model for information related to the assumptions used see note 15 — equity and cash incentive program to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

recent accounting standards 

see note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards 

in november 2020 the sec issued final rule release no 3310890 management’s discussion and analysis selected financial data and supplementary financial information this rule which became effective on february 10 2021 amended certain sec disclosure requirements in order to modernize simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in regulation sk specifically the amendments eliminate the requirement for selected financial data streamline the requirement to disclose supplementary financial information and amend managements discussion and analysis the final rule is applicable for fiscal years ending on or after august 9 2021 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow free cash flow as a percentage of revenue free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings net debt net capitalization net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital organic revenue growth and rightsizing and other costs are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings cash flows from operating activities debt or equity working capital revenue or restructuring costs as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings which is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level segment ebitda margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

table of contents 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio free cash flow and free cash flow ratios are important measures of liquidity net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow and free cash flow ratios provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings equals free cash flow divided by net earnings we believe that reporting adjusted working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods we believe that reporting rightsizing and other costs which include restructuring and other charges is important as it enables management and investors to better understand the financial impact of our broadbased cost reduction footprint consolidation it centralization and operational improvement initiatives

changes in internal controls 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations over internal controls 

the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets

characteristics of a dover business 

our businesses generally operate in strategically attractive niche industrial markets with supportive longterm growth trends favorable supply and demand landscapes mature and incrementally improving technologies and highly loyal customers suppliers or channel partners our businesses have consistently enjoyed a customer base that chooses products primarily based on performance in many instances our businesses produce critical equipment or components to a larger system where valueinuse and costs and risks of switching far exceed the cost of the product itself our products tend to have meaningful replacement consumable or aftermarket demand due in part to a large installed base because they play a specialized role in customer applications recurring demand which includes parts consumables services and software represents approximately 30 of our revenue our businesses increasingly complement our component or equipment offerings with 

digital solutions such as connected products sensors and software that create new sources of value to our customers and allow dover businesses to drive growth and increase relevance with our customers dover businesses also exhibit attractive financial profiles characterized by predictable stable revenue low capital intensity strong cashflow and sustainable returns on invested capital well in excess of our cost of capital 

business strategy 

to achieve our stated goals we are focused on executing the following pillars of dover’s business strategy 

capturing growth potential in our endmarkets and adjacencies 

dover’s business segments are focused on building enduring competitive advantages and leadership positions in markets that we believe are positioned for sustained future growth we believe that our businesses are among the top suppliers in most markets and niches that we serve as defined by customer applications geographies or products which positions us well to capture future growth we capitalize on our engineering technology and design expertise and maintain an intense focus on meeting the needs of our customers and adding significant and often new value to their operations through superior product performance safety and reliability and a commitment to aftermarket support we cultivate and maintain an entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve 

in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on growing industrial manufacturing and trade volumes adoption of digital technologies increasing requirements for sustainability safety energy efficiency and consumer product safety and growth of the middle class and consumption in emerging economies our engineered products segment is capitalizing on secular growth in waste generation and the increasing sophistication and automation of waste collection operations and increasing car parc car age and miles driven as well as increasing digitization and sensorization of modern vehicles our fueling solutions segment benefits from the worldwide growth in safety and compliance regulations new infrastructure buildout in emerging economies consolidation in the convenience retail sector increased sophistication and digitization of convenience stores and fuel retailing as well as a secular growth in automated vehicle wash systems and solutions over manual and doityourself washing our imaging  identification segment leverages its unique product offering containing equipment consumables software and services to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing increased demand for product traceability and brand protection and consumer product safety our pumps  process solutions segment is focused on capturing growth in its installed base and growing sophistication of fluid transfer and rotating machinery components within the chemical plastics and polymer industrial mid and downstream oil  gas biopharma and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support our refrigeration  food equipment segment is responding to our customers’ demand for increased energy efficiency and sustainability in food retail merchandising solutions as well as increasing demand for sustainable heating and cooling solutions and growing global demand for aluminum beverage cans 

we aim to grow by making organic investments in research and development developing new products and technologies improving digital capabilities expanding our geographic coverage and pursuing disciplined strategic acquisitions that will enhance our portfolio and position dover for longterm growth we continually evaluate how our assets and capabilities can position dover to grow in markets adjacent to our core businesses for example new applications geographies product segments or adjacent technologies where dover can be advantaged 

in addition to product innovation we plan to grow by developing digital technologies our bostonbased dover digital labs serves as the companywide hub for our digital initiative we have continued to invest in this facility and our team of software developers data scientists and product managers to enhance our digital capability the digital labs team is driving digital transformation across our businesses along the following three areas i enhancing the customer experience through more efficient and streamlined digital customer interfaces that make it easy to do bus iness with dover companies ii developing connected software and machine learning augmented solutions built to int egrate and work with dovers core equipment and component offerings in our endmarkets and iii driving increased efficiency safety and quality in our manufacturing operations by employing cuttingedge automation and “digital factory” solutions we believe that the digital labs center enhances the effectiveness of our products and fuels our commercial growth strategy by leveraging a central resource for industrial internet of things iiot and connected product initiatives we are able to leverage efficiency of support infrastructure improve product security and offer better efficiency in software and sensor integration engineering to keep our projects costcompetitive 

improving profitability and return on invested capital 

we are committed to generating sustainable returns on invested capital well above the cost of capital across all of our businesses we continually evaluate and pursue opportunities to improve efficiency margin and return on capital we are intensely foc used on driving operational excellence across our businesses we have implemented numerous productivity initiatives to maximize our efficiency such as supply chain integration shared services lean manufacturing principles and production automation as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees our businesses place a strong emphasis on continual product quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and to facilitate expansion into new products and geographic markets 

we also focus on our margin expansion program designed to reduce our selling general and administrative cost base and rationalize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint across the portfolio we continually expand initiatives to extract productivity gains across the businesses and realize savings our margin expansion initiatives are focused on four core enterprise capabilities 1 leverage our digital labs team to enhance our digital capabilities 2 improve utilization and optimization of our manufacturing footprint through centralized resources and investment 3 further centralize shared services under dover business services and 4 invest in our india innovation center shared services 

our dover digital labs consists of a team of approximately 100 software developers data scientists and product managers who provide digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience develop connected products and drive automation and efficiency inside our factories through digital technologies and in our business processes our dover digital leadership has built common platforms which we have begun deploying on customer facing applications to make it easier to find configure buy and obtain service on products from dover companies the dover digital labs team has also deployed shared iiot capability so many of dovers products are remotely configurable and monitored enabling our businesses to sell aftermarket parts and offer remote diagnostic services 

in 2019 we began to coordinate and oversee operations management from the corporate center of excellence this team comprised of a small group of functional experts works closely with our businesses to drive execution excellence in our operational initiatives and bestinclass processes standards and measurement tools to identify prioritize and monitor execution of operational improvement initiatives the operations center of excellence has expertise in health and safety supply chain management lean operations project management and advanced manufacturing and automation we continue to focus on initiatives to improve operational efficiency and enhance and solidify the continuous improvement programs embedded in our businesses daytoday operations such as significant production automation and footprint consolidation projects

our india innovation center has a team of approximately 500 people that our businesses can leverage for product engineering digital solutions development data  information management research  development and intellectual property services the scale and expertise of this team allows our businesses to access resources that would be unaffordable to them as standalone companies and allows for concurrent engineering on time sensitive projects 

additionally we focus on improving margins and returns by rigorously capturing synergies from our acquisitions and providing bestinclass corporate support and services through a lean corporate center 

disciplined capital allocation and continuous portfolio enhancement 

we are focused on the most efficient allocation of capital to maximize returns on investment to do this we prioritize organic reinvestment to grow and strengthen our existing businesses we plan to make average annual investments in capital spending of approximately 2  4 of revenue with a focus on internal projects designed to expand our market participation develop new products and improve productivity we seek to deploy capital in acquisitions in attractive growth areas across our five segments dover focuses primarily on bolton acquisitions applying strict selection criteria of market attractiveness including growth maturity and performancebased competition business fit including sustained leading position revenue visibility and favorable customer valueadd versus switching cost or risk and financial return profile accretive growth and margins and doubledigit return on capital we opportunistically divest businesses where we see limited runway for future value creation in line with our aspirations or where market and business fundamentals change and no longer fit our criteria of business attractiveness and portfolio fit finally we have consistently returned cash to shareholders by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 65 years we undertake opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy we employ a prudent financial policy to support our capital allocation strategy which includes maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

portfolio development 

acquisitions 

our acquisition program has two key elements as a first priority we seek to acquire attractive addon businesses with a strong fit that enhance our existing franchises either by increasing their reach and customer access by broadening their product mix or by enhancing technological capability and customer valueadd second in the right circumstances we may strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that complement our existing businesses or provide a path for us to pursue growth in near adjacencies with all our acquisitions we seek businesses that are leaders in their markets or niches have a strong track record for innovation offer differentiated solutions clearly complement our businesses and have a solid organic growth profile attractive and sustainable returns and offer significant synergy potential to generate doubledigit return on capital within three years after the acquisition is completed 

over the past three years 2018 through 2020 we have spent approximately 6207 million to purchase eleven businesses during 2020 we acquired six businesses for an aggregate consideration of 3358 million net of cash acquired consistent with our acquisition program we acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the engineered products fueling solutions imaging  identification and pumps  process solutions segments during 2019 we acquired three businesses for an aggregate consideration of 2164 million net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration we acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the fueling solutions and pumps  process solutions segments during 2018 we acquired two businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 686 million net of cash acquired within the pumps  process solutions and refrigeration  food equipment segments for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past three years see note 4 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses that expand the scope of our offerings and make us an even more important supplier to our customers while we expect to generate annual organic revenue growth of 3  5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary adverse economic conditions our success in consistently growing the portfolio is also dependent on the ability to acquire and integrate businesses successfully within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal scorecard and welldefined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created 

dispositions 

we have sold or divested some of our businesses based on changes in specific market outlook structural changes in financial performance valuecreation potential or for other strategic considerations which included an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets or focus on our higher margin growth spaces most of our efforts to streamline and improve the portfolio to less cyclical and higher growth businesses were completed in 2018 with the apergy spinoff 

going forward we recognize that some businesses in dover’s portfolio may have a greater valuecreation potential if owned by another parent with a larger presence and focus on a given niche we pragmatically consider such opportunities as part of our ongoing portfolio management and review processes and execute divestitures if the value created is determined to be at an appropriate premium to the value of such business to dover and allows dover shareholders to participate in the future valuecreation potential from a change in ownership 

during the past three years 2018 through 2020 we have sold businesses for aggregate cash consideration of 436 million during 2020 and 2019 we completed the sales of the chino california branch of the ams group ams chino in the refrigeration  food equipment segment and finder pompe srl finder within the pumps  process solutions segment respectively during 2018 there were no other material dispositions aside from the spinoff of apergy as previously discussed the financial position and results of operations for apergy have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented the disposals in 2020 and 2019 did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations for more details see note 5 — discontinued and disposed operations in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing can be volatile particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such 

fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been created registered or acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers none of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2020 given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are not significant businesses supplying the environmental solutions defense automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

seasonality 

in general while our businesses are not highly seasonal we do tend to have stronger revenue generation in the second half of the year which is driven by customer capital expenditure timing and seasonal activity patterns in our endmarkets our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase in the second half of the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends which moderates the aforementioned seasonality patterns our food retail refrigeration business tends to face higher levels of demand in the second and third quarters as retailers avoid construction and remodeling activity during fallwinter holidays 

competition 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation a summary of our key competitors within each of our segments follows 



international 

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we aim to increase our revenue in international markets particularly in developing economies in asia the middle east eastern europe and south america 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in china france germany italy sweden switzerland the united kingdom and other locations including australia brazil canada india mexico and the netherlands 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 20 — segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

sustainability 

we are committed to creating economic value for shareholders by developing products designed to help our customers meet their sustainability goals run their operations more efficiently and satisfy evolving regulatory and environmental standards we believe that sustainabilitydriven innovation in response to customer demand helps us contribute positively to enhanced resource efficiency and waste reduction while presenting a valuable growth opportunity we highlight key initiatives and performance metrics about our sustainability activities under the “sustainability” tab on our website wwwdovercorporationcom 

other matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in passthrough costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

business and operational risks 

• the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and poses risks to our business the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our business including demand for our products across multiple endmarkets as well as our supply chain and operations while we have experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies the public health situation global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook accordingly we are currently unable to quantify the full and longterm impact of the pandemic on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are monitoring the global outbreak of covid19 and taking steps to mitigate its risks by working with our customers employees suppliers and other stakeholders significant portions of our workforce and operations have been impacted by quarantines government orders and guidance facility closures illness travel restrictions implementation of precautionary measures and other restrictions over the course of the pandemic we have continued to operate in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities while maintaining an enhanced health and safety compliance program more specifically we have modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to adhere to guidance from the us centers for disease control and prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network with respect to social distancing physical separation personal protective equipment and sanitization and have restricted the number of employees permitted in common areas at any given time further actions may be required as conditions evolve including if new waves of infection emerge in various parts of the globe or until a vaccine is widely available in addition because the pandemic has decreased customer demand in many of our endmarkets some of our businesses have continued to operate at reduced capacity we cannot predict the number or timing of any future facility closures the potential for operating at reduced capacity or the size of the workforce that may be impacted by potential labor actions such as furloughs or layoffs 

the covid19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt our supply chain as a result of shifts in demand illness quarantine travel restrictions or financial hardship we have been able to procure the critical raw materials and components necessary to continue production of our products but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future in addition we may experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities costs customer orders and purchases and our collections of accounts receivable which may be material and the extent of these adverse impacts on future operational and commercial activities costs customer orders and purchases and our collections remains uncertain even if conditions begin to improve 

furthermore the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates due to the unprecedented and sustained social and economic consequences of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy generally there is uncertainty around its duration and the timing of recovery the ultimate significance of the covid19 pandemic including any measures to reduce its spread on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• we are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets 

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic had a greater impact on revenue from international markets compared to the united states resulting in a greater rate of decline as a result approximately 45 of our revenues for 2020 as compared to approximately 47 in 2019 were derived outside the united states this was mostly in europe and china 

we will continue to focus on global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• our operations businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks 

we depend on our own and third party it systems including cloudbased systems and managed service providers to store process and protect our information and support our business activities we also use our third party it systems to support employee data processing for our global work force and to support customer business activities such as transmitting payment information providing mobile monitoring services and capturing operational data additionally some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks increasingly our customers including government customers are requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards for our products our business has both an increasing reliance on it systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies connected devices and digital offerings as well as expanded remote work policies if these technologies systems products or services are damaged cease to function properly are compromised due to employee or thirdparty contractor error user error malfeasance system errors or other vulnerabilities or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving denial of service attacks unauthorized access malicious software or other intrusions including by criminals nation states or insiders our business may be adversely impacted the impacts could include production downtimes operational delays and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers compromise of confidential proprietary or otherwise protected information including personal information and customer confidential data destruction corruption or theft of data or intellectual property manipulation disruption or improper use of these technologies systems products or services financial losses from fraudulent transactions remedial actions loss of business or potential liability adverse media coverage and legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations actions and fines and damage to our reputation there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information 

generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers by both statesponsored and criminal organizations moreover there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds 

these trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks it is possible for vulnerabilities in our it systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training systems monitoring and other technical security controls a breach response plan maintenance of backup and protective systems and security personnel not withstanding those measures our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows we and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations are regularly the target of and periodically respond to cyberattacks including phishing and denialofservice attacks and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption in addition a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it and actions decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business results of operations and reputation while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise as cyber threats continue to evolve cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the us and globally and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more internetenabled products and offerings we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs strengthen our information security data protection and business continuity measures and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities 

• unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances or claims related to patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects to cause property damage to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures which would reduce operating profit and cash flow in addition a product recall may require significant management attention product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our revenue operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights our businesses employ various measures to develop maintain and protect their intellectual property rights these measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of our businesses intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

industry risks 

• increasing productservice and price competition by international and domestic competitors including new entrants and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences evolving regulations new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

• our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation 

the success of new and improved products digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand which may result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences to deliver high quality innovative and competitive products to the market to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to thirdparty technologies to provide adequate data security and privacy protections and to stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new products digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

• we could lose customers or generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations factors such as freight costs transportation availability inventory levels the level of imports the imposition of duties tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these raw materials subassemblies and components significant price increases for certain commodities other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors 

we use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effects of extended lead times or shortages may have in the future in addition some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers if a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms including at favorable prices in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or a shortage in or the unavailability of raw materials or components may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

• our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes risks associated with emerging markets changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws regulations and policies including environmental employment and health and safety regulations data security laws data privacy laws exportimport laws tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits carbon emission regulations energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs these laws regulations and policies are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates in addition the united kingdoms exit from the european union common market and the terms of the uk eu trade and cooperation agreement may impact our market access and pricing compliance with regulatory requirements and ability to hire and maintain personnel any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial position 

certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance or economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

financial and strategic risks 

• our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on crossborder transactions and the translation of local currency results into us dollars could negatively impact our results of operations 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows which are presented in us dollars crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro chinese renminbi yuan swedish krona pound sterling indian rupee singapore dollar danish krone and canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and 

us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

• our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• if the apergy spinoff together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with the spinoff of apergy we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs ruling together with an opinion of mcdermott will  emery llp our tax counsel substantially to the effect that among other things certain transactions to effect the spinoff will qualify as a taxfree reorganization for us federal income tax purposes under section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” and the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution to our shareholders under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and apergy including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion in addition we and apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment we would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if we had sold the apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the apergy common stock received in the distribution in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law we could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law respectively 

• the indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we have retained certain liabilities directly or 

through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters 

in connection with the spinoff apergy agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the apergy business there can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations the failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

labor and employment risks 

• our reputation ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate united states andor nonunited states laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims competition export and import compliance environmental compliance money laundering and data privacy as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• if we experience work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we have a number of collective bargaining units in the united states and various foreign collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity reputation consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows

overview 

dover corporation is a diversified global manufacturer and solutions provider delivering innovative equipment and components consumable supplies aftermarket parts software and digital solutions and support services 

for the year ended december 31 2020 consolidated revenue was 67 billion a decrease of 05 billion or 63 as compared to the prior year this decline included an organic revenue decline of 66 driven by covid19 and a 07 impact from dispositions partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 10 overall customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 07 for the year 

within our engineered products segment revenue decreased 1663 million or 98 from the prior year reflecting a broadbased organic revenue decline of 103 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 03 and a favorable foreign currency translation of 02 the organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the global economic downturn precipitated by the covid19 pandemic the impact was broadbased across the segment with the most significant impacts experienced in our waste handling industrial winch and hoist industrial automation and fluid dispensing businesses 

our fueling solutions segment revenue decreased 1439 million or 89 from prior year reflecting an organic decline of 88 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 03 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 02 the organic revenue decline was principally driven by the adverse effects of covid19 and reduced underground equipment volume in china due to the tapering of governmentmandated infrastructure upgrades 

our imaging  identification segment revenue decreased 463 million or 43 from the prior year comprised of organic decline of 72 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 10 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 39 the organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the global economic downturn precipitated by the covid19 pandemic which materially impacted our digital textile printing business as governmentmandated clothing and apparel retail closures and widespread practice of working from home reduced demand worldwide for apparel and textiles 

our pumps  process solutions segment revenue decreased 145 million or 11 from the prior year attributable to an organic decline of 23 and a 05 decrease from a disposition partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 11 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 06 the organic revenue decline was principally driven by continued weakness in demand for compression components and aftermarket services as well as continued slower demand for industrial pumps due to pandemicrelated disruptions and weaker activity in the energy industry which was partially offset by strong performance in the biopharma and plastics  polymers markets 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue decreased 805 million or 58 from the prior year reflecting an organic revenue decline of 30 and a disposition related decline of 29 partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 01 the organic decline was due to the impact of covid19 as government actions to contain the spread of the virus as well as atypically high volume of retail grocery sales during the early staged of the pandemic resulted 

in deferred customer orders and operational inefficiencies across the segment the decline was partially offset by increased project activity in canshaping equipment 

from a geographic perspective organic revenue for the us our largest market declined 31 while organic revenue in europe and asia declined 85 and 135 respectively year over year organic revenue in all other geographic markets declined 112 three out of our five segments experienced declines in us organic sales while organic sales in the fueling solutions and refrigeration  food equipment segments grew 38 and 23 respectively operational and demand headwinds from the covid19 pandemic led to a decline in europe for four of our five segments while the pumps  process solutions segment grew 07 the decline in asia was driven mainly by a reduction in china where our fueling solutions segment our second largest business in china faced significant headwinds due to the expiration of the governments doublewall upgrade mandate that drove significant activity in prior years as well as continued slower demand from the local national oil companies 

gross profit was 25 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 a decrease of 1469 million or 56 as compared to the prior year gross profit decreased due to lower revenue as productivity initiatives including prior rightsizing programs and cost containment actions were partially offset by increased material costs and inflation and higher restructuring costs gross profit margin expanded to 370 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 367 for the prior year for further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results see consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations respectively within mda 

bookings decreased 44 over the prior year to 69 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 this included an organic bookings decline of 46 a 06 decline due to dispositions and an unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange rate of 02 partially offset by a 10 increase in acquisitionrelated bookings bookings declined organically in four segments primarily as a result of the global impact on customer demand from the covid19 pandemic and increased in our refrigeration  food equipment on the back of positive trends most significantly in canshaping as well as food retail and heat exchanger markets overall our booktobill increased from the prior year to 104 backlog as of december 31 2020 was 18 billion up from 15 billion from the prior year the increase in backlog occurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 as order rates sequentially improved after a significant second quarter decline due to covid19 backlog as of december 31 2020 included 05 billion 02 billion 02 billion 04 billion and 05 billion in the engineered products fueling solutions imaging  identification pumps  process solutions and refrigeration  food equipment segments respectively see definition of bookings organic bookings booktobill and backlog within segment results of operations 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we executed rightsizing programs to further optimize operations rightsizing charges of 515 million included restructuring charges of 445 million and other costs of 70 million restructuring expense was comprised primarily of new actions executed in response to lower demand driven by covid19 as well as continuing broadbased selling general and administrative expense reduction initiatives and broadbased operational efficiency initiatives focusing on footprint consolidation and operational optimization and it centralization these restructuring charges were broadbased across all segments as well as corporate with costs incurred of 103 million in engineered products 67 million in fueling solutions 59 million in imaging  identification 134 million in pumps  process solutions 40 million in refrigeration  food equipment and 41 million at corporate other costs were comprised primarily of charges related to the restructuring actions and asset charges principally due to a 36 million write off of assets partially offset by a 17 million gain on sale of assets in our refrigeration  food equipment segment additional programs beyond the scope of the announced programs may be implemented during 2021 with related restructuring charges

our foremost focus as we respond to the pandemic has been on the health and safety of our employees we have enhanced health and safety measures across our facilities including modifying practices to adhere to guidance from the us centers for disease control and prevention and local health and governmental authorities with respect to social distancing physical separation personal protective equipment and sanitization we also restricted the number of employees permitted in common areas at any given time we enhanced our operational excellence model by memorializing our approach to sanitized manufacturing which includes procedures for dealing with confirmed covid19 cases compliance auditing and manufacturing line design we will continue to closely monitor the risks posed by covid19 and adjust our practices accordingly 

we consider our companies to be essential suppliers to our customers and business partners as we provide products and services on which our customers and broader society rely upon daily to support crucial functions therefore most of our us and global facilities have remained substantially operational during the outbreak with enhanced safety protocols to protect the wellbeing of our employees 

in order to help mitigate the negative financial impact caused by the pandemic beginning late in the first quarter we executed a number of temporary cost savings measures across the portfolio and at our corporate center including shortterm workforce rightsizing actions adjustments to variable compensation to reflect current conditions elimination of nonessential travel and reduction of discretionary spending we also reduced our capital spending for the year without deferring strategic ongoing initiatives in addition we initiated restructuring actions to drive longerterm cost savings and are proactively managing our working capital 

over the course of 2020 we experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies though demand remains lower than historical averages across markets that we expect will take longer to fully recover like our food equipment and digital textile businesses however given sequential improvements in bookings in a majority of our markets late in 2020 and a higher year over year backlog we expect continued improvement in our financial results in 2021 

the public health situation global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook we will continue to proactively respond to the situation and may take further actions that alter our business activity as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and operations

for the year ended december 31 2019 revenue increased 1443 million or 21 to 71 billion compared with 2018 reflecting organic growth of 38 led by our fueling solutions and engineered products segments partially offset by our refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue also increased due to acquisitionrelated growth of 08 from our pumps  process solutions and fueling solutions segments partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 20 particularly in our fueling solutions and imaging and identification segments and a 05 impact from dispositions within our pumps  process solutions and fueling solutions segments customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 10 in 2019 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2020 gross profit decreased 1469 million or 56 to 25 billion compared with 2019 primarily due to lower revenue as productivity initiatives including prior rightsizing programs and cost containment actions were partially offset by increased material costs and inflation and higher restructuring costs gross profit margin expanded 30 basis points to 370 as compared to the prior year due to benefits from productivity initiatives and restructuring and cost containment actions we are managing production at our operating plants aggressively to match demand 

for the year ended december 31 2019 gross profit increased 614 million or 24 to 26 billion compared with 2018 primarily due to organic volume growth pricing actions and productivity initiatives including the benefits of rightsizing actions and cost reduction initiatives as well as reduced rightsizing costs partially offset by increased material costs due in part to us section 232 and 301 tariff exposure gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 367 as compared to the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 581 million or 36 to 15 billion compared with 2019 due to reduction in discretionary spend and benefits from rightsizing actions partially offset by higher restructuring costs of 77 million and a 36 million writeoff of assets as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased 70 basis points in 2020 to 231 reflecting the decrease in revenue base 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 1173 million or 68 to 16 billion compared with 2018 primarily due to benefits from rightsizing actions started in 2018 and a decrease in restructuring costs of 237 million as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased 210 basis points in 2019 to 224 reflecting the leverage of costs on a higher revenue base and the decrease in expenses 

research and development costs including qualifying engineering costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to 1421 million 1410 million and 1430 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively these costs as a percent of revenue were 21 20 and 20 for the years december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

loss on assets held for sale 

on march 29 2019 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell finder for total consideration of approximately 236 million net of estimated selling costs as of march 31 2019 finder met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and based on the total consideration from the sale net of selling costs we recorded a loss on the assets held for sale of 469 million the loss was comprised of an impairment on assets held for sale of 216 million and foreign currency translation losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive losses to current earnings of 253 million we subsequently sold finder on april 2 2019 which generated total cash proceeds of 242 million 

nonoperating items 

interest expense net 

for the year ended december 31 2020 interest expense net of interest income decreased 129 million or 107 to 1084 million compared with 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates on new debt issued in november 2019 of €500 million of 0750 notes due 2027 and 300 million of 2950 notes due 2029 the new notes repaid the old debt of €300 million of 2125 notes and 450 million of 430 notes which carried higher interest rates 

for the year ended december 31 2019 interest expense net of interest income decreased 08 million or 07 to 1213 million compared with 2018 due to the 350 million 545 10year notes that were paid in march 2018 that resulted in lower outstanding longterm debt and lower interest expense compared to 2018 partially offset by lower interest income 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

on december 4 2019 the company extinguished the €300 million of 2125 notes due 2020 and the 450 million of 430 notes due 2021 the company was required to pay a make whole premium to the bondholders for the early extinguishment of debt resulting in a loss of 235 million 

gain on sale of business 

on march 6 2020 we sold ams chino within the refrigeration  food equipment segment for total consideration of 154 million which included a working capital adjustment a gain of 52 million was recognized on this sale the disposal did not represent a strategic shift in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations 

there were no dispositions in the year 2019 aside from the sale of finder as described above and no significant dispositions in 2018 aside from the spinoff of apergy whose results are presented as discontinued operations 

other income net 

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 other income net was 119 million 130 million and 44 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2020 other income decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to decreased earnings from our equity method investments and increased foreign exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances for the year ended december 31 2019 other income increased compared to 2018 primarily due to increased earnings from our equity method investments and reduction of nonoperating losses from our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 

income taxes 

our businesses have a global presence with 45 47 and 52 of our pretax earnings in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively generated in foreign jurisdictions foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that differ from the 210 us statutory tax rate as a result for our nonus business locations our effective foreign tax rate is typically lower than the us statutory tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 188 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 196 and 185 for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively the 2020 2019 and 2018 rates were impacted by 222 million266 million and 240 million respectively of favorable net discrete items primarily driven by the tax benefit of share award exercises

segment results of operations 

  

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our five operating and reportable segments engineered products fueling solutions imaging  identification pumps  process solutions and refrigeration  food equipment each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple markets see note 20 — segment information in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a reconciliation of segment revenue earnings and margin to our consolidated revenue earnings from continuing operations and margin segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to segment earnings ebit as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors for further information see nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

additionally we believe the following operational metrics are useful to investors and others users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments 

• bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period this metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends 

• organic bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions the metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends 

• backlog represents an estimate of the total remaining bookings at a point in time for which performance obligations have not yet been satisfied this metric is useful as it represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future 

• booktobill is a ratio of the amount of bookings received from customers during a period divided by the amount of revenue recorded during that same period this metric is a useful indicator of demand 

engineered products 

our engineered products segment is a provider of a wide range of products software and services that have broad customer applications across a number of markets including aftermarket vehicle service solid waste handling industrial automation aerospace and defense industrial winch and hoist and fluid dispensing 



2020 versus 2019 

engineered products segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 1663 million or 98 compared to the prior year comprised of a broadbased organic revenue decline of 103 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 03 and a favorable foreign currency translation of 02 acquisitionrelated growth was driven by the acquisition of softpak customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 03 in 2020 

the organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the global economic downturn precipitated by the covid19 pandemic beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 the impact was broadbased across the segment with the most significant impacts in the year experienced in our waste handling industrial winch and hoist industrial automation and fluid dispensing businesses in waste handling we experienced headwinds in new order activity as waste haulers and municipalities reduced capital budgets to preserve cash flow and orders for compaction and recycling solutions remained below prior year levels demand for vehicle aftermarket equipment was also subdued due to reduced driving mileage and vehicle service demand headwinds from the covid19 pandemic were more significant in the first half of the year and persisted to a lesser extent into the second half of the year across our businesses despite theses headwinds activity improved sequentially from the second quarter into the second half of the year in a number of businesses most notably in our vehicle service industrial automation and fluid dispensing businesses as government mandated restrictions eased and customer demand accelerated our aerospace  defense business demonstrated resilience despite the challenges of covid19 posting year over year revenue growth on the back of stable demand from longterm defense programs 

while market headwinds for capital equipment across some of our businesses persist we expect that demand for our products will continue to improve sequentially into 2021 as evidenced by strong order rates and a strong backlog in the fourth quarter 

of 2020 we also remain confident that the fundamental longterm demand drivers across our endmarkets remain constructive and thus continue to believe in the longterm growth trajectory of the segment 

engineered products segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 537 million or 184 compared to the prior year this decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the covid19 pandemic on customer spending partially offset by cost containment initiatives we executed in the year these initiatives include actions to adjust direct and indirect manufacturing costs to current demand levels the execution of shortterm actions to reduce labor costs the elimination of nonessential travel third party and other expenses the recognition of adjustments to variable compensation to reflect current conditions the execution of selective structural cost actions aimed at streamlining our businesses and a detailed review and reprioritization of all planned investments and hiring plans segment margin decreased from 172 to 156 as compared to the prior year 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 88 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic decline of 95 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 04 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 03 the organic bookings decline was broadbased and primarily driven by the global impact on customer demand of the covid19 pandemic segment booktobill was 102 backlog increased 26 compared to the prior year with particular strength seen in our vehicle service industrial automation and aerospace and defense businesses 

2019 versus 2018 

engineered products segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 644 million or 39 compared to the prior year comprised of broadbased organic growth of 54 partially offset by a 15 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation organic revenue growth was driven by strong activity in the refuse truck and digital solutions product lines within our waste handling business as well as solid revenue growth in our vehicle service business customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 19 in 2019 

engineered products segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 395 million or 156 compared to the prior year this increase was primarily driven by solid conversion on organic volume growth pricing actions and productivity initiatives including the benefits of rightsizing actions and cost reduction initiatives as well as a reduction in rightsizing costs these benefits more than offset increases in material costs driven by us section 232 tariffs most notably commodity cost increases impacting steel and section 301 tariffs along with unfavorable foreign currency translation segment margin increased from 155 to 172 as compared to the prior year 

fueling solutions 

our fueling solutions segment is focused on providing components equipment and software and service solutions enabling safe transport of fuels and other hazardous fluids along the supply chain as well as the safe and efficient operation of retail fueling and vehicle wash establishments 



2020 versus 2019 

fueling solutions segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 1439 million or 89 compared to the prior year attributable to an organic decline of 88 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 03 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 02 customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 10 in 2020 

the organic revenue decline was principally driven by the adverse effects of covid19 and the measures taken to reduce its spread globally the negative impact started during the latter part of the first quarter in 2020 with several mandated manufacturing plant shutdowns temporarily disrupting our global operations and supply chain followed by a reduction in customer demand particularly from verticallyintegrated oil  gas companies further adding to the decline in organic revenue was reduced underground equipment volume in china due to the tapering of governmentmandated infrastructure upgrades additionally our businesses serving the transportation and rail markets experienced slow order rates due to volatile oil prices and the resulting reduction in capital budgets of verticallyintegrated international oil companies activity in the vehicle wash market was subdued due to governmentmandated shutdowns in the first half of the year and slower new capital spending activity by independent operators due to general economic uncertainty despite the global decrease in sales north america was favorably impacted by continued strong demand for europay mastercard and visa emvcompliant equipment throughout the year headwinds were also partially offset by robust performance in mexico due to the growing demand in fueling dispenser volume 

while we anticipate the tapering of north america emv volume in 2021 due to the compliance deadline recent new product introductions recovery in global market demand and growth in our software and solutions business is expected to provide 

growth within the retail fueling markets our vehicle wash business is also supported by a healthy backlog of orders given improving recent order activity our rail and transportation market is expected to remain subdued due to the challenging dynamics within the oil and transport industry 

fueling solutions segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 51 million or 22 compared to the prior year the increase was driven by favorable pricing initiatives restructuring benefits productivity actions selling general and administrative cost containment and favorable impact from foreign currency translation these benefits were partially offset by weakened organic volume due to covid19 segment margin increased 180 basis points compared to the prior year 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 88 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic decline of 80 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 10 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 02 the organic bookings decline was primarily driven by the global impact on customer demand caused by the covid19 pandemic slower demand from verticallyintegrated oil companies and prior year bookings reflected increased orders of underground equipment in china due to governmentmandated site infrastructure upgrade activity that has since tapered this was partially offset by high order trends for emv equipment in north america segment book to bill was 100 backlog decreased 21 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of lower second and third quarter bookings 

2019 versus 2018 

fueling solutions segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 1546 million or 105 compared to the prior year attributable to organic growth of 105 and acquisitionrelated growth of 34 partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 30 and a 04 decrease from a disposition the organic growth was principally driven by continued strong demand in the global retail fueling industry particularly in the united states europe and asia growth was also driven by the acquisition of belanger customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 10 in 2019 

fueling solutions segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 796 million or 523 compared to the prior year the increase was driven by volume leverage pricing initiatives productivity actions acquisitions and benefits of selling general and administrative cost reductions realized as well as decreased rightsizing costs this growth was partially offset by increased material costs due in part to us section 232 and 301 tariff exposure segment margin increased 390 basis points compared to the prior year 

imaging  identification 

our imaging  identification segment supplies precision marking and coding product traceability and digital textile printing equipment as well as related consumables software and services 



2020 versus 2019 

imaging  identification segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 463 million or 43 compared to the prior year comprised of organic decline of 72 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 10 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 39 acquisitionrelated growth was driven by the acquisition of systech in the first quarter and solaris which closed in the third quarter customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 07 in 2020 

the organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the global economic downturn precipitated by the covid19 pandemic beginning late in the first quarter which materially impacted our digital textile printing business as governmentmandated mobility restrictions forced clothing and apparel retailers to close locations and resulted in the decline of overall demand for clothing and apparel as fewer consumers went to schools offices restaurants and other gatherings digital textile printing activity has improved since the second quarter of the year especially in sportswear and home decor markets however demand for capital equipment for apparel printing remains slower compared to the prior year as we exit 2020 this dynamic resulted in improving demand from the second quarter to the second half of the year for inks and consumables that are closely linked to current levels of activity while we experienced a slower recovery in demand for new equipment purchases as customers remained focused on cash preservation our largest business in this segment marking and coding posted a modest revenue decline for the year as we saw solid demand for consumables throughout the year particularly inks for food and beverage cleaning supplies pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and strong second half growth in demand for equipment as customers resumed equipment purchases in the second half of 2020 as covid19 restrictions eased and marking and coding activity remained solid 

we expect our marking and coding business to remain resilient and anticipate a favorable longterm growth trend supported by constructive secular trends in demand for product traceability identification differentiation and brand protection solutions we expect continued sequential improvement in activity in our digital printing business as printing activity and overall demand for textiles continues to improve however uncertainty remains due to the direct impact that the covid19 pandemic has had on demand in the clothing and apparel industry despite those nearterm challenges we believe we remain favorably positioned to exploit a longerterm transition from analog to digital printing by our customers and believe some business model shifts within the industry driven by the covid19 pandemic may accelerate our customers’ need to shift from analog to digital printing 

imaging  identification segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 360 million or 157 compared to the prior year this decrease was primarily driven by the impact of continued reduced consumer spending due to covid19 on clothing sports apparel and other textile products that impact our digital printing customers partially offsetting this decrease were continued cost containment initiatives during the year these initiatives included actions to adjust direct and indirect manufacturing cost to current demand levels the execution of shortterm actions to reduce labor costs the elimination of nonessential travel third party and other expenses the recognition of adjustments to variable compensation to reflect current conditions the execution of selective structural cost actions aimed at streamlining our business and a detailed review and reprioritization of all planned investments and hiring plans these actions have been taken deliberately and strategically and have allowed us to rationalize current spending to levels appropriate given nearterm market conditions while preserving our ability to capitalize on longterm secular growth trends as a result segment margin decreased from 212 to 186 as compared to the prior year 

segment bookings for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 25 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic decline of 63 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 10 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 48 the organic reduction was primarily the result of a year over year reduction in new orders for equipment and consumables in our digital printing business segment booktobill was 103 backlog increased 533 compared to the prior year driven by the systech and solaris acquisitions and strong order intake in marking and coding 

2019 versus 2018 

imaging  identification segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 254 million or 23 compared to the prior year comprised of organic growth of 12 more than offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 35 the organic revenue growth was driven by increased equipment shipments and expanded service revenue in our marking and coding business along with increased service revenue and increased printer and ink volumes in our digital printing business the significant foreign currency impact was due to our broad international customer base in particular in asia and europe customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 10 in 2019 

imaging  identification segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 306 million or 154 compared to the prior year this increase was primarily driven by productivity initiatives including the benefits of restructuring actions favorable pricing and conversion on revenue growth as well as reduced rightsizing costs as a result segment margin increased from 179 to 212 as compared to the prior year 

pumps  process solutions 

our pumps  process solutions segment manufactures specialty pumps fluid handling components plastics and polymer processing equipment single use pumps flow meters and connectors and highly engineered components for rotating and reciprocating machines 



1 segment earnings ebit and segment ebitda for 2019 include a 46946 loss on assets held for sale for finder 

2020 versus 2019 

pumps  process solutions segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 145 million or 11 compared to the prior year attributable to organic decline of 23 and a 05 decrease from a disposition partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 11 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 06 customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 10 in 2020 

the organic revenue decline was principally driven by continued comparable weakness in demand for compression components and aftermarket services due to lower activity in the north american upstream midstream and downstream energy sector as well as continued slower demand for industrial pumps due to pandemicrelated disruptions the decline was offset by strong performance in the biopharma and hygienic markets as well as robust demand in specialty pumps for defense applications and strong shipments against a significant backlog in the plastics  polymer processing business 

the strong bookings growth in the biopharma and hygienic markets during the fourth quarter of 2020 is expected to continue into 2021 as the underlying robust longterm growth in singleuse bioproduction technologies is further supported by demand for covid19 related therapies and vaccines we also expect increasing demand outside the us across the segment and expect modest recovery in the energy industry 

pumps  process solutions segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 652 million or 272 compared to the prior year segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 included a loss on assets held for sale for finder of 469 million excluding the loss segment earnings increased as a result of pricing initiatives productivity

bookings for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 43 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic decline of 48 and a disposition related decline of 05 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 07 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 03 the organic bookings decline was primarily driven by the continued covid19 global impact on customer demand as well as a high comparable benchmark from the prior year driven by large government orders partially offset by growth in the biopharma and hygienic markets segment book to bill was 101 backlog increased 105 compared to the prior year primarily driven by our biopharma and hygienic markets 

2019 versus 2018 

pumps  process solutions segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 66 million or 05 compared to the prior year attributable to organic growth of 39 and acquisitionrelated growth of 05 this increase was partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 19 and a 20 decrease from a disposition the organic growth was principally driven by biopharma and thermal management markets along with strong continued demand from our oem customers for rotating and reciprocating machinery components customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 14 in 2019 

pumps  process solutions segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 25 million or 11 compared to the prior year segment earnings included a loss on assets held for sale for finder in the first quarter of 2019 of 469 million segment earnings increased significantly excluding the loss on sale of finder driven by volume leverage pricing initiatives and productivity actions as well as reduced rightsizing costs these benefits were partially offset by increased material costs due in part to us section 232 and 301 tariff exposure inflation costs and unfavorable product and regional mix segment margin increased to 179 from 178 in the prior year an increase of 10 basis points

2020 versus 2019 

refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 805 million or 58 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic revenue decline of 30 a disposition related decline of 29 partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 01 customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 03 in 2020 

the organic revenue decline was principally driven by the impact of covid19 on a global basis government actions to contain the spread of the virus such as mandated plant shutdowns and restaurant curtailments resulted in deferred customer orders and operational inefficiencies across the segment many key customers in our retail refrigeration business deferred previously planned projects related to new store construction and existing store remodels to focus on maximizing store uptime and meeting the needs of increased customer buying resulting from more at home consumption as well as restaurant closure mandates these impacts were incurred most significantly in the first and second quarters and to a lesser extent in the third and fourth quarters with the exception of commercial us foodservice where the impacts lingered throughout the year due to ongoing government restrictions on restaurant operations and closure of many school and conference center kitchens some of our businesses experienced a solid recovery in the third and fourth quarters with organic growth for the segment at 26 and 132 respectively driven by increased project activity in canshaping equipment a resumption of remodel programs with key retail refrigeration customers and strengthening heat exchanger demand across all regions 

we expect continued strength in the aluminum canshaping market driven by two key factors 1 a secular shift with beverage companies switching from plastic to aluminum containers for environmental and other reasons and 2 an increase in demand for canned food and beverages due to the recent covid19 related consumer shift to more athome consumption the increased fourth quarter demand for retail refrigeration products is expected to continue as the recent wear and tear on our customers existing assets will drive equipment replacement programs commercial foodservice markets remain challenged with improved activity expected pending the successful rollout of the covid19 vaccine and the reopening of restaurant school and conference center kitchens 

refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 160 million or 134 compared to the prior year segment margin decreased to 78 from 85 in the prior year due to substantially reduced revenues and operational inefficiencies associated with covid19 increased restructuring expenses and a 36 million writeoff of assets this was partially offset by the 52 million gain on sale from the disposition of ams chino a 17 million gain on sale of assets and other broadbased cost reduction activities 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 44 compared to the prior year reflecting organic growth of 65 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 02 partially offset by a 23 impact from the disposition of ams chino the organic growth was primarily driven by large project awards for aluminum canshaping equipment resumption of key customer remodel programs as well as customer share wins in retail refrigeration and robust global demand for brazedplate heat exchangers partially offset by ongoing softness in foodservice equipment segment book to bill for the full year was 115 backlog increased 592 over the prior year principally driven by our aluminum canshaping equipment business as well as an increase in our retail refrigeration and heat exchanger businesses 

2019 versus 2018 

refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 565 million or 39 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic revenue decline of 27 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 12 the organic revenue decrease for the year ended december 31 2019 was driven principally by reduced new food retail store construction activity with key us retail refrigeration customers reduced demand for heat exchanger products in asia and softer demand from national restaurant chain customers in our foodservice equipment business these reductions were partially offset by increased project activity for canshaping equipment and strong growth in the core door case product line within food retail industry which primarily serves store remodel applications customer pricing minimally impacted revenue in 2019 

refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 173 million or 127 compared to the prior year segment margin decreased to 85 from 94 in the prior year due to reduced volumes unfavorable business mix in retail refrigeration volume ramp costs for our door case product line and costs incurred as a result of plant consolidations at our foodservice equipment business these reductions were partially offset by improved productivity and benefits from prior year rightsizing actions as well as reduced rightsizing costs 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 1595 million compared to 2019 this increase was primarily driven by improvements in working capital of 894 million payroll tax deferrals under the us cares act of 316 million and advanced payments received on contracts partially offset by lower net earnings excluding the impact of depreciation amortization loss on assets held for sale and gain on sale of a business 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 1561 million compared to 2018 this increase was driven primarily by higher continuing earnings of 1470 million excluding a loss from discontinued operations depreciation and amortization a loss on assets held for sale and a loss on extinguishment of debt 

pension and other postretirement activity total cash used in conjunction with pension plans during 2020 was 198 million including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our nonqualified supplemental pension plans 

the funded status of our us qualified defined benefit pension plan is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements due to the overfunded status of this plan the company did not make contributions in 2020 2019 or 2018 and does not expect to make contributions in the near term 

our international pension plans are located in regions where often it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2020 2019 and 2018 totaled 73 million 72 million and 60 million respectively in 2021 we expect to contribute approximately 52 million to our nonus plans 

our nonqualified supplemental pension plans are funded through company assets as benefits are paid in 2020 2019 and 2018 a total of 123 million 136 million and 194 million in benefits were paid under these plans respectively see note 18 — employee benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital we believe adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue 



adjusted working capital increased from december 31 2019 by 163 million or 15 to 11 billion at december 31 2020 which reflected a decrease in accounts receivable of 800 million an increase in inventory of 297 million and a decrease in accounts payable of 667 million these amounts include the effects of acquisitions dispositions and foreign currency translation we continue to focus on improving working capital management accounts receivable decreased compared to the prior year as a result of lower revenue as well as improved collections inventories were generally higher throughout the year as we worked to reduce levels based on lower orders and ended the year higher as compared to 2019 accounts payable however decreased at december 31 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower spend due to covid19 

we facilitate the opportunity for suppliers to participate in voluntary supply chain financing “scf” programs with participating financial institutions participating suppliers have the ability to sell receivables due from us to scf financial institutions at the discretion of both the suppliers and the scf financial institutions at no economic impact to the company the company and our suppliers agree on commercial terms including payment terms for the goods and services we procure regardless of whether the supplier participates in scf for participating suppliers our responsibility is limited to making all payments to the scf financial institutions on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier irrespective of whether the supplier elects to sell receivables to the scf financial institution the scf financial institution pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the scf financial institution  thus suppliers using scf have additional potential flexibility in managing their liquidity by accelerating at their option and cost collection of receivables due from dover 

outstanding payments related to scf programs are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2020 and 2019 amounts due to financial institutions for suppliers using scf were approximately 139 million and 126 million respectively  scf related payments are classified as a reduction to cash flows from operations amounts paid to scf financial institutions were approximately 605 million during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 and 552 million for our continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2018 

investing activities 

cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds from the sale of businesses and property plant and equipment the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

• acquisitions in 2020 we deployed 3358 million to acquire six businesses in comparison we acquired three businesses in 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2157 million total acquisition spend in 2018 was 686 million and was comprised of two businesses see note 4 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions 

• proceeds from sale of businesses in 2020 we generated cash proceeds of 154 million due to the sale of ams chino within the refrigeration  food equipment segment cash proceeds of 242 million in 2019 was due to the sale of finder in 2018 we generated cash proceeds of 39 million primarily due to cash received on a sale in 2017 

• capital spending capital expenditures primarily to support growth initiatives productivity and new product launches were 1657 million in 2020 1868 million in 2019 and 1710 million in 2018 our capital expenditures decreased 211 million in 2020 compared to 2019 in line with our reduced capital spending plan for the year as a result of covid19 without deferring strategic ongoing initiatives our capital expenditures increased 158 million in 2019 compared to 2018 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2021 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper or by accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relat es to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

• longterm debt commercial paper and notes payable net during 2020 we used 847 million to pay off commercial paper borrowings during 2019 we issued €500 million of 0750 eurodenominated notes due 2027 and 300 million of 2950 notes due 2029 the proceeds from the sale of eurodenominated notes of €4947 million net of discounts and issuance costs were used in part to redeem the €300 million 2125 notes due 2020 the proceeds from the sale of notes of 2969 million net of discounts and issuance costs and the remaining funds from the sale of the eurodenominated notes were used to fund the redemption of the 450 million 430 notes due 2021 the early extinguishment of debt resulted in a pretax loss of 235 million net borrowings decreased by 933 million due to the issuance of debt early extinguishment of debt and decrease in borrowings from commercial paper during 2018 we repaid the companys 3500 million 545 notes which matured on march 15 2018 and decreased net borrowings from commercial paper by 107 million 

• repurchase of common stock during the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 979165 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1063 million the company suspended share repurchases in the second quarter due to business uncertainty related to covid19 this temporary suspension in share repurchases was lifted during the beginning of the third quarter during the year ended december 31 2019 we repurchased 1343622 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1433 million for the year ended december 31 2018 we used 450 million to repurchase 440608 shares under our january 2015 authorization which expired on january 9 2018 under a share repurchase authorization adopted by the board of directors in february 2018 we also repurchased 1753768 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1500 million and used 700 million to repurchase a total of 8542566 shares through an accelerated share repurchase transaction which concluded in december 2018 we funded the accelerated share repurchase primarily with funds received from apergy in connection with the consummation of the apergy spinoff 

• dividend payments total dividend payments to common shareholders were 2843 million in 2020 2822 million in 2019 and 2836 million in 2018 our dividends paid per common share increased 2 to 197 per share in 2020 compared to 194 per share in 2019 which represents the 65th consecutive year that our dividend per share has increased the number of common shares outstanding decreased from 2019 to 2020 due to our share repurchase programs 

• net proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards payments to settle tax obligations on share exercises were 285 million 374 million and 463 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the decreases each year is primarily due to the decrease in the number of shares exercised partially offset by an increase in the average stock price compared to the prior year period 

• cash received from apergy net of cash distributed  in connection with the separation of apergy from dover on may 9 2018 apergy incurred borrowings to fund a onetime cash payment of 7000 million to dover in connection with dovers contribution to apergy of stock and assets relating to the businesses spun off with apergy dover received net cash of 6896 million upon separation which reflects 104 million of cash held by apergy at the time of distribution and retained by it in connection with its separation from dover 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

there were no cash flows from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 our cash flows from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2018 used 143 million these cash flows primarily reflect the operating results of apergy prior to its separation during the second quarter of 2018 cash flows used in discontinued 

operations for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily reflects cash payments of spinoff costs of 464 million and capital expenditures of 237 million partially offset by cash provided by operations of approximately 554 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that may be available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions paying dividends repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2020 we generated free cash flow of 9391 million representing 141 of revenue and 1374 of earnings from continuing operations free cash flow in 2019 was 7585 million or 106 of revenue and 1119 of earnings from continuing operations free cash flow in 2018 was 6182 million or 88 of revenue and 1046 of earnings from continuing operations the full year increase in 2020 free cash flow reflects higher cash flow provided by operations primarily due to improvements in working capital permitted deferrals of tax payments and advanced payments received on contracts as previously noted as well as lower capital expenditures the 2019 increase in free cash flow compared to 2018 is due to higher operating earnings partially offset by higher capital expenditures 

  

capitalization 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock as of december 31 2020 we maintained a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks which will expire on october 4 2024 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program 

beginning in earlytomidmarch 2020 the commercial paper market began to experience very high levels of volatility as a result of covid19 related uncertainties volatility was most pronounced for tier2 issuers such as dover and impacted both market access and pricing as a result on march 16 2020 the company borrowed 500 million under the credit agreement proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay all of the companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes we subsequently repaid the 500 million in the second quarter using proceeds from commercial paper as volatility in the commercial paper market stabilized and we resumed borrowing commercial paper 

the company may elect to have loans under the credit agreement which bear interest at a base rate plus a specified applicable margin under this facility we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2020 and had a coverage ratio of 114 to 1 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

on may 6 2020 we entered into a 4500 million 364day revolving credit facility the shortterm credit agreement with a syndicate of banks to be used primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes effective november 12 2020 we terminated the aggregate commitments under the shortterm credit agreement we did not undertake any borrowings under this facility prior to termination 

on november 4 2019 we issued €500 million of 0750 eurodenominated notes due 2027 and 300 million of 2950 notes due 2029 on december 4 2019 proceeds from the aforementioned notes were used to redeem the €300 million 2125 notes due 2020 and the 450 million 430 notes due 2021 such redemption payments were made on december 4 2019 which required us to pay a make whole premium to the bondholders resulting in a loss of 235 million the remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

on march 15 2018 the outstanding 545 notes with a principal value of 350000 matured the repayment of debt was funded in part by borrowings under our commercial paper program and with existing cash balances 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 5131 million of which approximately 3459 million was held outside the united states at december 31 2019 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3973 million of which 2731 million was held outside the united states cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks we regularly hold cash in excess of nearterm requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders equity the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 434 at december 31 2020 compared to 468 at december 31 2019 the decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by the increase in stockholders equity of 3531 million for the period as a result of increase in current earnings of 6835 million offset by 2843 million of dividends paid and 1063 million in share repurchases net debt decreased 774 million during the period primarily due to an increase of 1158 million in cash and cash equivalents and a reduction in commercial paper partially offset by an increase in longterm debt as a result of foreign currency translation on our eurodenominated notes 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 468 at december 31 2019 compared to 500 at december 31 2018 the decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by the increase in stockholders equity of 2640 million for the period as a result of increase in current earnings of 6779 million offset by 1433 million in share repurchases and 2822 million of 

dividends paid net debt decreased 946 million during the period primarily due to a reduction in commercial paper partially offset by a net increase in longterm debt after debt issuances and redemptions in 2019 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash flowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing set forth below are our credit ratings as of december 31 2020 which were independently developed by the respective credit agencies the moodys rating and outlook were issued in december 2018 and the standard  poors rating was issued in december 2017 and the outlook was revised in may 2020 



operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 1525 million outstanding in letters of credit surety bonds and performance and other guarantees with financial institutions which expire on various dates through 2029 these letters of credit and bonds are primarily issued as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

as of december 31 2020 and during the three year period then ended we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts however we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixed in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2020 yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2807 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries including canada substantially all of the european countries mexico brazil china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges 

additionally we have designated the €600 million and €500 million of eurodenominated notes issued november 9 2016 and november 4 2019 respectively as a hedge of our net investment in eurodenominated operations we had also designated the €300 million notes due in 2020 as a net investment hedge prior to our redemption of the notes due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the us dollar the us dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases resulting in the recognition of a pretax loss gain of 1193 million 224 million and 452 million in other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

commodity price exposure 

some of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations of accounting principles that affect the amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect supplemental information contained in our disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to us gaap and is consistently applied we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition  effective january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standard codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers under asc topic 606 a contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved that creates enforceable rights and obligations has commercial substance and where payment terms are identified and collectability is probable once we enter a contract it is evaluated to identify performance obligations for each performance obligation revenue is recognized as control of promised goods or services transfers to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services the amount of revenue recognized takes into account variable consideration such as discounts and volume rebates the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components with revenue 

recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we include shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of goods and services see note 3 — revenue for further details 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or net realizable value an immaterial portion of domestic inventories are stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates in addition the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist when some portion but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of or classified as assets held for sale or when a change in the composition of reporting units occurs for other reasons such as a change in segments 

when performing an impairment test we estimate fair value using the incomebased valuation method under the incomebased valuation method fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rate based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from these estimates the discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates we use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2020 reporting unit valuations ranged from 80 to 90 

we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for each of our 15 reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2020 concluding that the fair values of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying values as such no goodwill impairment was recognized while we believe the assumptions used in the 2020 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results and reflective of a market participant actual results may differ from expectations 

employee benefit plans  the valuation of our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates annually we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual and forecasted returns economic trends and and portfolio allocation our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams the plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting yearbyyear spot rates as disclosed in note 18 — employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements the 2020 weightedaverage discount rate used to measure our qualified defined benefit obligations ranged from 079 to 265 a general decrease from the 2019 rates which ranged from 118 to 340 the lower 2020 discount rates in the us are reflective of decreased market interest rates over this period a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the postretirement benefit obligations by approximately 355 million from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2020 our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately 17 million 

income taxes  we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies reserves are also estimated using more likely than not criteria for federal state and nonus tax issues we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves reserves 

related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings as further described below with respect to us tax law changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

risk retention insurance  we have significant accruals and reserves related to the selfretained portion of our risk management program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions our experience and relevant industry data we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 

contingencies  we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues while we believe that the amount accrued todate is adequate future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 

restructuring  we establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management or when termination benefits are communicated exit costs may include contractual terminations and asset impairments as a result of an approved restructuring plan the accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

disposed and discontinued operations  from time to time we sell or discontinue or dispose of certain operations for various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similartype entities the adjustments to fair value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates as noted previously in 2019 we recorded an impairment on assets held for sale due to the sale of finder in 2020 and 2018 no impairment charges were recorded due to operations sold discontinued or disposed 

stockbased compensation  we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock units and performance share awards we use the blackscholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars granted to employees the performance share awards granted in 2020 are market condition awards and we determined the fair value using the monte carlo simulation model a binomial latticebased valuation model for information related to the assumptions used see note 16 — equity and cash incentive program to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

recent accounting standards 

see note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow free cash flow as a percentage of revenue free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations net debt net capitalization net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital organic revenue growth and rightsizing costs are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings cash flows from operating activities debt or equity working capital revenue or restructuring costs as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings which is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level segment ebitda margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio free cash flow and free cash flow ratios are important measures of liquidity net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow and free cash flow ratios provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations equals free cash flow divided by earnings from continuing operations we believe that reporting adjusted working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods we believe that reporting rightsizing costs which include restructuring and other charges is important as it enables management and investors to better understand the financial impact of our broadbased cost reduction footprint consolidation it centralization and operational improvement initiatives

characteristics of a dover business 

our businesses have consistently enjoyed a loyal customer base that chooses products primarily based on performance in many instances our businesses produce critical equipment or components to a larger system where valueinuse and costs and risks of switching far exceed the cost of the product itself our products tend to have meaningful replacement consumable or aftermarket demand due in part to a large installed base with loyal customers because they play a specialized role in customer applications recurring demand which includes parts consumables services and software represents approximately 30 of our revenue our businesses increasingly complement our component or equipment offerings with digital solutions such as connected products sensors and software that create new sources of value to our customers and allow dover businesses to drive growth and increase relevance with our customers our focus in shaping dovers portfolio is aimed at building an enterprise with a large and stable cash flow low capital intensity and sustainable returns on invested capital well in excess of our cost of capital 

business strategy 

to achieve our stated goals we are focused on executing the following pillars of dover’s business strategy 

capturing growth potential in our endmarkets and adjacencies 

dover’s five business segments are focused on building enduring competitive advantages and leadership positions in markets that we believe are positioned for sustained future growth we believe that our businesses are among the top suppliers in most markets and niches that we serve as defined by customer applications geographies or products which positions us well to capture future growth we capitalize on our engineering technology and design expertise and maintain an intense focus on meeting the needs of our customers and adding significant and often new value to their operations through superior product performance safety and reliability and a commitment to aftermarket support we cultivate and maintain an entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve 

in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on growing industrial manufacturing and trade volumes adoption of digital technologies increasing requirements for sustainability safety energy efficiency and consumer product safety and growth of the middle class and consumption in emerging economies our engineered products segment is capitalizing on secular growth in waste generation and increasing sophistication and automation of waste collection operations increasing car parc car age and miles driven as well as increasing digitization and sensorization of modern vehicles our fueling solutions segment benefits from worldwide growth in safety and compliance regulations new infrastructure buildout in emerging economies increased sophistication and digitization of convenience and fuel retailing as well as a secular growth in automated vehicle wash systems over manual and doityourself washing our imaging  identification segment leverages its unique product offering containing equipment consumables software and services to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing increased demand for product traceability and brand protection and consumer product safety our pumps  process solutions segment is focused on capturing growth in its installed base and growing sophistication of fluid transfer and rotating machinery components within the chemical plastics and polymer industrial mid and downstream oil  gas biopharma and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support our refrigeration  food equipment segment is responding to our customers’ demand for increased energy efficiency and sustainability in food retail merchandising solutions as well as increasing demand for sustainable heating and cooling solutions and growing global demand for aluminum beverage cans 

we aim to grow by making organic investments in research and development developing new products and technologies improving digital capabilities expanding our geographic coverage and by pursuing disciplined strategic acquisitions that will enhance our portfolio and position dover for longterm growth we continually evaluate how our assets and capabilities can position dover to grow in markets adjacent to our core businesses for example new applications geographies product segments or adjacent technologies where dover can be advantaged 

in addition to product innovation we plan to grow by developing digital technologies in 2018 we opened our new digital labs center in the greater boston area and have continued to invest in this facility and our team of software developers data scientists and product managers to enhance our digital capability the digital labs team is driving digital transformation across our businesses along the following three areas i ecommerce – more efficient and streamlined digital customer interfaces that make it easy to do business with dover companies ii connected products – development of valueadd connected sensorized and softwareaugmented solutions built on top of dover’s core equipment and component offerings in our endmarkets and iii digital manufacturing – driving increased efficiency safety and quality in our manufacturing operations by employing cuttingedge automation and “digital factory” solutions we believe that the digital labs center will enhance the effectiveness of our products and fuel our commercial growth strategy by leveraging a central resource for industrial internet of things iiot and connected product initiatives we are able to reduce redundancy of support infrastructure while managing the proliferation of common parts such as sensors to keep our projects costcompetitive 

improving profitability and return on invested capital 

we are committed to generating sustainable returns on invested capital well above the cost of capital across all of our businesses we continually evaluate and pursue opportunities to improve efficiency margin and return on capital we are intensely foc used on driving operational excellence across our businesses over several years we have implemented numerous productivity initiatives such as supply chain integration management shared service centers and lean manufacturing principles to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees our businesses place a strong emphasis on continual product quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and to facilitate expansion into new products and geographic markets further we continue to make significant investments in talent development especially in the area of operational management and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success 

in 2018 we launched our margin expansion program designed to reduce our selling general and administrative cost base and rationalize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint across the portfolio in 2019 we continued to expand initiatives to extract productivity gains across the businesses and initiated a set of productivity actions to realize further savings in 2020 current margin expansion initiatives are focused on the further centralization of shared services under dover business services improving utilization and optimization of our manufacturing footprint as well as our it services and costs and continuing to leverage our digital labs team to improve our ecommerce capabilities 

we have invested and will continue to invest in dover business services shared service centers to provide important transactional and valueadded services to our operating companies in the areas of finance it and human resources our shared service model allows us to leverage scale across dover increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls our shared service centers serve our operating companies by freeing resources normally dedicated to transactional services to allow those resources to focus on customers markets and product excellence we expect to continue driving efficiencies through dover business services as we increase the level of service centralization across the portfolio 

digital labs consists of a team of approximately 100 software developers data scientists and product managers who provide digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience develop connected products and drive automation and efficiency our dover digital leadership has begun deploying customer facing applications of common infrastructure design to make it easier to find experience and buy products from dover the digital labs team has also deployed shared iiot capability so many of dovers products are remotely configurable and monitored enabling our businesses to sell aftermarket parts and offer remote diagnostic services 

in 2019 we launched a set of initiatives to improve operational efficiency and enhance and solidify the continuous improvement programs embedded in our businesses daytoday operations beginning with several significant production automation and footprint consolidation projects with the launch of the new segment structure and continued evolution of dover’s operating model we will now oversee operations management from the corporate center we expect this team to work closely with our businesses to drive execution excellence in our operational initiatives and bestinclass processes standards and measurement tools to identify prioritize and monitor execution of operational improvement initiatives 

additionally we focus on improving margins and returns by rigorously capturing synergies from our acquisitions and providing bestinclass corporate support and services through a lean corporate center 

disciplined capital allocation 

we are focused on the most efficient allocation of capital to maximize returns on investment to do this we prioritize organic reinvestment to grow and strengthen our existing businesses we plan to make average annual investments in capital spending of approximately 2  4 of revenue with a focus on internal projects designed to expand our market participation develop new products and improve productivity we also seek to deploy capital in acquisitions in attractive growth areas across our five segments dover focuses primarily on bolton acquisitions applying strict selection criteria of market attractiveness including growth maturity and performancebased competition business fit including sustained leading position revenue visibility and favorable customer valueadd versus switching cost or risk and financial return profile accretive growth and margins and doubledigit return on capital finally we have consistently returned cash to shareholders 

by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 64 years we also undertake opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy and completed 1 billion of share repurchases towards the end of 2017 and in 2018 primarily with funds received from apergy in connection to the spinoff and 1433 million in 2019 we employ a prudent financial policy to support our capital allocation strategy which includes maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

portfolio development 

acquisitions 

our acquisition program has two key elements as a first priority we seek to acquire attractive addon businesses with a strong fit that enhance our existing franchises either by increasing their reach and customer access by broadening their product mix or by enhancing technological capability and customer valueadd second in the right circumstances we may strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that complement our existing businesses or provide a path for us to pursue growth in near adjacencies with all our acquisitions we seek businesses that are leaders in their markets or niches have a strong track record for innovation offer differentiated solutions clearly complement our businesses and have a solid organic growth profile attractive and sustainable returns and offer significant synergy potential to generate doubledigit return on capital within three years after the acquisition is completed 

over the past three years 2017 through 2019 we have spent approximately 3193 million to purchase seven businesses during 2019 we acquired three businesses for an aggregate consideration of 2164 million net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration consistent with our acquisition program we acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the fueling solutions and pumps  process solutions segments during 2018 we acquired two businesses for an aggregate consideration of 686 million net of cash acquired we acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the pumps  process solutions and refrigeration  food equipment segments during 2017 we acquired two businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 343 million net of cash acquired within the imaging  identification segment for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past three years see note 4 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses that expand the scope of our offerings and make us an even more important supplier to our customers while we expect to generate annual organic revenue growth of 3  5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary adverse economic conditions our success in consistently growing the portfolio is also dependent on the ability to acquire and integrate businesses successfully within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal scorecard and welldefined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created 

dispositions 

we have sold or divested some of our businesses based on changes in specific market outlook structural changes in financial performance valuecreation potential or for other strategic considerations which included an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets or focus on our higher margin growth spaces most of our efforts to streamline and improve the portfolio to less cyclical and higher growth businesses were completed in 2018 with the apergy spinoff 

going forward we also recognize that some businesses in dover’s portfolio may have a greater valuecreation potential if owned by another parent with a larger presence and focus on a given niche we pragmatically consider such opportunities as part of our ongoing portfolio management and review processes and execute divestitures if the value created is determined to be at an appropriate premium to the value of such business to dover and allows dover shareholders to participate in the future valuecreation potential from a change in ownership 

during the past three years 2017 through 2019 we have sold businesses for aggregate cash consideration of 4008 million during 2019 we completed the sale of finder pompe srl finder within the pumps  process solutions segment during 2018 there were no other material dispositions aside from the spinoff of apergy as previously discussed the financial position and results of operations for apergy have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented during 2017 we completed the sale of performance motorsports international pmi and the consumer and industrial winch business of warn industries warn as well as other smaller divestitures the disposals in 2019 and 2017

our imaging  identification segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation and performance and total cost of ownership improvement the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the imaging  identification segment 

our businesses pursue digital strategies based on customer needs and will now be able to leverage crosscompany capabilities developed at the digital labs center for example with the support of the digital labs center hydro which manufacturers chemical injecting proportioning dispensing and medicating equipment within our pumps  process solutions segment launched hydro connect in 2018 hydro connect is a cloudbased iiot platform that gives end users increased visibility into their operations optimizes production reduces costs and increases customer satisfaction building on this momentum we launched a digital initiative in 2018 to help our businesses increase sales and further improve customer satisfaction through digital technology starting with dover food retail within our refrigeration  food equipment segment 

in 2019 our businesses continued to expand utilization of the digital labs center our vehicle services group within the engineered products segment launched mosiac advanced diagnostic technology the industry’s firstever automated advanced driverassistance system and calibration system through a partnership with burke porter group and the capability developed at the digital labs additionally as a part of the digital customer initiative colder a business in the pumps  process solutions segment and opw a business in the fueling solutions segment launched business to business digital engagement platforms that enable their customers to place track and repeat orders 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers none of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2019 given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are not significant businesses supplying the environmental solutions defense automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

seasonality 

in general while our businesses are not highly seasonal we do tend to have stronger revenue generation in the second half of the year which is driven by customer capital expenditure timing and seasonal activity patterns in our endmarkets our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase in the second half of the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends which moderates the aforementioned seasonality patterns our food retail refrigeration business tends to face higher levels of demand in the second and third quarters as retailers avoid construction and remodeling activity during fallwinter holidays 

backlog 

backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm contracts primarily for the businesses serving solid waste handling plastics and polymers processing bearings and compressor components canshaping equipment and commercial refrigeration markets see segment results of operations within item 7 for further discussion of this operational measure our total backlog relating to our businesses as of december 31 2019 and 2018 was 15 billion and 14 billion respectively 

competition 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation a summary of our key competitors within each of our segments follows 



international 

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we aim to increase our revenue in international markets particularly in developing economies in asia the middle east eastern europe and south america 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in china france germany italy sweden switzerland the united kingdom and other locations including australia brazil canada india mexico and the netherlands 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 19 — segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

sustainability 

we are committed to creating economic value for shareholders by developing products designed to help our customers meet their sustainability goals in response to evolving regulatory and environmental standards we believe that sustainabilitydriven innovation in response to customer demand will present a growth opportunity while contributing positively to enhanced resource efficiency and reduced waste in that regard our businesses have accelerated efforts and processes around innovation including by focusing on technologies that create tangible value for our customers for example in our engineered products segment we manufacture onsite waste balers and compactors for customers who need to quickly and efficiently process solid waste and recyclables in our imaging  identification segment we offer packaging intelligence solutions that enable efficient product tracking and identification as well as improved line efficiency minimized waste and improved compliance for our customers our fueling solutions segment offers products that support the delivery of alternative fuels help reduce vehicle emissions and assist in vapor recovery through our pumps and solutions segment we focus on the conversion to sustainable and renewable energy usage in heating and cooling applications we have developed innovative retail refrigeration technologies in our refrigeration  food equipment segment that are both energy efficient and cost effective 

we are also committed to fostering sustainable business practices across our businesses in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption we believe that our focus on sustainability will result in enhanced efficiency in our operations which will reduce costs improve margins and help us achieve operational excellence in 2010 we implemented a process to conduct an inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities as well as developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes goals objectives and related projects for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions to further promote our sustainability efforts we committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we have achieved those goals ahead of schedule we are currently evaluating our strategic approach to managing sustainability matters and plan to continue reporting on our energy and greenhouse gas intensity and to work proactively to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions amidst acquisition and business growth we have participated as a voluntary respondent in the carbon disclosure project cdp since 2010 and have maintained our scoring range since we began reporting we began participating in the cdp water security program in 2018 and expanded our reporting in 2019 with water data collection 

as noted our businesses assess the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the opportunities associated with the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

other matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory 

impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in pass through costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees 

we had approximately 24000 employees as of december 31 2019 

other information 

we make available free of charge through the investor information link on our website wwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our website is not incorporated into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

• our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition cash flows and cost of capital 

• we are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets 

approximately 47 and 48 of our revenues for 2019 and 2018 respectively were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on crossborder transactions and the translation of local currency results into us dollars could negatively impact our results of operations 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows which are presented in us dollars crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro chinese renminbi yuan swedish krona pound sterling indian rupee singapore dollar danish krone and canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

• increasing productservice and price competition by international and domestic competitors including new entrants and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences evolving regulations new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

• our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation 

the success of new and improved products digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand which may result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences to deliver high quality innovative and competitive products to the market to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to thirdparty technologies and to stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new products digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

• tariffs have resulted in increased prices and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

over the last several years tariffs under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 have been imposed on certain steel and aluminum products imported into the us which have increased the prices of these inputs increased prices for imported steel and aluminum products have led domestic sellers to respond with marketbased increases to prices for such inputs as well tariffs under section 301 of the trade expansion act were also imposed on goods imported from china in connection with chinas intellectual property practices which may increase the cost to our customers of our products manufactured in china as well as the cost of chinese sourced parts and components for our products manufactured in the us china also has imposed tariffs on some us goods that we manufacture and sell into china 

an additional round of tariffs may be imposed on goods imported from china if ongoing trade negotiations between the us and china are not successful the existing tariffs along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the us or other countries could result in further increased prices and a decreased available supply of steel and aluminum as well as additional costs on imported components and inputs we may not be able to pass price increases on to our customers and may not be able to secure adequate alternative sources on a timely basis while retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods have not yet had a significant impact we cannot predict further developments the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of our businesses and customer demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes risks associated with emerging markets changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws regulations and policies including environmental employment and health and safety regulations data security laws data privacy laws exportimport laws tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits carbon emission regulations and energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs these laws regulations and policies are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates in addition the brexit withdrawal agreement and subsequent negotiations as to goforward terms and conditions between the united kingdom and the european union may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations although it is unknown what the full terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union will be following the transition period in 2020 it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and other countries and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial position 

certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance or economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

  

• we could lose customers or generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which exposes us to pricing and supply risks significant price increases for certain commodities other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors 

we use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers around the world while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally 

adequate it is difficult to predict what effects shortages may have in the future in addition some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers if a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms including at favorable prices in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or a shortage in or the unavailability of raw materials or components may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations for example we recorded rightsizing costs in 2018 comprised of restructuring expense of 585 million and other costs of 143 million and rightsizing costs in 2019 comprised of restructuring expense of 268 million and other costs of 53 million primarily related to actions taken on employee reductions facility consolidations and site closures product line exits and other associated asset charges these rightsizing activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses may reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements and unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize through our various programs any of the circumstances described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our operations businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks 

we depend on our own and third party it systems including cloudbased systems and managed service providers to store process and protect our information and support our business activities we also use our third party it systems to support employee data processing for our global work force and to support customer business activities such as transmitting payment information providing mobile monitoring services and capturing operational data additionally some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks if these technologies systems products or services are damaged cease to function properly are compromised due to employee error user error malfeasance system errors or other vulnerabilities or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving denial of service attacks unauthorized access malicious software or other intrusions including by criminals nation states or insiders our business may be adversely impacted the impacts could include production downtimes operational delays and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers compromise of confidential proprietary or otherwise protected information including personal information and customer confidential data destruction corruption or theft of data manipulation disruption or improper use of these technologies systems products or services financial losses from fraudulent transactions remedial actions loss of business or potential liability adverse media coverage and legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions and damage to our reputation there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting 

confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers by both statesponsored and criminal organizations moreover there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds 

these trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks it is possible for vulnerabilities in our it systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training systems monitoring and other technical security controls a breach response plan maintenance of backup and protective systems and security personnel our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows we and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks including phishing and denialofservice attacks and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption in addition a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it and actions decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business results of operations and reputation while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise as cyber threats continue to evolve cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the us and globally and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more internetenabled products and offerings we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs strengthen our information security data protection and business continuity measures and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities 

• unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances or claims related to patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects to cause property damage to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures which would reduce operating profit and cash flow in addition a product recall may require significant management attention product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• if the apergy spinoff together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with the spinoff of apergy we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs ruling together with an opinion of mcdermott will  emery llp our tax counsel substantially to the effect that among other things certain transactions to effect the spinoff will qualify as a taxfree reorganization for us federal income tax purposes under section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” and the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution to our shareholders under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and apergy 

including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion in addition we and apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment we would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if we had sold the apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the apergy common stock received in the distribution in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law we could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law respectively 

• the indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters 

in connection with the spinoff apergy agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the apergy business there can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations the failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

• our reputation ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate united states andor nonunited states laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

• our revenue operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights our businesses employ various measures to develop maintain and protect their intellectual property rights these measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of our businesses intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• if we experience work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we have a number of collective bargaining units in the united states and various foreign collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity reputation consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows

nonoperating items 

interest expense net 

for the year ended december 31 2019 interest expense net of interest income decreased 08 million or 07 to 1213 million compared with 2018 primarily due to the 350 million 545 10year notes that were paid in march 2018 that resulted in lower outstanding longterm debt and lower interest expense compared to 2018 partially offset by lower interest income

gain on sale of businesses 

there were no dispositions in the year 2019 aside from the sale of finder as described above and no significant dispositions in 2018 aside from the spinoff of apergy whose results are presented as discontinued operations 

for the year ended december 31 2017 gain on sale of businesses was 2031 million the gain was primarily due to the sales of pmi and the consumer and industrial winch business of warn both within the engineered products segment in which we recognized gains on sale of 884 million and 1169 million respectively other immaterial dispositions completed during the year were recorded as a net loss of 22 million the disposals in 2017 did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations 

income taxes 

our businesses have a global presence with 468 525 and 378 of our pretax earnings in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively generated in foreign jurisdictions foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that differ from the 210 us statutory tax rate as a result of our nonus business locations our effective foreign tax rate is typically lower than the us statutory tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 196 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 185 for the year ended december 31 2018 the 2019 and 2018 rates were impacted by 266 million and 240 million respectively of favorable net discrete items primarily driven by the tax benefit of share award exercises 

on december 22 2017 the us bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform act” was enacted which reduced the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate effective january 1 2018 as a result of the reduction in the us corporate income tax rate we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2017 and recognized a provisional tax benefit of 1720 million the tax reform act also imposed a tax for a onetime deemed repatriation of post1986 unremitted foreign earnings and profits through the year ended december 31 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded provisional tax expense related to the deemed repatriation of 1116 million payable over eight years 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant did not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act in accordance with the sab 118 guidance we recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 in accordance with sab 118 we finalized the financial reporting impact of the tax reform act in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded a 42 million net tax benefit which resulted in a 06 decrease in the effective tax rate as an adjustment to provisional estimates as a result of additional regulatory guidance and changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made as a result of the tax reform act 

for the year ended december 31 2017 our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 147 the effective tax rate was impacted by favorable net discrete items totaling 517 million principally related to the impact recorded for the us tax reform act 

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to 153 million we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

earnings from continuing operations 

for the year ended december 31 2019 earnings from continuing operations increased 868 million or 147 to 6779 million or 461 per share compared with earnings from continuing operations of 5911 million or 389 per share for the year ended december 31 2018 earnings increased due to organic volume growth pricing actions and productivity initiatives including the benefits of restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives additionally aftertax rightsizing costs were lower by 329 million in 2019 compared to 2018 these benefits more than offset increases in material costs due in part to us section 232 and 301 tariff exposure as well as a loss due to the aftertax extinguishment of debt of 184 million and a loss on assets held for sale of 469 million diluted earnings per share also improved due to the benefit of the prior and current year share repurchases 

for the year ended december 31 2018 earnings from continuing operations decreased 1555 million or 208 to 5911 million or 389 per share compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7467 million or 473 per share for the year ended december 31 2017 earnings decreased primarily because we did not record any gains from dispositions in 2018 compared to 2017 when we recorded net aftertax gains from dispositions of 1726 million in 2018 we recorded a net tax benefit primarily from the tax reform act of 42 million whereas in 2017 we recorded a net tax benefit of 549 million additionally aftertax rightsizing costs were higher by 237 million in 2018 compared to 2017 excluding these items earnings from continuing operations increased in 2018 as a result of higher earnings due to increased sales volumes diluted earnings per share also improved due to the benefit of the share repurchase programs announced in november 2017

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energyefficient equipment and systems that serve the commercial refrigeration heating and cooling and food equipment markets 



2019 versus 2018 

refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 565 million or 39 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic revenue decline of 27 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 12 the organic revenue decrease for the year ended december 31 2019 was driven principally by reduced new food retail store construction activity with key us retail refrigeration customers reduced demand for heat exchanger products in asia and softer demand from national restaurant chain customers in our foodservice equipment business these reductions were partially offset by increased project activity for canshaping equipment and strong growth in the core door case product line within food retail industry which primarily serves store remodel applications customer pricing minimally impacted revenue in 2019 

refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 173 million or 127 compared to the prior year segment margin decreased to 85 from 94 in the prior year due to reduced volumes unfavorable business mix in retail refrigeration volume ramp costs for our door case product line and costs incurred as a result of plant consolidations at our foodservice equipment business these reductions were partially offset by improved productivity and benefits from prior year rightsizing actions as well as reduced rightsizing costs 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 19 compared to the prior year primarily driven by reduced demand in our us retail refrigeration and foodservice equipment businesses partially offset by increased market demand for aluminum canshaping equipment driven by beverage companies shifting from plastic to aluminum containers bookings decreased 07 organically and decreased 12 due to foreign currency translation ending backlog was 192 higher than 

prior year driven by fourth quarter bookings growth in our retail refrigeration and canshaping equipment businesses  book to bill for the full year was 104

refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased 1460 million or 91 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic revenue decline of 79 the impact from product line dispositions of 26 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 07 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 07 customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 08 in 2018 refrigeration  food equipment organic revenue declined principally due to weak capital spending and deferred remodel programs by key us retail refrigeration customers as well as a product redesign and sku rationalization program in our refrigeration door system product line additionally the foodservice equipment and canshaping businesses also had year over year shortfalls due to project timing and market softness these were partially offset by increased demand for heat exchanger products most notably in europe and by the addition of sales from our rosario acquisition 

refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased 577 million or 298 compared to the prior year segment margin decreased to 94 from 121 in the prior year as benefits from rightsizing actions productivity gains and lower rightsizing costs were more than offset by volume reductions unfavorable product mix in our canshaping business costs associated with product redesign and sku rationalization in our refrigeration door system product line and a favorable 17 million disposition gain in 2017 due to a working capital adjustment segment margin was also impacted by rising material costs most notably steel inclusive of commodity pricing impacts attributable to us section 232 tariffs 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 1561 million compared to 2018 this increase was driven primarily by higher continuing earnings of 1470 million excluding a loss from discontinued operations depreciation and amortization a loss on assets held for sale and a loss on extinguishment of debt 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 498 million compared to 2017 this increase was primarily driven by higher continuing earnings of 469 million excluding noncash activity from depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of businesses and significantly lower tax payments in 2018 due to a lower tax rate as well as tax payments made in 2017 for dispositions the increase was offset by higher investments in working capital relative to the prior year in support of organic bookings and timing of year end revenue 

pension and other postretirement activity total cash used in conjunction with pension plans during 2019 was 214 million including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our nonqualified supplemental pension plan 

the funded status of our us qualified defined benefit pension plan is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements due to the overfunded status of this plan the company did not make contributions in 2019 2018 or 2017 and does not expect to make contributions in the near term 

our international pension plans are located in regions where often it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2019 2018 and 2017 totaled 72 million 60 million and 80 million respectively in 2020 we expect to contribute approximately 46 million to our nonus plans 

our nonqualified supplemental pension plans are funded through company assets as benefits are paid in 2019 2018 and 2017 a total of 136 million 194 million and 116 million in benefits were paid under these plans respectively see note 17 — employee benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital we believe adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue 



adjusted working capital increased from december 31 2018 by 289 million or 29 to 104 billion at december 31 2019 which reflected a decrease in accounts receivable of 147 million an increase in inventory of 573 million and an increase in accounts payable of 138 million we continue to focus on improving working capital management by reducing our accounts receivable balance and increasing our accounts payable balance at december 31 2019 compared to the prior year however inventories increased at december 31 2019 compared to 2018 given planned footprint moves and a higher backlog going into 2020 

investing activities 

cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash inflows from proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments offset by cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

• acquisitions in 2019 we deployed 2157 million to acquire three businesses in comparison we acquired two businesses in 2018 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 686 million total acquisition spend in 2017 was 272 million and was comprised of two businesses see note 4 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions 

• proceeds from sale of businesses in 2019 we generated cash proceeds of 242 million due to the sale of finder cash proceeds of 39 million in 2018 was primarily due to cash received on a sale in 2017 in 2017 we generated cash proceeds of 3727 million primarily from the sale of pmi and warn 

• capital spending capital expenditures primarily to support growth initiatives productivity and new product launches were 1868 million in 2019 1710 million in 2018 and 1701 million in 2017 our capital expenditures increased 158 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and remained relatively flat in 2018 compared to 2017 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2020 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper or by accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

• longterm debt commercial paper and notes payable net during 2019 we issued €500 million of 0750 eurodenominated notes due 2027 and 300 million of 2950 notes due 2029 the proceeds from the sale of eurodenominated notes of €4947 million net of discounts and issuance costs were used in part to redeem the €300 million 2125 notes due 2020 the proceeds from the sale of notes of 2969 million net of discounts and issuance costs and the remaining funds from the sale of the eurodenominated notes were used to fund the redemption of the 450 million 430 notes due 2021 the early extinguishment of debt resulted in a pretax loss of 235 million net borrowings decreased by 933 million due to the issuance of debt early extinguishment of debt and decrease in borrowings from commercial paper 

during 2018 we repaid the companys 3500 million 545 notes which matured on march 15 2018 and decreased net borrowings from commercial paper by 107 million during 2017 we decreased net borrowings from commercial paper by 1826 million with the cash proceeds from the sale of pmi and warn 

• cash received from apergy net of cash distributed  in connection with the separation of apergy from dover on may 9 2018 apergy incurred borrowings to fund a onetime cash payment of 7000 million to dover in connection with dovers contribution to apergy of stock and assets relating to the businesses spun off with apergy dover received net cash of 6896 million upon separation which reflects 104 million of cash held by apergy at the time of distribution and retained by it in connection with its separation from dover 

• repurchase of common stock during the year ended december 31 2019 we repurchased 1343622 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1433 million for the year ended december 31 2018 we used 450 million to repurchase 440608 shares under our january 2015 authorization which expired on january 9 2018 under a share repurchase authorization adopted by the board of directors in february 2018 we also repurchased 1753768 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1500 million and used 700 million to repurchase a total of 8542566 shares through an accelerated share repurchase transaction which concluded in december 2018 we funded the accelerated share repurchase primarily with funds received from apergy in connection with the consummation of the apergy spinoff for the year ended december 31 2017 we used 1050 million to repurchase 1059682 shares under the january 2015 authorization 

• dividend payments total dividend payments to common shareholders were 2822 million in 2019 2836 million in 2018 and 2840 million in 2017 our dividends paid per common share increased 2 to 194 per share in 2019 compared to 190 per share in 2018 which represents the 64th consecutive year that our dividend has increased the number of common shares outstanding decreased from 2018 to 2019 due to our share repurchase programs 

• net proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards payments to settle tax obligations on share exercises were 374 million 463 million and 184 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively these tax payments generally increase or decrease correspondingly to the number of exercises in a particular year 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

there were no cash flows from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2019 our cash flows from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 used generated 143 million and 485 million respectively these cash flows primarily reflect the operating results of apergy prior to its separation during the second quarter of 2018 cash flows used in discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily reflects cash payments of spinoff costs of 464 million and capital expenditures of 237 million partially offset by cash provided by operations of approximately 554 million cash flows generated for the years ended december 31 2017 primarily reflects cash provided by operating activities of approximately 962 million respectively partially offset by capital expenditures 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that may be available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions paying dividends repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2019 we generated free cash flow of 7585 million representing 106 of revenue and 1119 of earnings from continuing operations free cash flow in 2018 was 6182 million or 88 of revenue and 1046 of earnings from continuing operations free cash flow in 2017 was 5693 million or 83 of revenue and 763 of earnings from continuing operations the full year increase in 2019 free cash flow reflects higher cash flow provided by operations due to higher operating earnings as previously mentioned partially offset by higher capital expenditures the 2018 increase in free cash flow compared to 2017 is due to higher operating earnings cash payments related to restructuring initiatives were 333 million 520 million and 226 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

capitalization 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock on october 4 2019 we entered into a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the “credit agreement” that replaced a similar existing credit facility that was set to expire in november 2020 the credit agreement will expire on october 4 2024 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin under this facility we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2019 and had a coverage ratio of 106 to 1 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

on march 15 2018 the outstanding 545 notes with a principal value of 350000 matured the repayment of debt was funded in part by borrowings under our commercial paper program and with existing cash balances 

on november 4 2019 we issued €500 million of 0750 eurodenominated notes due 2027 and 300 million of 2950 notes due 2029 the proceeds from the sale of eurodenominated notes of €4947 million net of discounts and issuance costs were used in part to redeem the €300 million 2125 notes due 2020 the proceeds from the sale of notes of 2969 million net of discounts and issuance costs and the remaining funds from the sale of the eurodenominated notes were used to fund the redemption of the 450 million 430 notes due 2021 such redemption payments were made on december 4 2019 which required us to pay a make whole premium to the bondholders resulting in a loss of 235 million the remainder of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2019 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3973 million of which approximately 2731 million was held outside the united states at december 31 2018 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3962 million of which 2475 million was held outside the united states cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks we regularly hold cash in excess of nearterm requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders equity the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 468 at december 31 2019 compared to 500 at december 31 2018 the decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by the increase in stockholders equity of 2640 million for the period as a result of increase in current earnings of 6779 million offset by 1433 million in share repurchases and 2822 million of dividends paid net debt decreased 946 million during the period primarily due to a reduction in commercial paper partially offset by a net increase in longterm debt after debt issuances and redemptions in 2019 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 500 at december 31 2018 compared to 391 at december 31 2017 primarily due to the reduction in stockholders equity as a result of the 9068 million distribution of apergy 8950 million in share repurchases and 2836 million of dividends paid offset by 5703 million of current earnings net debt decreased 461 million during the period primarily due to a reduction in current maturities of long term debt partially offset by a reduction in cash levels to fund dividends and other operating purposes 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash flowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2019 



operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 1585 million outstanding in letters of credit surety bonds and performance and other guarantees with financial institutions which expire on various dates through 2028 these letters of credit and bonds are primarily issued as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

as of december 31 2019 and during the three year period then ended we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts however we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and 

decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2019 yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2752 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries including canada substantially all of the european countries mexico brazil china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges 

additionally we have designated the €600 million and €500 million of eurodenominated notes issued november 9 2016 and november 4 2019 respectively as a hedge of our net investment in eurodenominated operations we had also designated the €300 million notes due in 2020 as a net investment hedge prior to our redemption of the notes due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the us dollar the us dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases resulting in the recognition of a pretax gain loss of 224 million 452 million and 1253 million in other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations of accounting principles that affect the amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect supplemental information contained in our disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to us gaap and is consistently applied we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition  effective january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standard codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers under asc topic 606 a contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved that creates enforceable rights and obligations has commercial substance and where payment terms 

are identified and collectability is probable once we enter a contract it is evaluated to identify performance obligations for each performance obligation revenue is recognized as control of promised goods or services transfers to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services the amount of revenue recognized takes into account variable consideration such as discounts and volume rebates the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we include shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of goods and services 

inventories  inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries including all international subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or net realizable value other domestic inventories are stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates in addition the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist when some portion but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of or classified as assets held for sale or when a change in the composition of reporting units occurs for other reasons such as a change in segments 

when performing an impairment test we estimate fair value using the incomebased valuation method under the incomebased valuation method fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rate based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from these estimates the discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates we use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2019 reporting unit valuations ranged from 80 to 95 

concurrent with the timing of the annual impairment test effective october 1 2019 we changed our management structure which resulted in a change in our operating segments and reporting units as a result management tested goodwill for impairment before and after the segment change under the old and new reporting unit structures we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for each of our seven reporting units under the old structure and fifteen reporting units under the new structure concluding that the fair values of all of its reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values as such no goodwill impairment was recognized while we believe the assumptions used in the 2019 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results actual results may differ from expectations 

employee benefit plans  the valuation of our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates annually we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual and forecasted returns economic trends and and portfolio allocation our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams the plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting yearbyyear spot rates as disclosed in note 17 — employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements the 2019 weightedaverage discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit obligations ranged from 118 to 340 a general decrease from the 2018 rates which ranged from 183 to 435 the lower 2019 discount rates in the us are reflective of decreased market interest rates over this period a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the postretirement benefit obligations by approximately 313 million from the 

amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2019 our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately 15 million 

income taxes  we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies reserves are also estimated using more likely than not criteria for ongoing audits regarding federal state and nonus issues that are currently unresolved we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings as further described below with respect to us tax law changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tax reform act was enacted which permanently reduced the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate effective january 1 2018 as a result of the reduction in the us corporate income tax rate we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2017 and recognized a provisional tax benefit of 1720 million the tax reform act also imposed a tax for a onetime deemed repatriation of post1986 unremitted foreign earnings and profits through the year ended december 31 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded provisional tax expense related to the deemed repatriation of 1116 million payable over eight years 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant did not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act in accordance with the sab 118 guidance we recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 in accordance with sab 118 we finalized the financial reporting impact of the tax reform act in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded a 42 million net tax benefit which resulted in a 06 decrease in the effective tax rate as an adjustment to the provisional estimates as a result of additional regulatory guidance and changes in interpretations and assumptions we made as a result of the tax reform act 

risk retention insurance  we have significant accruals and reserves related to the selfinsured portion of our risk management program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions our experience and relevant industry data we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 

contingencies  we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues while we believe that the amount accrued todate is adequate future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 

restructuring  we establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management or when termination benefits are communicated exit costs may include contractual terminations and asset impairments as a result of an approved restructuring plan the accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

disposed and discontinued operations  from time to time we sell or discontinue or dispose of certain operations for various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale fair 

value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similartype entities the adjustments to fair value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates as noted previously in 2019 we recorded an impairment on assets held for sale due to the sale of finder in 2018 and 2017 no impairment charges were recorded due to operations sold discontinued or disposed 

stockbased compensation  we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock units and performance share awards we use the blackscholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars granted to employees the model requires that we estimate the expected life of the sar expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data for additional information related to the assumptions used see note 15 — equity and cash incentive program to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

recent accounting standards 

see note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow free cash flow as a percentage of revenue free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations net debt net capitalization net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital organic revenue growth and rightsizing costs are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings cash flows from operating activities debt or equity working capital revenue or restructuring costs as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings which is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level segment ebitda margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio free cash flow and free cash flow ratios are important measures of liquidity net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow and free cash flow ratios provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations equals free cash flow divided by earnings from continuing operations we believe that reporting adjusted working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods we believe that reporting rightsizing costs which include restructuring and other charges is important as it enables management and investors to better understand the financial impact of our broadbased cost reduction and operational improvement initiatives

management philosophy 

dover is committed to generating shareholder value through a combination of sustained longterm profitable growth operational excellence and superior free cashflow generation we foster an operating culture with high ethical standards that values accountability rigor trust respect and open communications designed to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness dover seeks to be a leader in our end markets as measured by market share customer satisfaction growth and return on invested capital our operating structure of three business segments allows for focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration shared services and manufacturing and advances the development of our executive talent our segment and executive management teams set strategic direction initiatives and goals provide oversight of strategy execution and achievement of these goals for our operating companies and with oversight from our board of directors make capital allocation decisions including organic investment initiatives major capital projects acquisitions and the return of capital to our shareholders 

we are also committed to creating sustainable business practices that protect the environment and through the development of products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals we have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation focusing on technologies which create tangible value for our customers each of dover’s segments is dedicated to this important initiative in our refrigeration  food equipment segment swep a manufacturer of brazed plate heat exchangers focuses on the conversion to sustainable and renewable energy usage in heat transfer their passive cooling 

unit for example uses natural cooling from the ground or groundwater to remove excess heat from interiors with the process requiring only a small amount of electricity for the circulation pumps which make this solution both very energy efficient and cost effective over the last 7 years markemimaje a marking and coding business within dover’s engineered systems segment has reduced its carbon emissions by 40 and produced 18 less waste by implementing an environmental health and safety program lastly in dover’s fluids segment opw a leader in fluid handling and car wash equipment released the 14 series fueling nozzle family that features patented and patentpending technology to prevent dripping of excess fuel while motorists refuel their vehicles 

company goals   

we are committed to driving shareholder returns through three key objectives first we are committed to achieving organic sales growth above that of gross domestic product or 3 to 5 annually on average over a longterm business cycle absent prolonged adverse economic conditions complemented by growth through strategic acquisitions second we continue to focus on improving returns on capital and segment margins through effective cost management and productivity initiatives including supply chain activities targeted thoughtful restructuring activities strategic pricing and portfolio management third we aim to generate free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 812 through strong earnings performance productivity improvements and active working capital management dover’s valuecreation strategy is supported by a financial policy that includes a prudent approach to financial leverage and a disciplined approach to capital allocation that allows for a balance between reinvestment and return of capital to shareholders we support achievement of these goals by 1 aligning management compensation with financial objectives 2 executing on welldefined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 investing in talent development programs 

business strategy 

to achieve our goals we are focused on executing the following three pillars of dover’s business strategy 

capturing growth potential in our key end markets and adjacencies 

dover’s three business segments focus on building enduring competitive advantages and leadership positions in end markets that are positioned for future growth we believe that our businesses are among the top suppliers in most markets and niches that we serve as defined by customer applications geographies or products which positions us well to capture future growth in such markets we capitalize on our engineering technology and design expertise and maintain an intense focus on meeting the needs of our customers and adding significant value to their operations through superior product performance safety and reliability and a commitment to after sales and service support we cultivate and maintain an entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve 

in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on growing industrial manufacturing and trade volumes continuous productivity improvement adoption of digital technologies and the industrial internet of things iiot sustainability and safety energy efficiency consumer product safety and growth of the middle class and consumption in emerging economies our engineered systems segment combines its engineering capabilities unique product advantages and niche applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing productivity solutions sustainability consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies our fluids segment is focused on accelerating growth within the chemicalplastics retail fueling fluid transfer industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support specifically we focus on capturing growth in the retail fueling hygienic and pharma and polymersplastics markets our refrigeration  food equipment segment is responding to our customers’ demand for increased energy efficiency and sustainability and unique merchandising solutions with innovative new products 

we aim to grow by making organic investments in research and development developing new products and technologies expanding our geographic coverage as well as by pursuing disciplined strategic acquisitions that enhance our portfolio and position dover for longterm growth we continually evaluate how our assets and capabilities can position dover to grow in markets adjacent to our core businesses for example new applications geographies product segments or adjacent technologies where dover can be advantaged 

improving profitability and return on invested capital 

we are committed to generating sustainable returns on invested capital well above the cost of capital across all of our businesses we continually evaluate and pursue opportunities to improve efficiency margin and return on capital we are intensely foc used on driving operational excellence and capturing the benefits of common ownership across our businesses we have implemented numerous productivity initiatives such as supply chain integration management shared service centers and lean manufacturing principles to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees our businesses place strong emphasis on continual product quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and to facilitate expansion into new product and geographic markets further we continue to make significant investments in talent development especially in the area of operational management and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success 

in 2018 we launched a margin expansion program designed to reduce our selling general and administrative cost base and rationalize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint across the portfolio in prior years we have invested in our global supply chain organization to capitalize on dover’s scale in procurement and in dover business services shared service centers to provide important transactional and valueadded services to our operating companies in the areas of finance information technology and human resources our shared service model allows us to leverage scale across dover increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls our shared service centers serve our operating companies by freeing resources normally dedicated to transactional services to allow those resources to focus on customers markets and product excellence 

additionally we focus on improving margins and returns by rigorously capturing synergies from our acquisitions and providing bestinclass corporate support and services through a lean corporate center 

disciplined capital allocation 

our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 812 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize returns on investment to do this we prioritize organic reinvestment to grow and strengthen our existing businesses we plan to make average annual investments in capital spending of approximately 2  4 of revenue with a focus on internal projects designed to expand markets develop products and improve productivity we also seek to deploy capital in disciplined acquisitions in our key end markets which include industrials printing  identification pumps hygienic  pharma fueling  transport and process solutions markets dover focuses primarily on bolton acquisitions applying strict selection criteria of market attractiveness including growth maturity performancebased competition business fit including sustained leading position revenue visibility favorable customer valueadd versus switching cost or risk and financial return profile accretive growth and margins doubledigit return on capital finally we have consistently returned cash to shareholders by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 63 years we also undertake opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy and completed 1 billion of share repurchases in 2018 we employ a prudent financial policy to support our capital allocation strategy which includes maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

portfolio development 

acquisitions   

our acquisition program has two key elements as a first priority we seek to acquire attractive addon businesses with a strong fit that enhance our existing franchises either by increasing their reach and customer access by broadening their product mix or by enhancing technological capability and customer valueadd second in the right circumstances we may strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces with all our acquisitions we seek businesses that have an accretive margin and a strong organic growth profile offer significant synergy opportunities and the potential to generate doubledigit return on capital 35 years after the acquisition is completed 

over the past three years 2016 through 2018 we have spent approximately 17 billion to purchase 10 businesses during 2018 we acquired two businesses for an aggregate consideration of 686 million net of cash acquired consistent with our acquisition program we acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the process solutions and food equipment end markets during 2017 we acquired two businesses for an aggregate consideration of 329 million net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration we acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the printing and identification platform during 2016 we acquired six businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 16 billion net of cash acquired four of these businesses– tokheim group sas fairbanks environmental ltd progauge and wayne fueling systems ltd expanded our fluids segments retail fueling portfolio and two of these businesses – alliance wireless technologies inc and ravaglioli spa group complemented the industrials platform within our engineered systems segment for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past three years see note 4 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses that expand the scope of our offering and make us an even more important supplier to our customers while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3  5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary adverse economic conditions our success in consistently growing the portfolio is also dependent on the ability to acquire and integrate businesses successfully within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal scorecard and defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created 

dispositions   

occasionally we may also sell or divest some of our businesses based on changes in specific market outlook structural changes in financial performance valuecreation potential or for other strategic considerations which may include an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets or focus on our higher margin growth spaces we also recognize that some smaller niche businesses in dover’s portfolio may have a greater valuecreation potential if owned by another parent with a larger presence and focus on a given niche we pragmatically consider such opportunities as part of our ongoing portfolio management and review processes and execute divestitures if the value created is determined to be at an appropriate premium to the value of such business to dover and allows dover shareholders to participate in the future valuecreation potential from a change in ownership 

during the past three years 2016 through 2018 we have sold businesses for aggregate cash consideration of 5830 million during 2018 there were no other material dispositions aside from the spinoff of apergy as previously discussed the financial position and results of operations for apergy have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented during 2017 we completed the sale of performance motorsports international and the consumer and industrial winch business of warn industries within the engineered systems segment as well as other smaller divestitures during 2016 we completed the sale of texas hydraulics and tipper tie within the engineered systems and refrigeration  food equipment segments respectively the disposal in 2017 and 2016 did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations for more details see note 5 — discontinued and disposed operations in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

business segments 

as noted previously we currently operate through three business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 18 — segment information in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing can be volatile particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

research and development 

our businesses invest to develop innovative products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs including demand for energyefficient products designed to help customers meet sustainability goals expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs 

our engineered systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation and performance and total cost of ownership improvement the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the engineered systems segment 

in addition to product innovation we are also investing in developing digital technologies in 2018 we opened our new digital labs center in the greater boston area the facility serves as the hub for our digital strategy and platform and as a research and development center for our markemimaje business unit which is part of our engineered systems segment we believe that the digital labs center will enhance the effectiveness of our products and fuel our commercial growth strategy by helping us make progress on digitization opportunities and by providing machine learning artificial intelligence iot and digital commerce capabilities our businesses pursue digital strategies based on customer needs and will now be able to leverage crosscompany capabilities developed at the digital labs center for example with the support of the digital labs center hydro which manufacturers chemical injecting proportioning dispensing and medicating equipment within our fluids segment launched hydro connect in 2018 hydro connect is a cloudbased iiot platform that gives end users 

increased visibility into their operations optimizes production reduces costs and increases customer satisfaction building on this momentum we launched a digital initiative in 2018 to help our businesses increase sales and further improve customer satisfaction through digital technology starting with dover food retail within our refrigeration  food equipment segment 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers none of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2018 given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are not significant businesses supplying the environmental solutions agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

seasonality 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the transportation construction environmental solutions commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase sequentially through the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

backlog   

backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm contracts primarily for the markets within our fluids and refrigeration  food equipment segments our total backlog relating to our businesses as of december 31 2018 and 2017 was 14 billion and 12 billion respectively 

competition   

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition a summary of our key competitors by end market within each of our segments follows 



international   

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our revenue in international markets particularly in developing economies in asia the middle east eastern europe and south america 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and other locations including australia canada china malaysia india mexico brazil eastern europe and the middle east 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 18 — segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

sustainability 

we are committed to creating economic value for shareholders by developing products designed to help our customers meet their sustainability goals in response to evolving regulatory and environmental standards we believe that sustainabilitydriven innovation presents a significant growth opportunity while contributing positively to enhanced resource efficiency and reduced waste accordingly over the past several years we have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation focusing on technologies that create tangible value for our customers each of dover’s segments is dedicated to this initiative for example in our refrigeration  food equipment segment swep a manufacturer of brazed plate heat exchangers has facilitated its customers’ conversion to more sustainable and renewable energy usage through heat transfer technology swep’s passive cooling unit uses natural cooling from the ground or groundwater to remove excess heat from interiors the process requires only a small amount of electricity for circulation pumps which makes this solution both energy efficient and cost effective over the last seven years markemimaje a marking and coding business within our engineered systems segment has reduced its carbon emissions by 40 and produced 18 less waste by implementing an environmental health and safety program lastly in our fluids segment opw a leader in fluid handling and car wash equipment released the 14 series fueling nozzle family that features patented and patentpending technology to prevent dripping of excess fuel while motorists refuel their vehicles 

we are also committed to fostering sustainable business practices across our businesses in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in 2010 in response to our concerns around global sustainability we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities as well as developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes goals objectives and related projects for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions to further promote our sustainability efforts we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we are near our goal for reducing overall energy intensity and have surpassed our goal for reducing greenhouse gas intensity we believe that our focus on sustainability results in enhanced efficiency in our operations which reduces costs improves margins and helps us achieve operational excellence we will continue to work proactively to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions amidst acquisition and business growth we have also participated as a voluntary respondent in the carbon disclosure project since 2010 and have maintained our scoring range since we began reporting 

all of our segments assess the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the opportunities associated with the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

other matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in pass through costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees   

we had approximately 24000 employees as of december 31 2018 

other information 

we make available free of charge through the investor information link on our website wwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our website is not incorporated into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

• our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition cash flows and cost of capital 

• we are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets 

approximately 48 and 46 of our revenues for 2018 and 2017 respectively were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on crossborder transactions and the translation of local currency results into us dollars could negatively impact our results of operations 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows which are presented in us dollars crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro chinese renminbi yuan swedish krona pound sterling indian rupee 

singapore dollar danish krone and canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

• increasing productservice and price competition by international and domestic competitors including new entrants and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

• our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products  digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation 

the success of new and improved products digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand which may result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences to deliver high quality innovative and competitive products to the market to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to thirdparty technologies and to stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new products digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production or marketing of new products digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

• new tariffs have resulted in increased prices and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

recently tariffs under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 were imposed on certain steel and aluminum products imported into the us which have increased the prices of these inputs increased prices for imported steel and aluminum products have led domestic sellers to respond with marketbased increases to prices for such inputs as well tariffs under section 301 of the trade expansion act were also imposed on goods imported from china in connection with chinas intellectual property practices which may increase the cost to our customers of our products manufactured in china as well as the cost of chinese sourced parts and components for our products manufactured in the us additional tariffs have been announced that may be imposed on goods imported from china in the future the new tariffs along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the us or other countries could result in further increased prices and a decreased available supply of steel and aluminum as well as additional imported components and inputs we may not be able to pass price increases on to our customers and may not be able to secure adequate alternative sources of steel and aluminum on a timely basis while retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods have not yet had a significant impact we cannot predict further developments the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of our businesses and customer demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes risks associated with emerging markets changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws regulations and policies including environmental employment and health and safety regulations data security laws data privacy laws exportimport laws tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits carbon emission regulations and energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates in addition the brexit referendum in the united kingdom in 2016 has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations although it is unknown what the full terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and other countries and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial position 

we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance or economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

  

• we could lose customers or generate lower revenue operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials including energy  or if we are unable to obtain raw materials 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations for example during 2018 we recorded rightsizing and other related costs of 728 million primarily related to actions taken on employee reductions facility consolidations and site closures product line exits and other associated asset charges these rightsizing activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses may reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements and unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize through our various programs any of the circumstances described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• our operations businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks 

we depend on our own and third party information technology “it” systems including cloudbased systems and managed service providers to store process and protect our information and support our business activities we also use our third party it systems to support employee data processing for our global work force and to support customer business activities such as transmitting payment information providing mobile monitoring services and capturing operational data additionally some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks if these technologies systems products or services are damaged cease to function properly are compromised due to employee error user error malfeasance system errors or other vulnerabilities or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software or other intrusions including by criminals nation states or insiders our business may be adversely impacted the impacts could include production downtimes operational delays and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers compromise of confidential proprietary or otherwise protected information including personal information and customer confidential data destruction corruption or theft of data manipulation disruption or improper use of these technologies systems products or services financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability adverse media coverage and legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions and damage to our reputation there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers by both statesponsored and criminal organizations moreover there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds these trends raise the risks from such events as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks it is possible for vulnerabilities in our it systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training systems monitoring and other technical security controls a breach response plan maintenance of backup and protective systems and security personnel our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise as cyber threats continue to evolve cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the us and globally and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more internetenabled products and offerings we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to strengthen our information security data protection and business continuity measures and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities 

• unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances or claims related to patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay 

damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects to cause property damage to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations for example during the fourth quarter of 2016 we determined there was a quality issue with a product component part in the fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the us consumer product safety commission “cpsc” during the first quarter of 2017 we announced a voluntary recall of the product in conjunction with the cpsc that has since been satisfactorily closed out in 2018 see note 15 — commitments and contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures which would reduce operating profit and cash flow in addition a product recall may require significant management attention product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• if the apergy spinoff together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with the spinoff of apergy we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs ruling together with an opinion of mcdermott will  emery llp our tax counsel substantially to the effect that among other things certain transactions to effect the spinoff will qualify as a taxfree reorganization for us federal income tax purposes under section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” and the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution to our shareholders under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and apergy including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion in addition we and apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment we would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if we had sold the apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the apergy common stock received in the distribution in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law we could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law respectively 

• the indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters 

in connection with the spinoff apergy agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the apergy business there can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations the failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

• our reputation ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate united states andor nonunited states laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

• our revenue operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights our businesses employ various measures to develop maintain and protect their intellectual property rights these measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of our businesses intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

• if we experience work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we have a number of collective bargaining units in the united states and various foreign collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity reputation consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows

for the year ended december 31 2018 consolidated revenue from continuing operations was 70 billion an increase of 02 billion or 25 as compared to the prior year this increase included organic revenue growth of 37 a favorable impact of 08 from foreign currency and acquisitionrelated growth of 05 partially offset by a 25 impact from dispositions overall customer pricing had a favorable impact of 10 on revenue for the year 

within our engineered systems segment revenue increased 750 million or 28 from the prior year reflecting organic growth of 58 a favorable impact from foreign currency of 15 and acquisitionrelated growth of 01 partially offset by a 46 impact from dispositions organic growth was broadbased across the segment with particular strength in our printing  identification platform and environmental solutions and defense businesses our fluids segment revenue increased 2423 million or 95 comprised of organic growth of 87 acquisitionrelated growth of 07 and a favorable foreign currency impact of 03 partially offset by a 02 impact from dispositions the organic growth was principally driven by strong activity in international retail fueling industrial pumps and other industrial markets within our refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue decreased 1460 million or 91 from the prior year including an organic revenue decline of 79 and a decline of 26 due to a disposition partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 07 and acquisitionrelated growth of 07 the organic decline was driven primarily by continued weak retail refrigeration markets especially with respect to refrigerated door cases 

gross profit was 26 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 305 million or 12 as compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to growth in sales volumes as well as the benefits of prior restructuring actions partially offset by l ost gross profit from divestitures gross profit margin was 366 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 371 for the prior year primarily as a result of unfavorable product mix and rising material costs in our refrigeration and food equipment segment and the impact of inefficiencies due to facility consolidations principally in our fluids segment for further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results see consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations respectively within mda 

bookings increased 51 over the prior year to 73 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 included in this result was a 53 increase in organic bookings a 17 favorable impact due to foreign exchange rates and a 05 increase in acquisitionrelated bookings which were partially offset by a 24 decline due to dispositions bookings increased 110 and 63 within our fluids and engineered systems segments respectively while bookings in our refrigeration  food equipment segment decreased 68 overall our booktobill increased from the prior year to 104 backlog as of december 31 2018 was 14 billion up from 12 billion from the prior year backlog as of december 31 2018 included 06 billion 05 billion and 03 billion in the engineered systems fluids and refrigeration and food equipment segments respectively 

from a geographic perspective revenue for the us our largest market grew by 21 organically over the prior year where broadbased growth in engineered systems and fluids was partially offset by our retail refrigeration business in the refrigeration and food equipment segment which is primarily a domestic business asia and europe also grew organically by 152 and 27 respectively over the prior year 

on may 9 2018 the company completed the separation of apergy corporation apergy from dover through the pro rata distribution of 100 of the common stock of apergy to dovers shareholders of record as of the close of business on april 30 2018 each dover shareholder received one share of apergy common stock for every two shares of dover common stock held as of the record date as a result apergy became an independent publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange and dover retained no ownership interest in apergy the distribution was structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes apergy holds entities conducting the upstream energy businesses previously included within our energy segment following the spinoff effective the second quarter of 2018 the company no longer has the energy segment and is aligned into three reportable segments the retained precision components bearings  compression and tulsa winch group businesses which were historically reported within the energy segment became a part of the fluids and engineered systems segments respectively see note 2 spinoff of apergy corporation and note 5 — discontinued and disposed operations in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information regarding the spin off of apergy 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we executed several programs in order to further optimize operations rightsizing programs in 2018 included 1 alignment of our cost structure in preparation for the apergy separation 2 broadbased selling general and administrative expense reduction initiatives and 3 initiation of footprint consolidation actions we recorded rightsizing and other related costs of 728 million for the year ended december 31 2018 which was comprised of 561 million of rightsizing costs and 167 million of other charges these costs primarily related to actions taken for employee reductions facility consolidations and site closures and product line divestitures and other asset charges designed to increase operating margin enhance operations and position us for sustained growth and investment these charges were broad based across all segments as well as corporate with costs incurred of 199 million in engineered systems 287 million in fluids 100 million in refrigeration  food equipment and 142 million at corporate these charges were recorded in cost of goods and services selling general and administrative expenses and other expense income net in the consolidated statement of earnings we expect to incur total future charges of approximately 20 million related to completion of our selling general and administrative expense reduction actions and continuation of our footprint consolidation initiatives approximately 15 million which will be incurred during the year ended december 31 2019 and approximately 5 million of which we expect to incur in 2020 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the us bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform act” in accordance with the sab 118 guidance we recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 in accordance with sab 118 we finalized the financial reporting impact of the tax reform act in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded a net tax benefit of 42 million which resulted in a 06 decrease in effective tax rate as an adjustment to provisional estimates as a result of additional regulatory guidance and changes in interpretations and assumptions we made as a result of the tax reform act on a full year basis the effective tax rate for 2018 was 185 inclusive of the sab 118 amounts

revenue 

for the year ended december 31 2018 revenue increased 1712 million or 25 to 70 billion compared with 2017 reflecting organic growth of 37 led by our fluids and engineered systems segments partially offset by our refrigeration and food equipment segment acquisitionrelated growth of 05 from our fluids and refrigeration and food equipment segments and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 08 revenue growth was partially offset by a 25 impact from dispositions within our engineered systems segment customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 10 in 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2017 revenue increased 7777 million or 129 to 68 billion compared with 2016 reflecting a growth from acquisitions of 109 an organic growth of 46 and a favorable impact of 05 from foreign currency translation offset by a decline from dispositions of 31 acquisitionrelated growth of 109 was led by the fluids and engineered systems segments largely due to the fullyear benefit from the 2016 acquisitions of wayne fueling systems ltd wayne within our fluids segment and ravaglioli spa group rav within our engineered systems segment as well as the 2017 acquisition of caldera graphics sas caldera within our engineered systems segment growth in organic revenue was largely driven by strong broadbased activity in the engineered systems segment organic growth also reflected strong shipments in our pumps and process solutions businesses in the fluids segment and solid retail refrigeration activity in the refrigeration  food equipment segment overall customer pricing was favorable impacting consolidated revenue 06 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2018 gross profit increased 305 million or 12 to 26 billion compared with 2017 primarily due to growth in sales volumes and benefits of prior restructuring actions partially offset by the loss of gross profits due to divestitures gross profit margin decreased 50 basis points as compared to the prior year due to unfavorable product mix and rising material costs in our refrigeration and food equipment segment and the impact of inefficiencies due to facility consolidations principally in our fluids segment 

for the year ended december 31 2017 gross profit increased 3015 million or 135 to 25 billion compared with 2016 primarily due to growth in sales volumes and benefits of prior restructuring actions as well as a reduction of a product recall accrual of 72 million compared to a fourth quarter 2016 charge of 232 million gross profit margin increased 20 basis points compared with 2016 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2018 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 57 million or 03 to 17 billion compared with 2017 primarily due to benefits from prior restructuring actions and decreases from dispositions within our engineered systems segment offset by an increase in restructuring costs of 60 million as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased 50 basis points in 2018 to 245 reflecting the leverage of costs on a higher revenue base and the decrease in expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2017 selling general and administrative expenses increased 2036 million or 134 to 17 billion compared with 2016 primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions in 2017 including acquisitionrelated amortization expense of 180 million higher restructuring charges of 159 million dispositionrelated costs for warn of 52 million and increased compensation costs as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses remained consistent with 2016 at approximately 25 

nonoperating items 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2018 interest expense net of interest income decreased 144 million or 105 to 1221 million compared with 2017 due to the 350 million 545 10year notes that were paid in march 2018 that resulted in lower outstanding longterm debt and lower interest expense compared to 2017 

for the year ended december 31 2017 interest expense net of interest income increased 72 million or 56 to 1365 million compared with 2016 due to the full year impact of the fourth quarter 2016 issuance of the €600 million of 125 eurodenominated notes and higher interest rates on commercial paper in 2017 

other income net 

for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 other income net was 44 million 23 million and 83 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2018 other income was primarily driven by nonoperating gains from our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans of 58 million for the year ended december 31 2017 other income was primarily due to nonoperating gains from our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans of 86 million partially offset by 69 million foreign exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances for the year ended december 31 2016 other income was primarily due to earnings on equity method investments of 33 million and net foreign exchange gains of 36 million 

gain on sale of businesses 

there were no significant dispositions in 2018 aside from the spinoff of apergy whose results are presented as discontinued operations 

for the year ended december 31 2017 gain on sale of businesses was 2031 million the gain was primarily due to the sales of pmi and the consumer and industrial winch business of warn warn both within the engineered systems segment in which we recognized gains on sale of 884 million and 1169 million respectively other immaterial dispositions completed during the year were recorded as a net loss of 22 million 

for the year ended december 31 2016 gain on sale of businesses was 966 million the gain was primarily due to the sales of texas hydraulics thi a custom manufacturer of fluid power components within the engineered systems segment and tipper tie a global supplier of processing and clip packaging machines within the refrigeration  food equipment segment upon disposal of thi and tipper tie we recognized gains on sale of 119 million and 85 million respectively 

the disposals in 2017 and 2016 did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations 

income taxes 

our businesses span the globe with 525 378 and 382 of our pretax earnings in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively generated in foreign jurisdictions foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that differ from the 210 us statutory tax rate as a result of our nonus business locations our effective foreign tax rate is typically lower than the us statutory tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 185 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 147 for the year ended december 31 2017 the 2018 and 2017 rates were impacted by 240 million and 517 million respectively of favorable net discrete items inclusive of the impact recorded for the us tax reform act in 2017 and the sab 118 adjustment in 2018 as described below 

on december 22 2017 the tax reform act was enacted which reduced the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate effective january 1 2018 as a result of the reduction in the us corporate income tax rate we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2017 and recognized a provisional tax benefit of 1720 million the tax reform act also imposed a tax for a onetime deemed repatriation of post1986 unremitted foreign earnings and profit through the year ended december 31 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded provisional tax expense related to the deemed repatriation of 1116 million payable over eight years 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act in accordance with the sab 118 guidance we recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 in accordance with sab 118 we finalized the financial reporting impact of the tax reform act in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded a 42 million net tax benefit which resulted in a 06 decrease in the effective tax rate as an adjustment to provisional estimates as a result of additional regulatory guidance and changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made as a result of the tax reform act 

for the year ended december 31 2016 our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 267 the effective tax rate was impacted by favorable net discrete items totaling 136 million principally related to settlements of uncertain tax matters 

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to   125 million we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

earnings from continuing operations 

for the year ended december 31 2018 earnings from continuing operations decreased 1555 million or 208 to 5911 million or eps of 389 compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7467 million or eps of 473 for the year ended december 31 2017 earnings decreased primarily because we did not record any gains from dispositions in 2018 compared to 2017 when we recorded net gains from dispositions of 1726 million or eps of 109 in 2018 we recorded a net tax benefit primarily from the tax reform act of 42 million or eps of 003 whereas in 2017 we recorded a net tax benefit of 549 million or eps of 035 the 2018 results included aftertax rightsizing and other costs of 583 million or eps of 038 whereas 2017 included rightsizing and other costs of 346 million or eps of 022 excluding these items in both years earnings from continuing operations increased 914 million or 165 in 2018 as a result of higher earnings due to increased sales volumes diluted earnings per share improved due to the benefit of the share repurchase programs announced in november 2017 

for the year ended december 31 2017 earnings from continuing operations increased 2445 million or 487 to 7467 million or eps of 473 compared with earnings from continuing operations of 5021 million or eps of 321 for the year ended december 31 2016 the 2017 results include a net benefit of 1726 million or eps of 109 from dispositions a net tax benefit primarily from the tax reform act of 549 million or eps of 035 aftertax rightsizing and other costs of 346 million or eps of 022 and a net benefit of 46 million or eps of 003 from a reduction to a previously recorded product recall accrual 

discontinued operations 

the results of discontinued operations for december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 include the historical results of apergy prior to its distribution on may 9 2018 the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 included costs incurred by dover to complete the spinoff of apergy amounting to 464 million and 153 million respectively reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations due to lumpsum payments made in 2018 for apergy participants in the dover us pension plan noncash settlement costs of approximately 92 million were classified within discontinued operations

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food equipment end markets 



2018 versus 2017 

refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased 1460 million or 91 compared to the prior year reflecting an organic revenue decline of 79 the impact from product line dispositions of 26 partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth of 07 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 07 customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 08 in 2018 

• refrigeration revenue representing 824 of segment revenue decreased 1085 million or 83 compared to the prior year principally driven by weak capital spending and deferred remodel programs by key us retail refrigeration customers as well as certain product line exits the retail refrigeration shortfall was partially offset by increased demand for heat exchanger products most notably in europe 

• food equipment revenue representing 176 of segment revenue decreased 376 million or 128 compared to the prior year due to project timing and market softness in our can shaping equipment and foodservice equipment businesses partially offset by the addition of sales from our rosario acquisition

refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased 898 million or 317 compared to the prior year primarily related to the 850 million gain on sale of tipper tie in 2016 as well as 101 million of lower earnings in 2017 due to the divestiture an increase of 131 million of restructuring expenses in 2017 compared to the prior year and a 40 million loss on sale of a nonus business in 2017 segment margin decreased 540 basis points to 121 primarily driven by the aforementioned gain on sale of tipper tie in 2016 and increase in restructuring expenses excluding the impact of dispositions and restructuring segment earnings increased 208 million or 110 and segment margins increased 80 basis points reflecting increased organic volume and improved productivity which more than offset increased materials cost most notably steel 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 498 million compared to 2017 this increase was driven primarily by higher continuing earnings of 469 million excluding noncash activity from depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of businesses and significantly lower tax payments in the current year due to a lower tax rate in 2018 as well as tax payments made in the prior year for dispositions the increase was offset by higher investments in working capital relative to the prior year in support of organic bookings and timing of year end revenue 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 48 million compared to 2016 this increase was primarily driven by higher continuing earnings of 1716 million excluding noncash activity from depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of businesses the increase was largely offset by timing of year end revenue and increased tax payments of 1676 million which includes 690 million of federal and state tax payments for dispositions 

pension and other postretirement activity total cash used in conjunction with pension plans during 2018 was 259 million including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our nonqualified supplemental pension plan 

the funded status of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements due to the overfunded status of this plan the company did not make contributions in 2018 2017 or 2016 and expects to make minimal contributions if any in the near term 

our international pension obligations are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2018 2017 and 2016 totaled 60 million 80 million and 84 million respectively in 2019 we expect to contribute approximately 54 million to our nonus plans our nonqualified supplemental pension plans are funded through company assets as benefits are paid in 2018 a total of 194 million in benefits were paid under these plans see note 16 — employee benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital we believe adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue 



adjusted working capital increased from december 31 2017 by 326 million or 33 to 10 billion at december 31 2018 which reflected an increase in receivables of 483 million an increase in inventory of 718 million and an increase in accounts payable of 875 million excluding acquisitions dispositions and the effects of foreign currency translation adjusted working capital increased by 661 million or 68 and decreased 512 million or 49 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

investing activities 

cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash inflows from proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments partially offset by cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

• acquisitions in 2018 we deployed 686 million to acquire two businesses in comparison we acquired two businesses in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 272 million total acquisition spend in 2016 was 15617 million and was comprised of six businesses see note 4 — acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions 

• proceeds from sale of businesses in 2018 we generated cash proceeds of 39 million primarily due to cash received on a sale in the prior year cash proceeds of 3727 million in 2017 were primarily from the sale of pmi and warn in 2016 we generated cash proceeds of 2064 million primarily from the sale of thi and tipper tie 

• capital spending capital expenditures primarily to support productivity and new product launches were 1710 million in 2018 1701 million in 2017 and 1396 million in 2016 our capital expenditures remained relatively flat in 2018 compared to 2017 but increased 305 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily within fluids 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2019 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper or by accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

• cash received from apergy net of cash distributed  in connection with the separation of apergy from dover apergy 

incurred borrowings to fund a onetime cash payment of 7000 million to dover in connection with dovers contribution to apergy of stock and assets relating to the businesses spun off with apergy dover received net cash of 6896 million upon separation which reflects 104 million of cash held by apergy at the time of distribution and retained by it in in connection with its separation from dover 

• repurchase of common stock including prepayment under an accelerated share repurchase program during the year ended december 31 2018 we used 450 million to repurchase 440608 shares under our january 2015 authorization which expired on january 9 2018 under a new share repurchase authorization adopted by the board of directors in february 2018 we repurchased 1753768 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1500 million and used 700 million to repurchase a total of 8542566 shares through an accelerated share repurchase transaction which concluded in december 2018 we funded the accelerated share repurchase primarily with funds received from apergy in connection with the consummation of the apergy spinoff for the year ended december 31 2017 we used 1050 million to repurchase 1059682 shares under the january 2015 authorization 

  

• longterm debt commercial paper and notes payable net during 2018 we repaid the companys 3500 million 545 notes which matured on march 15 2018 and decreased net borrowings from commercial paper by 107 million during the 2017 period we decreased net borrowings from commercial paper by 1826 million with the cash proceeds from the sale of pmi and warn during 2016 we increased net borrowings from commercial paper by 2548 million primarily for purposes of funding acquisitions additionally in november 2016 we issued €6000 million of 125 eurodenominated notes due in 2026 the proceeds of 6564 million from this issuance net of discounts and issuance costs were primarily used for payment of a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of wayne 

• dividend payments total dividend payments to common shareholders were 2836 million in 2018 2840 million in 2017 and 2677 million in 2016 our dividends paid per common share increased 4 to 190 per share in 2018 compared to 182 per share in 2017 which represents the 63rd consecutive year that our dividend has increased the number of common shares outstanding decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to our share repurchase programs 

• net proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards there were no proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards in 2018 and 2017 with the adoption of accounting standards update 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 beginning january 1 2017 this activity is reflected in operating activities for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 and we have elected to reflect this cash flow presentation prospectively proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards were 84 million in 2016 payments to settle tax obligations on share exercises were 463 million 184 million and 157 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively these tax payments generally increase or decrease correspondingly to the number of exercises in a particular year 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

our cash flows from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 used generated 143 million 485 million and 1035 million respectively these cash flows primarily reflect the operating results of apergy prior to its separation during the second quarter of 2018 cash flows used in discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily reflects cash payments of spinoff costs of 464 million and capital expenditures of 237 million partially offset by cash provided by operations of approximately 554 million cash flows generated for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 primarily reflects cash provided by operating activities of approximately 962 million and 1283 million respectively partially offset by capital expenditures 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions paying dividends repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2018 we generated free cash flow of 6182 million representing 88 of revenue free cash flow in 2017 was 5693 million or 83 of revenue and 5950 million or 98 of revenue in 2016 the full year increase in 2018 free cash flow reflects higher cash flow provided by operations due to higher operating earnings as previously mentioned however the 2018 free cash flow includes cash payments related to restructuring initiatives of 520 million whereas the restructuring payments were 226 million in 2017 the 2017 decrease in free cash flow compared to 2016 reflects higher capital expenditures primarily within our fluids segment 

  

capitalization 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock we maintain a 10 billion fiveyear unsecured committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks which expires on november 10 2020 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin under this facility we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2018 and had a coverage ratio of 96 to 10 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

on march 15 2018 the outstanding 545 notes with a principal value of 3500 million matured the repayment of debt was funded by the companys commercial paper program and through a reduction of existing cash balances 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2018 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3962 million of which approximately 2475 million was held outside the united states at december 31 2017 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 7540 million of which 6098 million was held outside the united states the reduction in cash held outside the united states was primarily the result of repatriating 5344 million to the united states during the year ended december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks we regularly hold cash in excess of nearterm requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders equity the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 500 at december 31 2018 compared to 391 at december 31 2017 the increase in this ratio was driven primarily by the reduction of our net capitalization of 17 billion for the period primarily due to the reduction in stockholders equity as a result of the 9068 million distribution of apergy 8950 million in share repurchases and 2836 million of dividends paid offset by 5703 million of current earnings net debt decreased 461 million during the period primarily due to a reduction in current maturities of long term debt as a result of the repayment of 3500 million note on march 15 2018 partially offset by a reduction in cash levels to fund dividends and other operating purposes 

  

our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 391 at december 31 2017 compared to 463 at december 31 2016 primarily due to changes in net debt during the period net debt decreased 4582 million as a result of 4048 million higher cash and cash equivalents the decrease was also impacted by the repayment of commercial paper partially offset by foreign currency translation on our eurodenominated notes 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2018 



operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 1445 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire on various dates in 2019 through 2028 these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2018 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

as of december 31 2018 and during the three year period then ended we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts however we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2018 yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 7814 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding 

fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries including canada substantially all of the european countries mexico brazil argentina china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges 

additionally the company has designated the €300 million and €600 million of eurodenominated notes issued december 4 2013 and november 9 2016 respectively as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income loss to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the us dollar the us dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases resulting in the recognition of a gain of 452 million and a loss of 1253 million in other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing however such contracts outstanding at december 31 2018 were not significant 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of gaap gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 

revenue   recognition  effective january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standard codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers   topic 606” or “asc 606” under topic 606 a contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved that creates enforceable rights and obligations has commercial substance and where payment terms are identified and collectability is probable once we enter a contract it is evaluated to identify performance obligations for each performance obligation revenue is recognized as control of promised goods or services transfers to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or 

services the amount of revenue recognized takes into account variable consideration such as discounts and volume rebates the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we include shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of goods and services 

inventories  inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries including all international subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or net realizable value other domestic inventories are stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates in addition the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 

when performing an impairment test we estimate fair value using the incomebased valuation method under the incomebased valuation method fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rate based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from these estimates the discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates we use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2018 reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 to 95   

we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing of our seven identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the impairment tests performed the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 150 as such no goodwill impairment was recognized while we believe the assumptions used in the 2018 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results if market conditions worsen or persist for an extended period of time an impairment of goodwill or assets may occur we will continue to monitor the longterm outlook and forecasts including estimated future cash flows for these businesses and the impact on the carrying value of goodwill and assets 

employee benefit plans  the valuation of our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates annually we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns economic trends and portfolio allocation our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams the plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting yearbyyear spot rates as disclosed in note 16 — employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements the 2018 weightedaverage discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit obligations ranged from 183 to 435 a general increase from the 2017 rates which ranged from 194 to 365 the higher 2018 discount rates in the us are reflective of increased market interest rates over this period a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the postretirement benefit obligations by approximately 279 million from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2018 our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately 14 million 

income taxes  we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning 

strategies reserves are also estimated using more likely than not criteria for ongoing audits regarding federal state and international issues that are currently unresolved we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings as further described below with respect to us tax law changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tax reform act was enacted which permanently reduced the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate effective january 1 2018 as a result of the reduction in the us corporate income tax rate we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2017 and recognized a provisional tax benefit of 1720 million the tax reform act also imposed a tax for a onetime deemed repatriation of post1986 unremitted foreign earnings and profit through the year ended december 31 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded provisional tax expense related to the deemed repatriation of 1116 million payable over eight years 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act in accordance with the sab 118 guidance we recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 in accordance with sab 118 we finalized the financial reporting impact of the tax reform act in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded a 42 million net tax benefit which resulted in a 06 decrease in the effective tax rate as an adjustment to the provisional estimates as a result of additional regulatory guidance and changes in interpretations and assumptions we made as a result of the tax reform act 

risk retention insurance  we have significant accruals and reserves related to the selfinsured portion of our risk management program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions our experience and relevant industry data we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 

contingencies  we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues while we believe that the amount accrued todate is adequate future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 

restructuring  we establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management or when termination benefits are communicated exit costs include future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations in addition asset impairments may be recorded as a result of an approved restructuring plan the accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

disposed and discontinued operations  from time to time we sell or discontinue or dispose of certain operations for various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations including goodwill to their estimated fair market value these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similartype entities the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates no impairment charges were recorded in 2018 2017 or 2016 

stockbased compensation  we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock units and performance share awards we use the blackscholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars granted to employees the model requires that we estimate the expected life of the sar expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data for additional information related to the assumptions used see note 14 — equity and cash incentive program to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

recent accounting standards 

see note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow net debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings cash flows from operating activities debt or equity working capital or revenue as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings which is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level segment ebitda margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of free cash flow net debt and net capitalization can be found above in this item 7 mda we believe that reporting adjusted working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

the following table shows the percentage of total revenue and segment earnings generated by each of our four operating segments for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



spinoff of energy businesses 

on december 7 2017 we announced that we plan to spinoff on a taxfree basis our upstream energy businesses within our energy segment collectively the “wellsite” business into a standalone publicly traded company to be named at a later date 

upon completion of the spinoff wellsite will be a leading provider of a full range of oil and gas production technologies and solutions wellsite productivity software and industrial internet iiot solutions wellsite will also be the industry leader in the development and production of polycrystalline diamond cutters used for oil and gas exploration wellsite serves many of the most attractive segments in the oil and gas industry with its portfolio of leading brands including norris  harbisonfischer  accelerated pcs ferguson norrisealwellmark spirit  quartzdyne  windrock and uss  we expect to complete the spinoff of the wellsite businesses in may of 2018 subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions upon separation the historical results of wellsite  will be presented as discontinued operations as it represents a strategic shift in operations with a material impact to the consolidated financial statements 

as part of the spinoff wellsite is expected to raise 700 million to 800 million of new debt the proceeds of which will be paid to dover in the form of a dividend we anticipate returning the proceeds to shareholders as the primary source of funding for 1 billion of share repurchases to be completed by the end of 2018 

management philosophy 

our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer satisfaction growth profitability and return on invested capital our operating structure of four business segments allows for focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration shared services and manufacturing and advances the development of our executive talent our segment and executive management set strategic direction initiatives and goals and provide oversight for our operating companies and also allocate and manage capital are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services we foster an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication designed to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness 

in addition we are committed to creating value for our customers employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and the development of products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals we have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation focusing on technologies which create tangible value for our customers most notably we believe that product innovations like the lario singlepass digital textile printer within our engineered systems segment evoclean laundry system within our fluids segment advansorflex co 2  refrigeration system and vista elite cooler door within our refrigeration  food equipment segment and spirit genesis pump off controller within our energy segment help to make a positive difference for the environment while providing value to shareholders and customers 

our operating companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow 

company goals   

we are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives first we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth of 3 to 5 over a longterm business cycle absent adverse economic conditions complemented by acquisition growth second we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives including supply chain activities targeted thoughtful restructuring activities strategic pricing and portfolio shaping third we are committed to generating adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 10 through strong earnings performance productivity improvements and active working capital management we support these goals through 1 alignment of management compensation with financial objectives 2 welldefined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 talent development programs 

business strategy 

to achieve our goals we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies 

positioning ourselves for growth 

we have aligned our business segments to focus on the needs of customers in key end markets that are wellpositioned for future growth we capitalize on our expertise while maintaining an intense focus on our customers and their needs we maintain and emphasize our entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve 

in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on trends in the areas of global energy demand continuous productivity improvement sustainability energy efficiency consumer product safety and growth of consumerism in emerging economies our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology and capabilities unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing productivity solutions sustainability consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies the fluids segment is focused on accelerated growth within the chemicalplastics retail fueling fluid transfer industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support in particular we are pursuing further growth 

in the retail fueling hygienic and pharma and polymersplastics markets our refrigeration  food equipment segment is responding to our customers’ energy efficiency and sustainability concerns and unique merchandising requirements with innovative new products our energy segment is focusing on expansion in high growth basins and technologies accelerating capabilities to drive international growth and increasing investment in automation to drive customer productivity and cash flow 

capturing the benefits of common ownership 

we are committed to operational excellence and capturing the benefits of common ownership through formalized company sponsored programs and an embedded culture of continuous improvement we focus on adjusted free cash flow generation productivity to support ongoing investment in product innovation and customer expansion activities the continuous evaluation of operating efficiencies and the continued consolidation of back office support through these programs we have implemented various productivity initiatives such as supply chain management and lean manufacturing to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees we foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization to ensure success our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets further we continue to make significant investments in talent development recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success 

additionally in 2016 we began to invest in our dover business services dbs shared service centers which brings significant value to dover by providing important transactional and value added services to our operating companies in the areas of finance information technology and human resources our model allows us to leverage scale across dover increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls ultimately our mission is to serve our operating companies by freeing resources normally dedicated to transactional services to allow those resources to focus on customers markets and product excellence 

disciplined capital allocation 

our businesses generate annual adjusted free cash flow of approximately 10 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize returns on investment to do this we grow and support our existing businesses with average annual investment in capital spending of approximately 2 to 25 of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets develop products and boost productivity businesses in our portfolio are continually evaluated for strategic fit and our acquisitions are targeted in our key growth markets which include printing and identification refrigeration and food equipment pumps fueling and transport hygienic and pharma and select energy markets we consistently return cash to shareholders by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 62 years we will also plan to complete 1 billion of share repurchases by the end of 2018 as part of our capital allocation strategy 

portfolio development 

acquisitions   

our acquisition program has two key elements first we seek to acquire value creating addon businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers or by broadening their product mix second in the right circumstances we will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces with all our acquisitions we seek businesses that have an accretive margin and a strong organic growth profile and also offer significant synergy opportunities 

over the past three years  2015  through 2017  we have spent over 22 billion  to purchase 13  businesses during 2017  we acquired three  businesses for an aggregate consideration of 431 million  net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration these businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the engineered systems and fluids segments during 2016 we acquired six  businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 16 billion  net of cash acquired these businesses include tokheim group sas fairbanks environmental ltd progauge and wayne fueling systems ltd to expand our fluids segments retail fueling portfolio and alliance wireless technologies inc and ravaglioli spa group to complement the industrials platform within our engineered systems segment during 2015 we acquired four  businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 5678 million  net of cash acquired these businesses include gala industries and reduction engineering scheer to expand our fluids segments plastics and polymers product and integrated systems portfolio in addition in 2015 we acquired jk group a global manufacturer and provider of innovative digital inks for the textile printing market to complement the printing  identification platform within our engineered systems segment for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 3 — acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses which expand the scope of our offering and make us a more important supplier to our customers while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3 to 5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal scorecard and defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created 

dispositions   

occasionally we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions or for strategic considerations which include an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces during the past three years  2015  through 2017  we have sold seven  businesses for aggregate consideration of 13 billion  

during 2017 we completed the sale of performance motorsports international and the consumer and industrial winch business of warn industries within the engineered systems segment as well as other smaller divestitures these disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations 

during 2016 we completed the sale of texas hydraulics and tipper tie within the engineered systems and refrigeration  food equipment segments respectively in addition during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the divestiture of the walkin cooler business of hillphoenix within the refrigeration  food equipment segment these disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations 

during 2015 we completed the sale of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace the financial position and results of operations for the 2015 divestitures have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented for more details see note 4 — disposed and discontinued operations  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

business segments 

as noted previously we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments engineered systems fluids refrigeration  food equipment and energy for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 17 — segment information  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment is focused on the design manufacture and service of critical equipment and components within the printing  identification and industrials platforms as described below 



safety requirements and growth in emerging markets in addition our businesses serving the textile market are benefiting from a significant shift from analog to digital printing resulting from shorter runs and more complex fashion designs as well as increasing regulatory and environmental standards 

 

our businesses serving the global vehicle service market provide products and services used primarily in vehicle repair and maintenance including light and heavy duty vehicle lifts wheel service equipment vehicle diagnostics and vehicle collision repair solutions products are sold to national dealership networks original equipment manufacturers oem national multishop operations mso groups independent repair and service shops large national accounts and governmenttransit customers through a network of distributors and channel partners 

the businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps power clamps rotary and linear mechanical indexers conveyors pick and place units glove ports and manipulators as well as endofarm robotic grippers slides and end effectors these products serve a very broad market including food processing packaging paper processing medical electronic automotive nuclear and general industrial products 

our businesses serving waste and recycling markets provide products and services for the refuse collection industry and for onsite processing and compaction of trash and recyclable materials products are sold to municipal customers national accounts and independent waste haulers through a network of distributors and directly in certain geographic areas 

engineered systems products are manufactured primarily in the united states europe and asia and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

fluids 

our fluids segment is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling chemical hygienic oil and gas and industrial end markets  we strive to optimize safety efficiency reliability and environmental sustainability through innovative fluid handling and information management solutions the segment serves three broad global end markets fueling  transport pumps and hygienic  pharma 

 

 

 

fluids products are manufactured primarily in the united states europe china and brazil and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food equipment end markets 

 

 

the majority of the refrigerationfood systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the refrigeration  food equipment segment are used by the supermarket industry including “bigbox” retail and convenience stores the commercialindustrial refrigeration industry institutional and commercial food service and food production markets and beverage canmaking industries refrigeration  food equipments products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

energy 

our energy segment serves the drilling  production bearings  compression and automation end markets this segment is a provider of customerdriven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of fuels worldwide this segment consists of the following end markets 

 

 

 

our energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels we manufacture our products primarily in north america and our sales are concentrated in north america with an increasing level of international sales directed primarily to europe australia and asia 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing can be volatile particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

research and development 

our businesses invest to develop innovative products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2017  we spent 1250 million  for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2016  and 2015  research and development spending totaled 1045 million  and 1150 million  respectively 

our engineered systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the engineered systems segment 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers none of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2017  given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are not significant businesses supplying the waste and recycling agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

seasonality 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the transportation construction waste and recycling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase sequentially through the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

backlog   

backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm contracts primarily for the markets within our fluids and refrigeration  food equipment segments our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of december 31 2017  and 2016  was 12 billion  and 11 billion  respectively 

competition   

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition a summary of our key competitors by end market within each of our segments follows 



international   

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia the middle east and eastern europe 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and with increasing emphasis australia canada china malaysia india mexico brazil eastern europe and the middle east 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and

sustainability 

in response to our concerns around global sustainability i n 2010 we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities as well as developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes goals objectives and related projects for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions to further promote our sustainability efforts we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we are near our goal for reducing overall energy intensity and have surpassed our goal for reducing greenhouse gas intensity we will continue to work proactively to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions amidst acquisition and business growth we have also participated as a voluntary respondent in the carbon disclosure project since 2010 and have maintained our scoring range since we began reporting 

all of our segments assess the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the opportunities associated with the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

other matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in pass through costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees   

we had approximately 29000  employees as of december 31 2017

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

our energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates global economic conditions and related energy demands 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition cash flows and cost of capital 

 

approximately 44  and 42  of our revenues for 2017  and 2016  respectively were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

the oil and gas industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns of varying length and severity most recently the oil and gas industry experienced a significant downturn in 2015 and 2016 demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies the level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have been characterized by significant volatility in recent years in particular the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and 2015 on significant over supply and declined dramatically 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control prices of oil began to recover in late 2016 but there can be no assurance that increases will continue we expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects another future significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy and pumps products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

we have previously announced in 2017 a plan to pursue a taxfree spinoff of our wellsite business into a standalone publiclytraded company we expect to complete the spinoff in may of 2018 subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions however unanticipated developments including delays in obtaining tax rulings changes in the macroeconomic environment uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed spinoff or cause the proposed spinoff to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spinoff we also have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed spinoff which may exceed our current expectations 

executing the proposed spinoff requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business additionally our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles pending the completion of the spinoff following the proposed spinoff the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spinoff not occurred in addition investor sentiment could result in excess selling causing greater volatility in our share price following the consummation of the proposed spinoff finally if we fail to complete the spinoff we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets 

 

a condition to the spinoff is the receipt by us of either i a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs ruling together with an opinion of mcdermott will  emery llp our tax counsel substantially to the effect that among other things certain transactions to effect the spinoff will qualify as a taxfree reorganization for us federal income tax purposes under section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the “code” and the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution to our shareholders under section 355 of the code or ii an opinion of mcdermott will  emery llp our tax counsel substantially to the effect that among other things certain transactions to effect the spinoff will qualify as a taxfree reorganization for us federal income tax purposes under section 368a1d of the code and the distribution of shares of wellsite will qualify as a taxfree distribution to our shareholders under section 355 of the code the irs ruling if obtained and the opinion of tax counsel will rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and wellsite including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling if obtained or the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the irs ruling if obtained and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions 

in the opinion in addition we and wellsite intend for certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment we would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if we had sold the wellsite common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the wellsite common stock received in the distribution in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law we could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law respectively 

 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows which are presented in us dollars crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling swiss franc chinese renminbi yuan brazilian real and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers certain of our businesses sell their products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand which may result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences to deliver high quality innovative and competitive products to the market to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to thirdparty technologies and to stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new products and services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws regulations and policies including environmental and employment regulations data security laws data privacy laws exportimport laws tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits carbon emission regulations and other similar programs failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment data security data privacy and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates in addition we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance or economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

  

 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations for example during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded rightsizing and other related costs of 563 million to better align our cost structure in preparation for the wellsite separation these rightsizing activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction 

activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses may reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize through our various programs any of the circumstances described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we depend on our own and third party information technology “it” systems including cloudbased systems to store and process information and support our business activities we also use our third party it systems to support customer business activities such as transmitting payment information providing mobile monitoring services and capturing operational data additionally some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks if these technologies systems products or services are damaged cease to function properly are compromised due to employee error user error malfeasance system errors or other vulnerabilities or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software or other intrusions including by criminals nation states or insiders our business may be adversely impacted the impacts could include production downtimes operational delays and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers compromise of confidential proprietary or otherwise protected information including personal and customer data destruction corruption or theft of data manipulation disruption or improper use of these technologies systems products or services financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability adverse media coverage and legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions and damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls a breach response plan maintenance of backup and protective systems and security personnel our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances or claims related to patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects to cause property damage to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations for example during the fourth quarter of 2016 we determined there was a quality issue with a product component part in the fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the us consumer product safety commission “cpsc” during the first quarter of 2017 we announced a voluntary recall of the product in conjunction with the cpsc see note 14 — commitments and contingent liabilities  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures which would reduce operating profit and cash flow in addition a product recall may require significant management attention product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet 

their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

our growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives if we are unsuccessful in these efforts our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies 

  

 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate united states andor nonunited states laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights our businesses employ various measures to develop maintain and protect their intellectual property rights these measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of our businesses intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value a decrease in the longterm economic outlook and future cash flows of our businesses could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets including goodwill charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized 

 

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2017  although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings if our current credit ratings deteriorate then our borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under our fiveyear credit facility and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

we have a number of collective bargaining units in the united states and various foreign collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity reputation consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the company’s products exposure to hazardous substances patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel at least quarterly review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued todate and the availability and extent of insurance coverage the company has reserves for other legal matters that are probable and estimable and at december 31 2017  and 2016  these reserves are not significant while it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions in the opinion of management based on the aforementioned reviews the company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

on december 7 2017 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to spinoff our upstream energy businesses within the our energy segment collectively the “wellsite” business through a us taxfree spinoff to shareholders we expect to complete the separation in may of 2018 subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions we have incurred 153 million  of costs associated with the transaction which were recorded as a corporate expense in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings these transaction costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities within finance legal and information system functions upon separation the historical results of wellsite  will be presented as discontinued operations

revenue 

for the year ended december 31 2017  revenue increased   10 billion  or 152  to 78 billion  compared with 2016  reflecting organic growth  of 78  acquisitionrelated growth of 97  and a favorable  impact from foreign currency translation of 04  partially offset by a 27  impact from dispositions growth in organic revenue was largely driven by improved market conditions in us oil and gasrelated end markets for the energy segment as well as strong broadbased activity in the engineered systems segment organic growth also reflected strong shipments in our pumps and hygienic  pharma businesses in the fluids segment and solid retail refrigeration activity in the refrigeration  food equipment segment acquisitionrelated growth of 97  was led by the fluids and engineered systems segments largely due to the fullyear benefit from the 2016 acquisitions of wayne fueling systems ltd wayne within our fluids segment and ravaglioli spa group rav within our engineered systems segment as well as the 2017 acquisition of caldera graphics sas caldera within our engineered systems segment overall customer pricing was favorable impacting consolidated revenue 06  

for the year ended december 31 2016  revenue decreased   1620 million  or 23  to 68 billion  compared with 2015  reflecting an organic decline  of 54  a 30  impact from dispositions and an unfavorable impact of 10  from foreign currency translation offset by growth  from acquisitions of 71  decline in organic revenue was attributable to weakness in us oil and gasrelated end markets as well as reduced capital spending by our customers acquisitionrelated growth of 71 was largely driven by the acquisitions of tokheim group sas tokheim and wayne within our fluids segment and rav within our engineered systems segment as well as the fullyear benefit from the fourth quarter 2015 acquisitions 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2017  gross profit increased   4184 million  or 169  to 29 billion  compared with 2016  primarily due to growth in sales volumes and benefits of prior restructuring actions as well as a reduction of a product recall accrual of 72 million  compared to a fourth quarter 2016 charge of 232 million  gross profit margin increased 50 basis points primarily due to margin improvements in our engineered systems and energy segments 

for the year ended december 31 2016  gross profit decreased   962 million  or 37  to 25 billion  compared with 2015  primarily due to the decline in sales volumes and a product recall charge of 232 million  partially offset by supply chain cost containment initiatives and the benefits of prior restructuring actions gross profit margin declined 50 basis points primarily due to margin declines in our energy segment 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2017  selling general and administrative expenses increased   2184 million  or 124  to 20 billion  compared with 2016  primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions in 2016 including acquisitionrelated amortization expense of 157 million wellsite separation costs of 153 million  higher restructuring charges of 108 million  dispositionrelated costs for warn of 52 million  and increased compensation costs as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased 70 basis points in 2017  to 252  reflecting the leverage of costs on a higher revenue base partially offset by the aforementioned increases in expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2016  selling general and administrative expenses increased   1101 million  or 67  to 18 billion  compared with 2015  reflecting the impact of acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization expense acquisitionrelated deal costs and increased headcount the increase is also impacted by increased investment in dbs offset by lower restructuring charges and the benefits of previously implemented cost reduction actions as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased 220 basis points in 2016 to 259 reflecting deleveraging of fixed administrative costs and acquisitionrelated costs on lower revenue 

nonoperating items 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2017  interest expense net of interest income increased   71 million  or 54  to 1367 million  compared with 2016  due to the full year impact of the fourth quarter 2016 issuance of the €600 million  of 125 eurodenominated notes and higher interest rates on commercial paper in 2017 

for the year ended december 31 2016  interest expense net of interest income increased 24 million  or 19  to 1296 million  compared with 2015 this increase was due to higher interest rates on commercial paper year over year and the fourth quarter 2016 issuance of the €600 million  of 125 eurodenominated notes offset in part by the full year impact of lower interest on 4000 million 315 notes which replaced the 3000 million 4875 notes in october 2015 

other expense income net 

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  other expense income net was 70 million  79 million  and 71 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  other expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss of 72 million resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances for the year ended december 31 2016  other income was primarily due to earnings on equity method investments of 33 million and a net foreign exchange gain of 29 million for the year ended december 31 2015  other income was primarily due to earnings on equity method investments of 33 million and an insurance settlement for property damage of 36 million partially offset by a net foreign exchange loss of 16 million 

gain on sale of businesses 

for the year ended december 31 2017  gain on sale of businesses was 2031 million  the gain was primarily due to the sales of pmi and warn both within the engineered systems segment in which we recognized gains on sale of 884 million  and 1169 million  respectively other immaterial dispositions completed during the year were recorded as a net loss of 22 million  

for the year ended december 31 2016  gain on sale of businesses was 966 million  the gain was primarily due to the sales of texas hydraulics thi a custom manufacturer of fluid power components within the engineered systems segment and tipper tie a global supplier of processing and clip packaging machines within the refrigeration  food equipment segment upon disposal of thi and tipper tie we recognized gains on sale of 119 million  and 850 million  respectively 

these disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations 

income taxes 

our businesses span the globe with 362  390  and 338  of our pretax earnings in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively generated in foreign jurisdictions foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 350 us statutory tax rate as of december 31 2017  as a result our effective nonus tax rate is typically significantly lower than the us statutory tax rate effective january 1 2018 the us statutory rate will decrease to 210 

our effective tax rate was 167  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 262  for the year ended december 31 2016  the 2017 and 2016  rates were impacted by 469 million  and 136 million  respectively of favorable net discrete items we recorded a provisional net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 of 509 million  primarily related to the tax reform act the final impact may differ from these provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things issuance of additional regulatory guidance changes in interpretations and assumptions we made and actions we may take as a result of the tax reform act we recorded a 1720 million  benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities arising from a lower us corporate tax rate we also recorded provisional tax expense of 1150 million  related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries we plan to make cash distributions to the us from nonus subsidiaries of up to an estimated 4500 million  and consequently we have recorded 110 million  of anticipated local withholding tax expense associated with these planned distributions the net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 also included a benefit of 49 million related to decreases in statutory tax rates of foreign jurisdictions for the year ended december 31 2016 the discrete items were primarily driven by the adjustment of tax accounts to the us tax return filed   

for the year ended december 31 2015  our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 256 the effective tax rate was impacted by favorable net discrete items totaling 175 million principally related to settlements of uncertain tax matters 

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to   141 million  we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

earnings from continuing operations

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017   decreased   404 million  compared to 2016  this decline was driven primarily by timing of year end revenue increased tax payments of 1676 million  which includes 690 million  of federal and state tax payments for dispositions as well as 95 million  of cash paid for wellsite separation this decline was offset by higher continuing earnings of 1837 million  excluding noncash activity from depreciation and amortization gain on sale of businesses and the impact of the tax reform act 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016   decreased   871 million  compared to 2015  this decline was driven primarily by lower continuing earnings of 1499 million excluding depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of businesses partially offset by improvements in working capital excluding acquisitions and dispositions as well as lower cash outflows for employee incentives and net tax payments 

pension and other postretirement activity  total cash used in conjunction with pension plans during 2017  was 205 million  including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our nonqualified supplemental pension plan 

the funded status of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements due to the overfunded status of this plan the company made no contributions in 2017  2016  and 2015  and expects to make minimal contributions if any in the near term 

our international pension obligations are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2017  2016  and 2015  totaled 80 million  84 million  and 84 million respectively in 2018  we expect to contribute approximately 35 million  to our nonus plans our nonqualified supplemental pension plans are funded through company assets as benefits are paid during 2017  a total of 116 million  benefits were paid under these plans see note 15 — employee benefit plans  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital we believe adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue 



adjusted working capital decreased  from december 31 2016  by 206 million  or 16  to 13 billion  at december 31 2017  which reflected an increase  in receivables of 1204 million  an increase  in inventory of 81 million  and an increase  in accounts payable of 1491 million  excluding acquisitions dispositions and the effects of foreign currency translation adjusted working capital decreased by 68 million or 05 and 399 million or 31 for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

investing activities 

cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash inflows from proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments partially offset by cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

 

 

 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2018  will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper or by accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

 



three years these share repurchases are opportunistic buybacks made as part of managements capital allocation strategy these repurchases are also made to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under our equity compensation plans in 2017 we used 1050 million  to repurchase 11 million   shares under this authorization during 2016 we did not purchase any shares under this program in 2015 we completed the repurchase of 82 million  shares at a total cost of 6002 million  under this authorization as of december 31 2017  the number of shares available for repurchase under the january 2015 share repurchase authorization was 57 million  in february 2018  the companys board of directors approved a new standing share repurchase authorization whereby the company may repurchase up to 20 million  shares of its common stock through december 31 2020  this share repurchase authorization replaces the january 2015 share repurchase authorization which expired on january 9 2018 

 

 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

there were no cash flows from discontinued operations in 2017  and 2016  in 2015  cash used in discontinued operations totaled 1159 million  which reflect the operating results of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace prior to their sale in 2015 as well as 1105 million of taxes paid relating to the gain on the sale of sargent aerospace

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure adjusted free cash flow a nongaap measure which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures plus the add back of cash taxes paid for gains on dispositions which reflect tax payments on dispositionrelated investing activities and cash paid for wellsite separation costs we believe that adjusted free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions paying dividends repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock 

the following table reconciles our adjusted free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2017  we generated adjusted free cash flow of 7034 million  representing 90  of revenue adjusted free cash flow in 2016  was 6976 million  or 103  of revenue and 7948 million  or 114  of revenue in 2015  the full year decrease in 2017  adjusted free cash flow reflects lower cash flow provided by operations as a result of timing of revenue at year end and higher capital expenditures primarily within our fluids segment 

the 2016  decrease in adjusted free cash flow compared to 2015  reflects lower earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization higher capital expenditures and timing of revenue at year end principally in the energy related businesses 

  

capitalization 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock we maintain a 10 billion fiveyear unsecured committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks which expires on november 10 2020  this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin under this facility we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2017  and had a coverage ratio of 114 to 10  we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

on march 15 2018 the outstanding 545 notes with a principal value of 3500 million  will mature these notes have been classified as a current maturity of longterm debt as of december 31 2017  we expect to use a combination of cash and commercial paper to pay off the notes at maturity 

on november 9 2016 we issued €6000 million  of 125 eurodenominated notes due 2026 the proceeds of 6564 million  from the sale of the notes net of discounts and issuance costs were used for payment of a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of wayne 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2017  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 7540 million  of which approximately 6098 million was held outside the united states cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks we regularly hold cash in excess of nearterm requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months as a result of the tax reform act during 2018 we intend to repatriate a significant amount of cash held outside the united states and use the proceeds to pay down commercial paper andor pay off a portion of the 3500 million  notes that will mature on march 15 2018 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders equity the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 391  at december 31 2017  compared to 463  at december 31 2016  the decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by the 4582 million decrease in net debt as a result of 4048 million higher cash and cash equivalents due to the aforementioned cash flow activity the decrease was also impacted by the repayment of commercial paper partially offset by foreign currency translation on our eurodenominated notes 

  

our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 463  at december 31 2016  compared to 396  at december 31 2015  primarily due to changes in net debt during the period net debt increased 8795 million during the period primarily due to an increase in longterm debt outstanding due to the €600 million  notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase in commercial paper borrowings 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2017  



operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 1354 million  outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire at various dates in 2018  through 2039  these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

as of december 31 2017  and during the three year period then ended we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts however we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2017  yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 8574 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries primarily in canada substantially all of the european countries mexico brazil argentina china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges 

additionally the company has designated the €3000 million  and €6000 million  of eurodenominated notes issued december 4 2013 and november 9 2016 respectively as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income loss to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the us dollar the us dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases resulting in the recognition of a loss of 1253 million  and a gain of 538 million  in other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing however such contracts outstanding at december 31 2017  were not significant 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of gaap gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 

revenue   recognition  revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists b price is fixed or determinable c collectability is reasonably assured and d delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we include shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of goods and services 

inventories   inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries including all international subsidiaries are stated at net realizable value determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or cost other domestic inventories are stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates in addition the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 

when performing an impairment test we estimate fair value using the incomebased valuation method under the incomebased valuation method fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rate based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from these estimates the discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates we use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2017  reporting unit valuations ranged from 85  to 100    

we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing of our ten  identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2017  based on the impairment tests performed the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value in most cases by more than 100 and in no case less than 80 as such no goodwill impairment was recognized while we believe the assumptions used in the 2017  impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results if market conditions worsen or persist for an extended period of time an impairment of goodwill or assets may occur we will continue to monitor the longterm outlook and forecasts including estimated future cash flows for these businesses and the impact on the carrying value of goodwill and assets 

employee benefit plans   the valuation of our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates annually we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns economic trends and portfolio allocation our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams the plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting yearbyyear spot rates as disclosed in note 15 — employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements the 2017  weightedaverage discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit ranged from 194  to 365  a decrease from the 2016  rates which ranged from 206  to 410  the lower 2017  discount rates are reflective of decreased market interest rates over this period a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the postretirement benefit obligations by approximately 360 million  from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2017  our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately 18 million  

income taxes   we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies reserves are also estimated using more likely than not criteria for ongoing audits regarding federal state and international issues that are currently unresolved we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings as further described below with respect to us tax law changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized 

upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tax reform act was enacted which significantly changes us tax law by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the tax reform act permanently reduces the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate effective january 1 2018 the tax reform act also provided for a onetime deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits “ep” through the year ended december 31 2017 the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provisions of the tax reform act also require the company to include in its us income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets the company expects that it will be subject to incremental us tax on gilti income beginning in 2018 due to expense allocations required by the us foreign tax credit rules the company has elected to account for gilti tax in the period in which it is incurred and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of gilti in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act we have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the final impact may differ from these provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things additional analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions we made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the tax reform act in accordance with sab 118 the financial reporting impact of the tax reform act will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 

risk retention insurance  we have significant accruals and reserves related to the selfinsured portion of our risk management program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions our experience and relevant industry data we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 

contingencies   we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues while we believe that the amount accrued todate is adequate future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 

restructuring   we establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management or when termination benefits are communicated exit costs include future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations in addition asset impairments may be recorded as a result of an approved restructuring plan the accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

disposed and discontinued operations   from time to time we sell or discontinue or dispose of certain operations for various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations including goodwill to their estimated fair market value these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similartype entities the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates no impairment charges were recorded in 2017  2016  or 2015  

stockbased compensation  we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock units and performance share awards we use the blackscholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars granted 

to employees the model requires that we estimate the expected life of the sar expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data for additional information related to the assumptions used see note 13 — equity and cash incentive program  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

recent accounting standards 

see note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin adjusted free cash flow net debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings cash flows from operating activities debt or equity working capital or revenue as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings which is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level segment ebitda margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and adjusted free cash flow are important measures of liquidity net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ adjusted free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of adjusted free cash flow net debt and net capitalization can be found above in this item 7 mda we believe that reporting adjusted working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on trends in the areas of global energy demand continuous productivity improvement sustainability energy efficiency consumer product safety and growth of consumerism in emerging economies our energy segment is focusing on expansion in high growth regions and technologies accelerating capabilities to drive international growth and increasing investment in innovation to drive customer productivity and cash flow our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing productivity solutions sustainability consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies the fluids segment is focused on accelerated growth within the chemicalplastics retail fueling fluid transfer industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support in particular we are pursuing further growth in the retail fueling hygienic and pharma and polymersplastics markets our refrigeration  food equipment segment is responding to our customers’ energy efficiency and sustainability concerns and unique merchandising requirements with innovative new products 

capturing the benefits of common ownership 

we are committed to operational excellence through our dover excellence dex program this program focuses on free cash flow generation productivity to support ongoing investment in product innovation and customer expansion activities the continuous evaluation of operating efficiencies and the continued consolidation of back office support through this program we have implemented various productivity initiatives such as supply chain management and lean manufacturing to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees we foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization to ensure success our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets we have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in the united states china brazil and india further we continue to make significant investments in talent development recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success 

additionally in 2016 we began to invest in our dover business services dbs shared service centers which will bring significant value to dover by providing important transactional and value added services to our operating companies in the areas of finance information technology and human resources our model allows us to leverage scale across dover increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls ultimately our mission is to serve our operating companies by freeing resources normally dedicated to transactional services to allow those resources to focus on customers markets and product excellence 

disciplined capital allocation 

our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10 to 11 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns to do this we grow and support our existing businesses with average annual investment in capital spending of approximately 2 to 25 of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets develop products and boost productivity businesses in our portfolio are continually evaluated for strategic fit and our acquisitions are targeted in our key growth markets which include printing and identification refrigeration and food equipment pumps and fluid transfer and select energy markets we consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 61 years we will also consider opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy to offset the impact of dilution 

portfolio development 

acquisitions   

our acquisition program has two key elements first we seek to acquire value creating addon businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers or by broadening their product mix second in the right circumstances we will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces 

over the past three years  2014  through 2016  we have spent over 29 billion  to purchase 17  businesses during 2016  we acquired six  businesses for an aggregate consideration of 16 billion  net of cash acquired these businesses include tokheim group sas fairbanks environmental ltd progauge and wayne fueling systems ltd to expand our fluids segments retail fueling portfolio and alliance wireless technologies inc and ravaglioli spa group to complement the industrials platform within our engineered systems segment during 2015 we acquired four  businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 5678 million  net of cash acquired these businesses include gala industries and reduction engineering scheer expanding our fluids segments plastics and polymers product and integrated systems portfolio in addition we acquired jk group a global manufacturer and provider of innovative digital inks for the textile printing market which complements the printing  identification platform within our engineered systems segment during 2014 we acquired seven  businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 8023 million  net of cash acquired including accelerated companies llc expanding our artificial lift footprint within our energy segment for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 — acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3 to 5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal scorecard and defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created 

dispositions   

occasionally we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions or for strategic considerations which include an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces during the past three years  2014  through 2016  we have sold six  businesses for aggregate consideration of 11 billion  

during 2016 we completed the sale of texas hydraulics and tipper tie within the engineered systems and refrigeration  food equipment segments respectively in addition during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the divestiture of the walkin cooler business of hillphoenix within the refrigeration  food equipment segment these disposals did not represent strategic 

shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations we expect to make further dispositions in the future none of which individually are expected to be significant 

during 2015 we completed the sale of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace the financial position and results of operations for the 2015 divestitures have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented for more details see note 3 — disposed and discontinued operations  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

in addition in february 2014 we divested of a significant portion of our technology business with the spinoff of knowles corporation knowles as discussed below 

spinoff of knowles 

on february 28 2014 we completed the separation of knowles from dover through the pro rata distribution of 100 of the common stock of knowles to dovers stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 19 2014 each dover shareholder received one share of knowles common stock for every two shares of dover common stock held as of the record date as a result knowles became an independent publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange and dover retains no ownership interest in knowles the distribution was structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

business segments 

as noted previously we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 16 — segment information  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

energy 

our energy segment serves the drilling  production bearings  compression and automation end markets this segment is a provider of customerdriven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of fuels worldwide this segment consists of the following end markets 

 

 

 

our energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels we manufacture our products primarily in north america and our sales are concentrated in north america with an increasing level of international sales directed primarily to europe australia and asia 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment is focused on the design manufacture and service of critical equipment and components within the printing  identification and industrials platforms as described below 

 

 

our businesses serving the global vehicle service market provide products and services used primarily in vehicle repair and maintenance including light and heavy duty vehicle lifts wheel service equipment vehicle diagnostics and vehicle collision repair solutions products are sold to national dealership networks original equipment manufacturers oem national multishop operations mso groups independent repair and service shops large national accounts and governmenttransit customers through a network of distributors and channel partners 

the businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps power clamps rotary and linear mechanical indexers conveyors pick and place units glove ports and manipulators as well as endofarm robotic grippers slides and end effectors these products serve a very broad market including food processing packaging paper processing medical electronic automotive nuclear and general industrial products 

our businesses serving waste and recycling markets provide products and services for the refuse collection industry and for onsite processing and compaction of trash and recyclable materials products are sold to municipal customers national accounts and independent waste haulers through a network of distributors and directly in certain geographic areas 

engineered systems products are manufactured primarily in the united states and europe and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

fluids 

our fluids segment is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling chemical hygienic oil and gas and industrial end markets  the segment serves two broad global end markets fluid transfer and pumps 

 

 

fluids products are manufactured primarily in the united states europe china and brazil and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food equipment end markets 

 

 

the majority of the refrigerationfood systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the refrigeration  food equipment segment are used by the supermarket industry including “bigbox” retail and convenience stores the commercialindustrial refrigeration industry institutional and commercial food service and food production markets and beverage canmaking industries refrigeration  food equipments products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing can be volatile particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

research and development 

our businesses are encouraged to develop innovative products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2016  we spent 1045 million  for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2015  and 2014  research and development spending totaled 1150 million  and 1184 million  respectively 

our engineered systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the engineered systems segment 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers none of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2016  given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are not significant businesses supplying the waste and recycling agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

seasonality 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the transportation construction waste and recycling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase sequentially through the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

backlog   

backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm contracts primarily for the markets within our fluids and refrigeration  food equipment segments our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of december 31 2016  and 2015  was 11 billion  and 10 billion  respectively 

competition   

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition a summary of our key competitors by end market within each of our segments follows 



international   

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia the middle east and eastern europe 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and with increasing emphasis australia canada china malaysia india mexico brazil eastern europe and the middle east 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the united states as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 16 — segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

sustainability 

in response to our concerns around global sustainability i n 2010 we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities as well as developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes goals objectives and related projects for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to further promote our sustainability efforts we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we are near our goal for reducing overall energy intensity and have surpassed our goal for reducing greenhouse gas intensity we will continue to work proactively to maintain these goals to reduce carbon emissions amidst acquisition and business growth we have also participated as a voluntary respondent in the carbon disclosure project since 2010 and have maintained our scoring range since we began reporting 

all of our segments assess the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the opportunities associated with the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce their energy needs increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

other matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in pass through costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees   

we had approximately 29000  employees as of december 31 2016  

other information 

we make available through the investor information link on our website wwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our website is not incorporated into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

our energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates global economic conditions and related energy demands 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition cash flows and cost of capital 

 

the oil and gas industry historically has experienced periodic downturns including the significant downturn experienced in 2015 and 2016 demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies the level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which have been recently volatile and may continue to be volatile in particular the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and 2015 and declined dramatically prices of oil began to recover in late 2016 but there can be no assurance that increases will continue 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices can reduce or defer major capital expenditures by our customers in the oil and gas industry given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy and pumps products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

approximately 42  of our revenues from continuing operations for 2016  and 39  of our revenues for 2015  were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows which are presented in us dollars for example foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling swiss franc chinese renminbi yuan brazilian real and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

certain of our businesses sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive in these industries they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands if these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws regulations and policies including environmental and employment regulations exportimport laws tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits carbon emission regulations and other similar programs failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment data security data privacy and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates in addition we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance or economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

  

 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations if we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects to cause property damage to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations for example during the fourth quarter of 2016 we determined there was a quality issue with a product component part in the fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the us consumer product safety commission “cpsc” we are finalizing a plan to announce a voluntary recall of the product in conjunction with the cpsc a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures which would reduce operating profit and cash flow in addition a product recall may require significant management attention product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing in addition in connection with the spinoff knowles agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the knowles business we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

our growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives if we are unsuccessful in these efforts our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies 

  

 

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to store and process information and support our business activities we also manufacture and sell hardware and software products and in some cases we also provide services that support customer business activities such as transmitting payment information providing mobile monitoring services and capturing operational data if these technologies systems products or services are damaged cease to function properly are breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or other vulnerabilities or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions including by criminals nation states or insiders we could experience production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential proprietary or otherwise protected information including personal and customer data destruction corruption or theft of data security 

breaches other manipulation disruption misappropriation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability adverse media coverage legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats any of which could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate united states andor nonunited states laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights our businesses employ various measures to develop maintain and protect their intellectual property rights these measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of our businesses intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value a decrease in the longterm economic outlook and future cash flows of our businesses could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets including goodwill charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized although fair values currently exceed carrying values in all of our businesses the value of our businesses within the energy segment were unfavorably impacted by the steep declines in revenue and order rates during the year as drilling and production activity fell due to unfavorable oil prices and lower us rig counts 

 

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2016  although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings if our current credit ratings deteriorate then our borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under our fiveyear credit facility and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

we have a number of collective bargaining units in the united states and various foreign collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity reputation consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act requirement for disclosure of the use of conflict minerals mined in the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries it is possible that some of our businesses customers will require conflict free metals in products purchased from us we are in the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses as required by the doddfrank act the supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors we may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers manufacturing operations and operating profits 

  

the need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts lead to supply shortages or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods

the number type location and size of the properties used by our operations as of december 31 2016  are shown in the following charts by segment 





we believe our owned and leased facilities are wellmaintained and suitable for our operations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

a few of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among potentially responsible parties in each instance the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be relatively insignificant in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other potentially responsible parties involved and it is anticipated to be immaterial to us on a consolidated basis in addition a few of our subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established at december 31 2016  and 2015  we have reserves totaling 300  million and 306  million respectively for environmental and other matters including private party claims for exposure to hazardous substances that are probable and estimable 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the company’s products exposure to hazardous substances patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel at least quarterly review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued todate and the availability and extent of insurance coverage the company has reserves for other legal matters that are probable and estimable and at december 31 2016  and 2015  these reserves are not significant while it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions in the opinion of management based on the aforementioned reviews the company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview and outlook 

dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components specialty systems consumable supplies software and digital solutions and support services through four operating segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment 

for the year ended december 31 2016  consolidated revenue from continuing operations was 68 billion  a decrease  of 02 billion  or 23  as compared to the prior year this decrease included a decline in organic revenue of 54  a 30  impact from dispositions and an unfavorable impact of 10  from foreign currency partially offset by acquisitionrelated growth  of 71  overall customer pricing had a minimal unfavorable impact of 02 on revenue for the year 

our energy segment revenue decreased   3752 million  or 253  from the prior year comprised of an organic revenue decline  of 244  and an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency translation of 09  the decline in organic revenue within our energy segment was largely attributable to a significantly lower us rig count and end customer capital spending compared to the prior year within our engineered systems segment revenue increased   234 million  or 10  from the prior year primarily driven by organic growth  of 17  and acquisitionrelated growth  of 44  partially offset by a 39  impact from a disposition and an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency of 12  organic growth was primarily driven by strong markets in our printing  identification platform our fluids segment revenue increased   3013 million  or 215  comprised primarily of acquisitionrelated growth  of 278  offset by an organic decline  of 51  and an unfavorable  foreign currency impact of 09  the decline in organic revenue impacted both the fluids transfer and pumps end markets as a result of weak longer cycle oil and gas markets and the associated effect of reduced capital spending by our customers within our refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue decreased   1111 million  or 64  from the prior year including a 64   decline  due to dispositions an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency translation of 02  offset by modest organic revenue growth  of 02  

gross profit was 25 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  a decrease  of 962 million  or 37  as compared to the prior year the decrease was primarily a result of the decline in revenue partially offset by supply chain cost containment initiatives and the benefits of prior restructuring actions gross profit margin was 364  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 369  for the prior year for further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results see consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations respectively within mda 

bookings were flat over the prior year at 68 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this result was a 36 decline from organic bookings 31 decline due to dispositions and 08 impact as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates which were offset by 75 increase due to acquisitionrelated bookings bookings declined 237 and 42 within our energy and refrigeration  food equipment segments respectively while bookings in our fluids and engineered systems segments increased 260 and 26 respectively overall our booktobill remained flat from the prior year at 100 backlog as of december 31 2016  was 11 billion  up from 9946 million  from the prior year 

from a geographic perspective our us activity excluding energy was flat yearoveryear on an organic basis including energy our us activity declined due to weakness in oil and gasrelated end markets both european and china activities improved yearoveryear on an organic basis 

during the year we continued to adjust our cost structure to better align with the current economic environment resulting in full year 2016  restructuring charges of 402 million  these actions were concentrated within our energy and fluids segments with charges of 185 million  and 169 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  

for the full year 2016  dover made a total of six  acquisitions for a net cash consideration totaling 16 billion  we completed the acquisition of the dispenser and system businesses of tokheim group sas tokheim in the first quarter of 2016 as well as the acquisitions of fairbanks environmental ltd and progauge in the retail fueling space in the second quarter of 2016 these businesses joined our fluids segment in the third quarter of 2016 we also acquired alliance wireless technologies inc awti in the engineered systems segment during the fourth quarter of 2016  the company completed the acquisitions of ravaglioli spa group rav a provider of automotive service equipment and wayne fueling systems ltd wayne a provider of fuel dispensing payment systems and monitoring and optimization software for retail and commercial fuel stations these acquisitions were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the engineered systems and fluids segments respectively see note 2 — acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further details regarding the businesses acquired during the year 

in addition in 2016  as part of the regular review of our portfolio and the fit of our businesses we completed the divestitures of the texas hydraulics and tipper tie businesses these disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations upon disposal of these businesses we recognized total proceeds for texas hydraulics and tipper tie of 473 million  and 1589 million  which resulted in an aftertax gain on sale of 112 million  and 570 million  respectively see note 3 — disposed and discontinued operations  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information regarding these disposed businesses 

for the year ended december 31 2016  we continued our history of increasing our annual dividend payments to shareholders and paid a total of 2677 million  in dividends to our shareholders 

looking forward 

in 2017  we expect total consolidated revenue growth of 10 to 12 as compared to 2016 this increase will be comprised of growth from acquisitions of approximately 10 organic revenue growth of 3 to 5 partially offset by the impact from dispositions of approximately 1 and a negative impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 we expect all of our segments to contribute to our overall organic growth within the energy segment we are encouraged by the recovery in the north american rig count and oil prices and have developed our full year estimate on an average us rig count of 680 to 700 and an average price per barrel of oil of approximately 55 

we anticipate corporate expense in 2017 to be approximately 125 million up 12 million from current year results primarily reflecting increases in compensation and increased investments as we further implement dover business services dbs across the company 

we expect to generate free cash flow in 2017  of approximately 11 of revenue in total we expect full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations eps to be in the range of 340 to 360 our 2017 guidance includes the impact of disposed businesses the net benefit from restructuring activities and the impact of foreign currency translation 

consolidated results of operations 

  

  nm not meaningful   

revenue 

for the year ended december 31 2016  revenue decreased   1620 million  or 23  to 68 billion  compared with 2015  reflecting an organic decline  of 54  a 30  impact from dispositions and an unfavorable  impact of 10  from foreign currency translation offset by growth  from acquisitions of 71  decline in organic revenue was attributable to weakness in us oil and gasrelated end markets as well as reduced capital spending by our customers acquisition growth of 71  was largely driven by the acquisitions of tokheim and wayne within our fluids segment and rav within our engineered systems segment as well as the fullyear benefit from the fourth quarter 2015 acquisitions overall customer pricing was slightly unfavorable impacting consolidated revenue 02 

for the year ended december 31 2015  revenue decreased   7964 million  or 103  to 70 billion  compared with 2014  reflecting an organic decline  of 98  an unfavorable impact of 39  from foreign currency translation and a decline due to a disposition of 01  offset by acquisitionrelated growth  of 35  acquisition growth was largely driven by the acquisitions of jk group within our engineered systems segment and gala industries and reduction engineering scheer within our fluids segment 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2016  our gross profit decreased   962 million  or 37  to 25 billion  compared with 2015  primarily due to the decline in sales volumes and a product recall charge of 232 million  partially offset by supply chain cost containment initiatives and the benefits of prior restructuring actions gross profit margin declined 50 basis points primarily due to margin declines in our energy segment 

for the year ended december 31 2015  our gross profit decreased   4061 million  or 137  to 26 billion  compared with 2014  primarily due to the significant decline in organic sales volumes especially in our energy segment partially offset by supply chain cost containment initiatives and the benefits of prior restructuring actions gross profit margin declined 150 basis points due to an unfavorable product mix as those businesses with historically higher margin contributions experienced significant revenue declines 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2016  selling general and administrative expenses increased   1101 million  or 67  to 18 billion  compared with 2015  primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization expense acquisitionrelated deal costs and increased headcount the increase is also impacted by increased investment in dbs offset by lower restructuring charges and the benefits of previously implemented cost reduction actions as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased 220 basis points in 2016  to 259  reflecting deleveraging of fixed administrative costs and acquisitionrelated costs on lower revenue 

for the year ended december 31 2015  selling general and administrative expenses decreased   1114 million  or 63  to 16 billion  compared with 2014 reflecting the impact of cost savings realized as the result of restructuring programs and reduced discretionary spending as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased 100 basis points in 2015 to 237 reflecting deleveraging of fixed administrative costs particularly within the energy segment additionally higher restructuring costs of 89 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 also contributed to higher selling general and administrative expenses relative to the revenue base 

nonoperating items 

for the year ended december 31 2016  interest expense net of interest income increased   24 million  or 19  to 1296 million  compared with 2015  due to higher interest rates on higher balances of commercial paper in 2016 as well as the fourth quarter 2016 issuance of the €600 million  of 125 eurodenominated notes this increase was offset in part by the full year impact of lower interest on 4000 million 315 notes which replaced the 3000 million 4875 notes in october 2015 for the year ended december 31 2015  interest expense net of interest income remained relatively flat at 1273 million  compared with 2014 due to higher interest rates on commercial paper year over year offset by lower interest on the eurodenominated debt and on the 4000 million notes issued in october 2015 

during 2016 we completed the sale of texas hydraulics a custom manufacturer of fluid power components within the engineered systems segment and tipper tie a global supplier of processing and clip packaging machines within the refrigeration  food equipment segment these disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and therefore did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations upon disposal of texas hydraulics and tipper tie for the year ended december 31 2016  we recognized a gain on sale of 119 million  and 850 million  respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  other income net of 79 million  71 million  and 59 million  respectively includes earnings on equity method investments of 33 million 33 million and 17 million respectively other income net for 2016  2015  and 2014  also included 29 million 16 million and 21 million respectively of net foreign exchange gains losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances the foreign exchange losses in 2015 and 2014 were more than offset by other nonrecurring items including income due to insurance settlements for property damage of 36 million and 51 million respectively 

income taxes 

our businesses span the globe with 390  338  and 278  of our pretax earnings in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively generated in foreign jurisdictions foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 350 us statutory tax rate as a result our effective nonus tax rate is typically significantly lower than the us statutory tax rate 

our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 262  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 256  for the year ended december 31 2015  the 2016 and 2015  rates were impacted by 136 million  and 175 million  of favorable net discrete items principally resulting from the adjustment of the tax accounts to the us tax return filed and settlements of uncertain tax matters respectively after adjusting for discrete items our effective tax rates were 281  and 278  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to   189 million  some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 289  the effective tax rate was impacted by favorable net discrete items totaling 113 million principally related to settlements of uncertain tax matters after adjusting for discrete and other items the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014  was 299

for the year ended december 31 2015  earnings from continuing operations decreased   1823 million  or 234  to 5959 million  or 374  eps compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7781 million  or 461  eps for the year ended december 31 2014  these results include discrete tax benefits of 175 million  or 011  eps in 2015 and 113 million or 007 eps in 2014 excluding these discrete tax benefits earnings from continuing operations decreased 246 primarily due to lower revenues and additional restructuring charges partially offset by benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives eps decreased in 2015 as a result of lower earnings partially offset by lower weighted average shares outstanding relative to 2014 due to approximately eight million shares repurchased during the year 

  

discontinued operations 

for the year ended december 31 2015  earnings from discontinued operations of 2739 million  primarily includes the gain on sale of 2656 million as a result of the sale of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace and 63 million of earnings attributable to those businesses prior to their disposal these businesses were previously included in the results of the engineered systems segment and were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2014

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016   decreased   871 million  compared to 2015  this decline was driven primarily by lower continuing earnings of 1499 million excluding depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of businesses partially offset by improvements in working capital excluding acquisitions and dispositions as well as lower cash outflows for employee incentives and net tax payments 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015   decreased   11 million  compared to 2014  this slight decline was driven primarily by lower continuing earnings excluding depreciation and amortization of 1624 million and lower compensation and expense accruals of 1141 million offset by higher cash inflows from working capital of 2347 million  relative to the prior year primarily driven by improvements in inventory accounts receivable and accounts payable through active working capital management 

pension and other postretirement activity  total cash used in conjunction with pension plans during 2016 was 257 million  including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our nonqualified supplemental pension plan 

the funded status of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements due to the overfunded status of this plan the company made no contributions in 2016 2015 and 2014 and expects to make minimal contributions if any in the near term 

our significant international pension obligations are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2016  2015  and 2014  totaled 84 million  84 million  and 95 million respectively in 2017  we expect to contribute approximately 65 million  to our nonus plans our nonqualified supplemental pension plan is funded through company assets as benefits are paid during 2016 a total of 166 million  benefits were paid under this plan see note 14 — employee benefit plans  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital we believe adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue adjusted working capital increased  from december 31 2015  by 329 million  or 26  to 13 billion  at december 31 2016  which reflected an increase  in receivables of 1447 million  an increase  in net inventory of 676 million  and an increase  in accounts payable of 1794 million  excluding acquisitions dispositions and the effects of foreign currency translation adjusted working capital decreased by 530 million or 42 due to working capital management 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities are derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

 

 

 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2017  will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper or by accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of sharebased awards the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

in 2015  cash used in discontinued operations totaled 1159 million  compared to cash provided of 60 million  in 2014 these cash flows reflect the operating results of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace prior to their sale in 2015 as well as the results of knowles prior to its spinoff in the first quarter of 2014 cash used in the 2015 period also includes 1105 million of taxes paid relating to the gain on the sale of sargent aerospace cash used in the 2014 period includes costs incurred for the spinoff of knowles of 271 million and capital expenditures of 206 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures as set forth in the consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions paying dividends repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2016  we generated free cash flow of 6968 million  representing 103  of revenue free cash flow in 2015  was 7948 million  or 114  of revenue and 7841 million  or 101  of revenue in 2014  the full year decrease in 2016  free cash flow reflects lower earnings from continuing operations before deprecation and amortization higher capital expenditures and timing of revenue at year end principally in the energy related businesses we expect to generate free cash flow in 2017  of approximately 110 of revenue 

the 2015  increase in free cash flow compared to 2014  reflects productivity operating efficiencies and working capital management through the dover excellence program 

  

capitalization 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock we maintain a 10 billion fiveyear unsecured committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks which expires on november 10 2020  this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our 

commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin under this facility we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2016  and had a coverage ratio of 94 to 10 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

on november 9 2016 we issued €6000 million  of 125 eurodenominated notes due 2026 the proceeds of 6564 million  from the sale of the notes net of discounts and issuance costs were used for payment of a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of wayne 

on september 16 2016 we entered into a 5000 million  unsecured term loan facility the “term loan agreement” with a syndicate of banks we did not draw down on the term loan agreement and on november 14 2016 voluntarily terminated the term loan agreement 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3491 million  of which approximately 2211 million was held outside the united states cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks we regularly hold cash in excess of nearterm requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months 

in 2014 we received a onetime cash dividend of approximately 2350 million as a result of certain restructuring arising from the spinoff of knowles the us tax consequences of this intercompany dividend which were not significant have been included in our total income tax expense cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax payable if some or all of such funds were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability management believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders equity the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 463  at december 31 2016  compared to 396  at december 31 2015  the increase in this ratio was largely driven by changes in net debt during the period net debt increased 8795 million during 

the period primarily due to an increase in longterm debt outstanding due to the €600 million  notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase in commercial paper borrowings 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 396  at december 31 2015  compared to 388  at december 31 2014  primarily due to changes in net debt during the period net debt increased 432 million during the period primarily due to a reduction in cash levels as a result of debt repayments stock repurchases acquisitions and higher longterm debt outstanding due to the 4000 million notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2015 offset by decreased commercial paper borrowings 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2016  



operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 1409 million  outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire at various dates in 2017  through 2021  these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

as of december 31 2016  and during the three year period then ended we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts however we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2016  yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 7840 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries primarily in canada substantially all of the european countries mexico brazil argentina china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges previously we entered into a floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement with a total notional amount of 500 million in exchange for chf 651 million which matured on october 15 2015 this transaction hedged a portion of our net investment in nonus operations the agreement qualified as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value were reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings with any hedge ineffectiveness recognized in current earnings 

additionally the company has designated the €3000 million  and €6000 million  of eurodenominated notes issued december 4 2013 and november 9 2016 respectively as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income loss to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the devaluation of the euro relative to the us dollar the us dollar equivalent of this debt decreased resulting in the recognition of a gain in other comprehensive income of 538 million  and 355 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing however such contracts outstanding at december 31 2016  were not significant 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of gaap gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 

revenue   recognition  revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists b price is fixed or determinable c collectability is reasonably assured and d delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions 

to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we include shipping costs billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of sales 

inventories   inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries including all international subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or market other domestic inventories are stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates in addition the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value our intangible assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 

when performing an impairment test we estimate fair value using the income approach under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rate based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from these estimates the discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates we use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2016 reporting unit valuations ranged from 90 to 105   

we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing of our nine identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2016  based on the impairment tests performed the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value in most cases by more than 100 as such no goodwill impairment was recognized while all of our reporting units passed the goodwill impairment test two of our reporting units within the energy segment had the lowest headroom compared to the other reporting units the aggregate goodwill balance for these two reporting units were 9590 million while there was an overall year over year decline within the energy segment resulting in lower estimated cash flows impacted by lower oil prices and the resulting economic pressures within the oil and gas industry in the second half of 2016 us rig count and oil prices increased sequentially and led to improvement compared to the prior year these two reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values of 49 and 33 an improvement from the prior year while we believe the assumptions used in the 2016 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results if market conditions worsen or persist for an extended period of time an impairment of goodwill or assets may occur we will continue to monitor the longterm outlook and forecasts including estimated future cash flows for these businesses and the impact on the carrying value of goodwill and assets in 2017 

employee benefit plans   the valuation of our pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates annually we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns economic trends and portfolio allocation our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams the plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting yearbyyear spot rates as disclosed in note 14 — employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements the 2016  weightedaverage discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit ranged from 206  to 410  a decrease from the 2015  rates which ranged from 232  to 440  the lower 2016 discount rates are reflective of decreased market interest rates over this period a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately 337 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december 31 2016  our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately 17 million 

income taxes   we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies reserves are also estimated using more likely than not criteria for ongoing audits regarding federal state and international issues that 

are currently unresolved we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

risk retention insurance  we have significant accruals and reserves related to the selfinsured portion of our risk management program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions our experience and relevant industry data we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 

contingencies   we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues while we believe that the amount accrued todate is adequate future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 

restructuring   we establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation when management has committed to an exit or reorganization plan and when termination benefits are probable and can be reasonably estimated based on circumstances at the time the restructuring plan is approved by management exit costs include future minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other contractual terminations in addition asset impairments may be recorded as a result of an approved restructuring plan the accrual of both severance and exit costs requires the use of estimates though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

disposed and discontinued operations   from time to time we sell or discontinue or dispose of certain operations for various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations including goodwill to their estimated fair market value these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similartype entities the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates no impairment charges were recorded in 2016 2015 or 2014 

stockbased compensation  we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock units and performance share awards we use the blackscholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars granted to employees the model requires that we estimate the expected life of the sar expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data for additional information related to the assumptions used see note 12 — equity and cash incentive program  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow net debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital earnings adjusted for nonrecurring items effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities debt or equity earnings revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings which is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level segment ebitda margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of free cash flow net debt and net capitalization can be found above in this item 7 mda we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers we believe that reporting adjusted working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

 item 1 business 

overview 

dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment the companys entrepreneurial business model encourages promotes and fosters deep customer engagement and collaboration which has led to dovers wellestablished and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industryleading product innovation unless the context indicates otherwise references herein to dover the company and words such as we us and our include dover corporation and its subsidiaries dover was incorporated in 1947 in the state of delaware and became a publicly traded company in 1955 dover is headquartered in downers grove illinois and currently employs approximately 26000  people worldwide 

dovers businesses are aligned in four segments and organized around our key end markets focused on growth strategies the segment structure is also designed to provide increased opportunities to leverage dovers scale and capitalize on productivity initiatives dovers four segments are as follows 

 

 

 

 

the following table shows the percentage of total revenue and segment earnings generated by each of our four segments for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



management philosophy 

our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer service growth profitability and return on invested capital our operating structure of four business segments allows for focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of our executive talent our segment and executive management set strategic direction initiatives and goals for our operating companies and also provide oversight allocate and manage capital are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services we foster an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication designed to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness 

in addition we are committed to creating value for our customers employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and the development of products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals 

we have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation focusing on technologies which create tangible value for our customers 

our companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow 

company goals   

we are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives first we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth of 3 to 5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions complemented by acquisition growth second we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives including supply chain activities targeted thoughtful restructuring activities strategic pricing and portfolio shaping third we are committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales greater than 11 through strong performance productivity improvements and active working capital management we support these goals through 1 alignment of management compensation with financial objectives 2 welldefined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 talent development programs 

business strategy 

to achieve our goals we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies 

positioning ourselves for growth 

we have aligned our business segments to focus on the needs of customers in key end markets that are wellpositioned for future growth we capitalize on our expertise while maintaining an intense focus on our customers and their needs we maintain and emphasize our entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve 

in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on trends in the areas of global energy demand continuous productivity improvement sustainability energy efficiency consumer product safety and growth of consumerism in emerging economies for instance our energy segment despite recent market trends is focusing on expansion in high growth regions and technologies accelerating capabilities to drive international growth and increasing investment in innovation to drive customer productivity and cash flow our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including digital conversion productivity solutions sustainability consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies the fluids segment is focused on accelerated growth within the chemicalplastics retail fueling fluid transfer industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support in particular we are pursuing further growth in the hygienic and polymersplastics markets our refrigeration  food equipment segment is responding to our customers’ energy efficiency sustainability and food safety concerns as a result of government regulations with innovative new products in addition we are broadening our product offerings targeted toward retail refrigeration and food service customers with enhanced productivity and merchandising products 

capturing the benefits of common ownership 

we are committed to operational excellence through our dover excellence program this program focuses on free cash flow generation productivity to support the ongoing investment in product innovation and customer expansion activities the continuous evaluation of operating efficiencies and the continued consolidation of back office support through this program we have implemented various productivity initiatives such as supply chain management and lean manufacturing to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees we foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization to ensure success our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets we have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in the us china brazil and india further we continue to make significant investments in talent development recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success 

disciplined capital allocation 

our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 11 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns to do this we grow and support our existing businesses with average annual investment in capital spending approximating 2  25 of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets develop products and boost productivity we continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth markets which include printing and identification refrigeration and food equipment pumps and fluid transfers and select energy markets we consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 60 years we will also continue to repurchase our shares to offset the impact of dilution as a minimum 

portfolio development 

acquisitions   

our acquisition program has two key elements first we seek to acquire value creating addon businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers or by broadening their product mix second in the right circumstances we will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces over the past three years  2013  – 2015  we have spent over 17 billion  to purchase 21  businesses that strategically fit within our business model in the fourth quarter of 2015 we acquired three businesses for an aggregate purchase price of 5613 million these businesses include gala industries and reduction engineering scheer expanding our fluids segments plastics and polymers product and integrated systems portfolio in addition we acquired jk group a global manufacturer and provider of innovative digital inks for the textile printing market that compliments the printing  identification platform within our engineered systems segment in 2014 we acquired accelerated for approximately 4357 million  expanding our artificial lift footprint within our energy segment accelerated now part of our drilling and production businesses is an integrated provider of equipment parts and services for handling fluids in oil and gas production in 2013 we acquired 10 businesses for aggregate consideration of 3228 million including finder pompe which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013 for approximately 1422 million to expand our fluids portfolio 

subsequent to year end we acquired the dispenser and system businesses of tokheim group sas tokheim for a purchase price of approximately €4113 million or 4487 million  tokheim will be integrated with our fluid transfer end market within our fluids segment and will enable us to provide the most complete solutions available for our retail fueling customers 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3  5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal scorecard and defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created 

dispositions   

we routinely review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our longterm strategy occasionally we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations accordingly in an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces during the past three years  2013  – 2015  we have sold five  businesses for aggregate consideration of 9571 million  

during 2015 we completed the sale of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace in addition during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the divestiture of a product line within the refrigeration and food equipment segment we expect to make further dispositions in the future none of which individually are expected to be significant 

the financial position and results of operations for datamax oneil and sargent aerospace have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented for more details see note 3 disposed and discontinued operations  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

in addition in february 2014 we divested of a significant portion of our technology business with the spinoff of knowles as discussed below 

spinoff of knowles 

on february 28 2014 we completed the separation of knowles corporation knowles from dover through the pro rata distribution of 100 of the common stock of knowles to dovers stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 19 2014 each dover shareholder received one share of knowles common stock for every two shares of dover common stock held as of the record date as a result knowles became an independent publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange and dover retains no ownership interest in knowles the distribution was structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

business segments 

as noted previously we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 16 segment information  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

energy 

our energy segment serves the drilling  production bearings  compression and automation end markets this segment is a provider of customer driven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of fuels worldwide this segment consists of the following end markets 

 

 

 

our energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels we manufacture our products primarily in north america and our sales are concentrated in north america with an increasing level of international sales directed primarily to europe australia and asia 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment is focused on the design manufacture and service of critical equipment and components within the printing  identification and industrials platforms as described below 

 6 

safety requirements and growth in emerging markets in addition our businesses serving the textile market are benefiting from a significant shift from analog to digital printing resulting from shorter runs and more complex fashion designs as well as increasing regulatory and environmental standards 

 

the businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps power clamps rotary and linear mechanical indexers conveyors pick and place units glove ports and manipulators as well as endofarm robotic grippers slides and end effectors these products serve a very broad market including food processing packaging paper processing medical electronic automotive nuclear and general industrial products 

our businesses serving waste and recycling markets provide products and services for the refuse collection industry and for onsite processing and compaction of trash and recyclable materials products are sold to municipal customers national accounts and independent waste haulers through a network of distributors and directly in certain geographic areas 

fluids 

our fluids segment is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling chemical hygienic oil and gas and industrial markets the segment serves two broad global end markets fluid transfer and pumps 

 

 

fluids products are manufactured primarily in the united states europe and china and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food service end markets 

 

 

the majority of the refrigerationfood systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the refrigeration  food equipment segment are used by the supermarket industry including “bigbox” retail and convenience stores the commercialindustrial refrigeration industry institutional and commercial food service and food production markets and beverage canmaking industries refrigeration  food equipments products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing can be volatile particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

research and development 

our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2015  we spent 1150  million for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2014  and 2013  research and development spending totaled 1184  million and 1172  million respectively 

our engineered systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the engineered systems segment 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers none one of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2015  given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are quite varied businesses supplying the waste and recycling agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

seasonality 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the transportation construction waste and recycling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

backlog   

backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm contracts primarily for the markets within our fluids and refrigeration  food equipment segments our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was 10 billion  and 12 billion  respectively 

competition   

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition a summary of our key competitors by end market within each of our segments follows 



international   

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia the middle east and eastern europe 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and with increasing emphasis australia canada china malaysia india mexico brazil eastern europe and the middle east 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 16 segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

sustainability 

in response to our concerns around global sustainability i n 2010 we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and have developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to further promote our sustainability efforts we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we have also participated as a voluntary respondent in the carbon disclosure project since 2010 

all of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce their energy needs increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers including but not limited to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

other matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in pass through costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees   

we had approximately 26000  employees as of december 31 2015  

other information 

we make available through the financial reports link on our internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

our energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates global economic conditions and related energy demands 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

 

the oil and gas industry historically has experienced periodic downturns including the significant downturn experienced in 2015 demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies the level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which have been recently volatile and may continue to be volatile in particular the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and 2015 and declined dramatically 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices can reduce or defer major capital expenditures by our customers in the oil and gas industry given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy and pumps products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

approximately 39  of our revenues from continuing operations for 2015  and 40  of our revenues for 2014  were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position 

 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations which are presented in us dollars for example foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 a significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lowercost locations and sold in various countries crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling swiss franc chinese renminbi yuan and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws including environmental and exportimport laws regulations and policies failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment data security data privacy and 

health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates in addition we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance or economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

 

certain of our businesses sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive in these industries they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands if these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated exposed to unexpected liabilities or unable to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations if we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant 

expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing in addition in connection with the spinoff knowles agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the knowles business we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

 

our growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives if we are unsuccessful in these efforts our operating results could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies 

  

 

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer store and support multiple business activities if these systems are damaged cease to function properly or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions we could experience production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy laws as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation 

  

 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value a decrease in the longterm economic outlook and future cash flows of our businesses could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets including goodwill charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the periods recognized although fair values currently exceed carrying values in all of our businesses the value of our businesses within the energy segment were unfavorably impacted by the steep declines in revenue and order rates during the year as drilling and production activity fell due to unfavorable oil prices and lower us rig counts 

 

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2015  although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings if our current credit ratings deteriorate then our borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under our fiveyear credit facility and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act requirement for disclosure of the use of conflict minerals mined in the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries it is possible that some of our businesses customers will require conflict free metals in products purchased from us we are in the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses as required by the doddfrank act the supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors we may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers manufacturing operations and operating profits 

  

the need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts lead to supply shortages or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended december 31 2015  the mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in item 8 of this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in item 1a risk factors and in the special note regarding forwardlooking statements preceding part i of this form 10k 

throughout this mda we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance including a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these include organic revenue organic revenue growth free cash flow and adjusted working capital organic revenue and organic growth refer to revenue and revenue growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending while adjusted working capital refers to accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable we believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends reconciliations within this mda provide more details on the use and derivation of these measures 

the mda is organized as follows 

 

overview and outlook 

dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment 

full year 2015 consolidated revenue from continuing operations was 70 billion a decrease of 7964 million or 103 as compared to the prior year this decrease included a decline in organic revenue of 98 an unfavorable impact of 39 from foreign currency and 01 decline due to a disposed product line partially offset by a 35 increase in acquisitionrelated revenue overall customer pricing had a minimal unfavorable impact of 02 on revenue for the year 

our energy segment revenue decreased 5336 million or 264 from the prior year this decrease included a 343 decline in organic revenue and a 14 decrease due to foreign currency impacts partially offset by 93 of acquisition related growth the decline in organic revenue within our energy segment was largely attributable to the significant deterioration within the oil and gas markets within our engineered systems segment revenue decreased 431 million or 18 from the prior year in spite of this overall decline organic revenue grew 32 and acquisitions contributed 09 growth which was offset by 59 of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates our fluids segment revenue decreased 313 million or 22 comprised of 08 organic revenue growth and 24 revenue growth attributable to acquisitions offset by 54 unfavorability due to foreign currency within our refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue declined 1898 million or 99 from the prior year including declines of 78 in organic revenue 24 related to foreign currency and 04 due to the disposition of a product line  see note 3 disposed and discontinued operations  for additional information partially offset by 07 of acquisition related growth 

gross profit decreased 4061 million  or 137 to 26 billion primarily as a result of the decline in sales partially offset by supply chain cost containment initiatives and the benefits of prior restructuring actions for further discussion related to our 

consolidated and segment results see consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations respectively within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

bookings decreased 123 over the prior year to 68 billion driven primarily by weakness within our energy segment which declined 291 the decrease in full company bookings included a decrease in organic bookings of 118 36 as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a 01 decrease due to dispositions partially offset by a 32 increase in acquisitionrelated bookings bookings across the engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment segments decreased by 57 58 and 78 respectively overall our booktobill was 098 a slight decrease from the prior years booktobill of 100 backlog as of december 31 2015 was 9946 million down from 12 billion from the prior year 

from a geographic perspective revenue declined in north america europe asia and latin america the decrease in north america was primarily driven by the significant deterioration of oil and gas markets and the loss of share with a major food retail customer the decrease in europe and latin america was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates asia was down modestly due to weakness in industrial markets in china 

we acquired four businesses in 2015 for total net consideration of 5678 million these businesses were acquired primarily to complement and expand upon existing operations within our fluids and engineered systems segments in addition in 2015 in conjunction with the regular review of our portfolio and the fit of our businesses we completed the divestitures of the sargent aerospace and datamax oneil businesses which were previously classified as discontinued operations we also completed the divestiture of a product line within our refrigeration  food equipment segment during the fourth quarter of 2015 the operating results of this business remain within our consolidated results for 2015 as the disposal did not qualify to be classified as a discontinued operation 

during 2015 we continued our focus on operating efficiencies through our dover excellence program this program focuses on free cash flow generation productivity to support the ongoing investment in product innovation and customer expansion activities the continuous evaluation of operating efficiencies and the continued consolidation of back office support as a result of the dover excellence program focus we generated free cash flow of 7948 million or 114 of revenue an increase of 107 million and 13 basis points over the prior year in addition the dover excellence programs focus on supply chain initiatives generated approximately 40 million in cost savings during 2015 during the year we also took actions to rightsize our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions especially within our energy segment these actions resulted in full year 2015 restructuring charges of 552 million of which 308 million was within the energy segment the 2016 cost savings expected to be realized as a result of the restructuring programs and other cost management actions initiated in 2015 is expected to be within the range of 400 million to 500 million we expect additional programs may be implemented throughout 2016  with related restructuring charges in the range of 10 to 20 million 

during the year ended december 31 2015 the company purchased a total of approximately 82 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a total cost of 6002 million or approximately 7294 per share these share repurchases were made under the january 2015 share authorization through which the board of directors authorized total repurchases of 15 million shares of the companys common stock as of december 31 2015 the approximate number of shares still available for repurchase under the january 2015 share repurchase authorization was 68 million in 2015 we continued our history of increasing our annual dividend payments to shareholders and paid a total of 2580 million in dividends to our shareholders 

looking forward 

in 2016 we expect revenue growth in our engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment segments we also expect revenue to further decline in energy impacted by continuing deterioration within the oil and gas markets in all we expect 2016 revenue growth of 1 to 4 this growth will be comprised of an organic revenue decline of 1 to 4 growth from acquisitions of approximately 7 and a negative impact from foreign currency of approximately 2 we expect overall growth will be driven by acquisitions primarily within the fluids and engineered systems segments and new product introduction primarily within the engineered systems and refrigeration  food equipment segments within the energy segment north american markets are expected to continue to decline due to reduced rig counts and capital spending resulting from lower oil prices our energy businesss international revenue comprising approximately 24 of segment revenue is expected to remain stable to modestly improving our estimate for energy in 2016 is based on an average annual price per barrel of oil of approximately 40 versus the current market price around 30 

we expect to generate free cash flow in 2016 of approximately 110 of revenue in total we expect full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations eps to be in the range of 385 to 405 our 2016 guidance includes the impact of disposed product lines the benefit of previously executed restructuring actions and share repurchases and the impact of foreign currency translation 

if global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate especially energy markets our operating results for 2016 could be materially different than currently projected 

consolidated results of operations 

as discussed in note 3 disposed and discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k in the fourth quarter of 2014 we reclassified certain businesses in the engineered systems segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses the results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and are presented within results of discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

  nm not meaningful   

revenue 

our 2015  consolidated revenue decreased   7964 million  or 103  to 70 billion  compared to 2014 reflecting an organic decline  of 98  an unfavorable  impact of 39  from foreign currency translation and 01  decline due to a disposed product line offset by growth  from acquisitions of 35  acquisition growth of 35  was largely driven by the recent acquisitions of jk group gala industries and reduction engineering scheer within our engineered systems and fluids segments respectively as well as the fullyear benefit from the october 2014 acquisition of accelerated within the energy segment overall customer pricing was slightly unfavorable impacting consolidated revenue 02 

our 2014  consolidated revenue increased   84  to 78 billion  compared with 2013  reflecting organic growth  of 44  acquisition related growth  of 44  and a slightly unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation all four segments grew solidly yearoveryear acquisition growth of 44 was largely driven by our energy segment with the acquisitions of accelerated and wellmark 

gross profit 

our gross profit decreased   4061 million  or 137  in 2015  compared with 2014  primarily due to the significant decline in sales volumes partially offset by supply chain cost containment initiatives and the benefits of prior restructuring actions gross profit margin declined 150 basis points due to an unfavorable product mix as those businesses with historically higher margin contributions experienced significant revenue declines 

our gross profit increased   1957 million  or 70  in 2014  compared with 2013  reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes gross profit margin declined 40 basis points due to the impact of higher restructuring costs of 144 million higher acquisition related depreciation and amortization of 154 million and higher onetime labor costs as we completed the transition to new production sites 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses decreased   1114 million  or 63  in 2015  compared with 2014  reflecting the impact of cost savings realized as the result of restructuring programs and reduced discretionary spending as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses increased 100 basis points in 2015 to 237  reflecting deleveraging of fixed administrative costs particularly within the energy segment additionally higher restructuring costs of 89 million  as compared to 2014 also contributed to higher selling and administrative expenses relative to the revenue base 

higher selling and administrative expenses in 2014 relative to 2013 reflect general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses increased 10 basis points in 2014 to 227  as compared to 226  for 2013 results for 2014 include a 36 million onetime settlement charge for lumpsum payments made to participants in our us defined benefit pension plan selling and administrative expenses for the 2013 period also include certain onetime gains of 68 million associated with the sale of land in switzerland and pension curtailment gain of 44 million recognized in connection with the freeze of future service benefits for the us benefit plans adjusting for these onetime items selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 20 basis points in 2014 relative to 2013 as a result of leverage from higher revenue levels which more than offset higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization and increased restructuring charges 

nonoperating items 

interest expense net remained relatively flat at 1273 million  in 2015  due to higher interest rates on commercial paper year over year offset by lower interest on the eurodenominated debt and on the 4000 million notes issued during the fourth quarter in 2014  our interest expense net increased   54  to 1272 million  due primarily to higher interest rates on the eurodenominated debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2013 

other expense income net in 2015  2014  and 2013  includes 16 million 21 million and 56 million respectively of net foreign exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances these foreign exchange losses were more than offset by other nonrecurring items including income due to insurance settlements for property damage of 36 million 51 million and 74 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively other income for 2015 and 2014 also included 33 million and 17 million respectively for earnings on equity method investments during the year 

income taxes 

our businesses span the globe with 338  278  and 317  of our pretax earnings in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively generated in foreign jurisdictions foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 350 us statutory rate we also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions as a result our effective nonus tax rate is typically significantly lower than the us statutory rate 

the 2015  effective tax rate on continuing operations was 256  compared to the 2014  rate of 289  the 2015 and 2014  rates were impacted by 175 million  and 113 million  of favorable net discrete items principally related to settlements of uncertain tax matters after adjusting for discrete items the effective tax rates were 278  for 2015  and 299  for 2014  our 2015 tax rate was lower than the prior year due to the mix of earnings driven principally by reduced us earnings within our energy segment 

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to   180 million  some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

the 2013  effective tax rate on continuing operations was 238  the effective tax rate in 2013  was impacted by favorable net discrete items totaling 755 million principally related to the conclusion of certain us federal state and international tax audits a favorable court opinion certain crossborder tax consequences and the effect of the american tax relief act of 2012 which was enacted on january 2 2013 after adjusting for discrete and other items the effective tax rate for 2013  was 310 

earnings from continuing operations 

earnings from continuing operations decreased   234  to 5959 million  or 374  eps in 2015  compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7781 million  or 461  eps in 2014  these results include discrete tax benefits of 175 million  or 011  eps in 2015  and 113 million  or 007  eps in 2014  excluding these tax benefits earnings from continuing operations decreased 246  in 2015 primarily due to lower revenues and additional restructuring charges partially offset by benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives eps decreased  in 2015 as a result of lower earnings partially offset by lower weighted average shares outstanding relative to 2014 due to approximately eight million shares repurchased during the year 

earnings from continuing operations decreased   24  in 2014  compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7975 million  or 460  eps in 2013  these results include discrete tax benefits of 113 million  in 2014 and 755 million or 043 eps in 2013 excluding these tax benefits earnings from continuing operations increased 62 primarily due to higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives offset by higher restructuring and acquisitionrelated expenses eps increased in 2014 reflecting the impact of higher earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding relative to 2013 due to over seven million shares repurchased during the year 

  

discontinued operations 

the results of discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily include the gain on sale of 2656 million as a result of the sale of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace and 63 million of earnings attributable to those businesses prior to their disposal these businesses were previously included in the results of the engineered systems segment and were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2014 

the results of discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2014 totaled a net loss of 29 million this amount includes a loss on the sale of dek of 69 million  and a gain of 32 million  in connection with a working capital adjustment for ect which was sold in 2013 also reflected within the net loss from discontinued operations is 323 million of aftertax earnings for those businesses classified as discontinued operations including datamax oneil and sargent aerospace 271 million of spinoff costs and a pension settlement charge of 44 million  net of tax attributable to lump sum payments made to knowles participants in dovers qualified defined benefit pension plan 

  

earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2056 million which primarily reflects aftertax earnings of the five businesses classified as discontinued operations as well as discrete tax benefits of 548 million 301 million of spinoff costs and 183 million of interest on tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions also reflected in discontinued operations is a net loss on the sale of ect including impairments of 215 million and 140 million of impairment relating to dek

restructuring activities 

2015  restructuring activities 

the company incurred 552 million  of restructuring charges during 2015  including the programs described below 

 

 

 

 

we anticipate that much of the benefit of these 2015  programs will be realized in 2016  and into 2017 we also expect to fund the remainder of the 2015  programs currently underway over the next 12 to 18 months in light of the economic uncertainty in certain of our end markets and our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2016  

2014  restructuring activities 

the company incurred 448 million  of restructuring charges during 2014  including the programs described below 

 

 

 

 

 

restructuring initiatives in 2013  were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations and headcount reductions we incurred restructuring charges of 91 million  relating to such activities see note 8 restructuring activities  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional details regarding our recent restructuring activities 

segment results of operations 

  

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets see note 16 segment information  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a reconciliation of segment revenue earnings and operating margin to our consolidated revenue earnings from continuing operations and operating margin segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

energy 

our energy segment serving the drilling  production bearings  compression and automation end markets is a provider of customerdriven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of fuels worldwide and has a strong presence in the bearings and compression components and automation markets 

  

2015  versus 2014   

revenue generated by our energy segment decreased   5336 million  or 264  as compared with 2014  composed of an organic revenue decline  of 343  and an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency translation of 14  offset by 93  acquisitionrelated growth  t his decline in revenue was the result of significantly lower demand from our customers as a result of the 

dramatic decrease in the price of oil during 2015 and a decline of approximately 47 in the year over year average number of active drilling rigs in the us the impact of strategic customer price reductions on revenue was approximately 17 in 2015 

 

 

 

segment earnings decreased   2886 million  or 625  for our energy segment as compared to the prior year primarily driven by lower volume for our businesses serving the drilling  production end market as well as higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization of approximately 101 million over the prior year in addition restructuring charges increased 233 million over the prior year as the segment continued targeted workforce reductions and field service consolidations 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2015   decreased   291  compared to 2014  reflecting ongoing market weakness backlog at december 31 2015   decreased   333  compared to the prior year due to decreased demand in all three end markets primarily due to lower oil prices segment booktobill was 096  

2014  versus 2013 

energy segment revenue for the year increased   1634 million  an 88  increase over the prior year including organic growth  of 31  acquisitionrelated growth  of 66  slightly offset by an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency translation of 09  customer pricing was neutral when comparing 2014 to the prior year 

 

 

 

energy earnings in 2014  increased 22 million  compared to 2013  or 05  primarily due to higher drilling and automation revenue partially offset by higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization of approximately 220 million as well as higher restructuring costs of 84 million the operating margin decrease of 190 basis points was also partially impacted by unfavorable material pricing in the artificial lift businesses 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment is comprised of two platforms printing  identification and industrials and is focused on the design manufacture and service of critical equipment and components serving the fastmoving consumer goods digital textile printing vehicle service environmental solutions and industrials end markets 



2015  versus 2014   

engineered systems revenue for 2015  decreased 431 million  or 18  as compared to 2014  primarily driven by an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency of 59  partially offset by organic growth  of 32  and acquisitionrelated growth  of 09  the engineered systems segment derived 45 of its revenues outside the us in 2015 primarily within europe a significant portion of the segments sales were impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and other global currencies in 2015 customer pricing did not have a significant impact on the segment in 2015 

 

 

engineered systems segment earnings in 2015   decreased   100 million  or 26  compared with 2014  increased volume as a result of organic growth was more than offset by the significant unfavorable impact from foreign currency and higher restructuring charges of 67 million operating margin remained flat with the prior year reflecting productivity gains and the benefits from completed restructuring initiatives 

bookings for our industrials platform decreased   57  due to a decline in organic growth and foreign currency translation our printing  identification bookings decreased   56  due to the impact of foreign currency translation offset by recent acquisitions and organic growth segment booktobill was 098  

2014  versus 2013 

engineered systems 2014  revenue increased   2080 million  or 95  including organic revenue growth  of 62  and growth from recent acquisitions of 41  partially offset by an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency translation of 08  customer pricing did not have a significant impact on engineered systems revenue in 2014 as compared to 2013 

 

 

engineered systems segment earnings in 2014   increased   395 million  or 114  compared with 2013  as a result of increased volume and productivity improvements and recent acquisitions operating margin increased 20 basis points compared to 2013  as productivity savings were partially offset by higher acquisitionrelated costs including 65 million of depreciation and amortization as well as higher restructuring costs of 30 million

our fluids segment serving the fluid transfer and pumps end markets is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling chemical hygienic oil and gas and industrial end markets 



2015  versus 2014   

fluids segment revenue decreased   313 million  or 22  compared to 2014  comprised of an unfavorable  foreign currency impact of 54  offset by organic growth  of 08  and acquisitionrelated growth  of 24  fluids segment revenue experienced some favorability in 2015 as a result of strategic customer pricing offset by pricing pressure in polymer pumps and pressures within the oil and gas markets 

 

 

fluids segment earnings increased   105 million  or 42  for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year period driven by the benefits of completed restructuring and productivity actions operating margin expanded 110 basis points in spite of an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to recent acquisitions higher restructuring charges as compared to the prior year period deal related expenses and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency 

bookings for 2015   decreased   58  as compared to 2014  and backlog levels decreased   124  at december 31 2015  compared to the prior year end primarily reflecting the timing of projectrelated orders within pumps book to bill was 097

fluids segment revenue increased   1937 million  or 157  compared to 2013  comprised of organic revenue growth  of 75  acquisitionrelated growth  of 83  partially offset by an unfavorable  foreign currency impact of 01  customer pricing provided favorability due in 2014 as compared to 2013 

 

 

fluids segment earnings increased   271 million  or 121  in 2014  compared to 2013  as volume leverage productivity initiatives and strategic pricing more than offset incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions including approximately 107 million of depreciation and amortization operating margin decreased 60 basis points primarily due to the aforementioned impact of recent acquisitions as well as higher restructuring charges to better streamline businesses particularly within the businesses serving the pumps end market 

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food service end markets 



2015  versus 2014   

refrigeration  food equipment segment revenue decreased   1898 million  or 99  compared to 2014  comprised of an organic revenue decline  of 78  an unfavorable  impact from foreign currency translation of 24  and a 04   decline  due to dispositions the decline was slightly offset by acquisitionrelated growth  of 07  customer pricing did not have a significant impact on the segments revenue in 2015 

 refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings decreased   174 million  or 73  for the year ended december 31 2015    compared to the prior year period primarily due to volume declines partially offset by the benefits of restructuring programs and productivity initiatives operating margin increased 40 basis points reflecting the benefits of restructuring programs and reduced supply chain and manufacturing costs as well as lower restructuring charges in 2015 as compared to the prior year 

results of operations for the refrigeration  food equipment segment include a product line that was disposed in the fourth quarter of 2015 the disposal of this product line reduced segment revenue by 04 in 2015 the segment recognized a minimal gain on sale upon disposal of this product line 

bookings for 2015   decreased   78  as compared to 2014  and backlog levels decreased   124  at december 31 2015  compared to the prior year end principally reflecting the reduction of orders from a major food retailer as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation book to bill was 099

refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings in 2014   decreased   286 million  or 107  compared with 2013  with a decrease in operating margin of 180 basis points the earnings and margin decreases were driven by nonrecurring restructuring of 249 million 194 million higher as compared to 2013 primarily for the closure of a europeanbased facility unfavorable product mix as well as a 68 million land sale gain in the prior year that did not repeat 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2015   decreased   11 million  relative to 2014  this slight decline was driven primarily by lower continuing earnings excluding depreciation and amortization of 1624 million and lower compensation and expense accruals of 1141 million offset by higher cash inflows from working capital of 2347 million  relative to the prior year primarily driven by improvements in inventory accounts receivable and accounts payable through active working capital management 

cash provided by operating activities in 2014   decreased   294 million  relative to 2013  this decline was driven by higher investments in working capital of 434 million  in 2014  relative to the prior year primarily due to the impact of timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments in addition higher tax payments of approximately 540 million  contributed to the decline in operating cash flow in 2014  these reductions were partially offset by higher continuing earnings before the impact of depreciation amortization and restructuring expenses and lower pension contributions of 160 million  

pension and postretirement activity  total contributions to defined benefit pension plans during 2015 were 219 million including contributions to our international pension plans and payments of benefits under our nonqualified supplemental pension plan 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to the us qualified benefit plans totaled 90 million in 2013  due to the overfunded status of this plan the company made no contributions in 2015 and 2014 and expects to make minimal contributions in the near term 

our significant international pension obligations are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2015  2014  and 2013  totaled 84 million  95 million  and 98 million respectively in 2016  we expect to contribute approximately 63 million  to our nonus plans our nonqualified supplemental pension plan is funded through company assets as benefits are paid during 2015 a total of 128 million benefits were paid under this plan see note 14 employee benefit plans  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital in 2015  adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable decreased  from 2014  by 1626 million  or 113  to 13 billion  which reflected a decrease  in receivables of 663 million  a decrease  in net inventory of 608 million  and an increase  in accounts payable of 355 million  excluding acquisitions dispositions and the effects of foreign exchange translation adjusted working capital decreased by 1476 million or 103 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities are derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

 

 

 

on january 7 2016 we acquired the dispenser and system businesses of tokheim group sas tokheim for a purchase price of approximately €4113 million  or 4487 million of the total purchase price €2900 million approximately 3164 million was funded through incremental borrowings of commercial paper with the remainder funded through available cash on hand 

  

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2016  will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper the use of established lines of credit or by accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

 

 40 

 

 

 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

cash used in discontinued operations totaled 1159 million  in 2015  as compared to cash provided of 60 million  in 2014  these cash flows reflect the operating results of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace prior to their sale in 2015 as well as the results of knowles prior to its spinoff in the first quarter of 2014 cash used in the 2015 period also includes 1105 million of taxes paid relating to the gain on the sale of sargent aerospace cash used in the 2014 period includes costs incurred for the spinoff of knowles of 271 million and capital expenditures of 206 million 

in 2013  cash provided by discontinued operations of 658 million  included full year results for those business classified as discontinued operations which include knowles dek ect sargent aerospace and datamax oneil the cash generated from operations was offset by costs incurred for the spinoff of knowles of 301 million and capital expenditures of 1016 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt pay dividends fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2015  we generated free cash flow of 7948 million  representing 114  of revenue free cash flow in 2014  was 7841 million  or 101  of revenue and 8379 million  or 117  of revenue in 2013  the full year increase in 2015  free cash flow reflects our efforts around operating efficiencies and working capital management through our dover excellence program we expect to generate free cash flow in 2016  of approximately 110 of revenue 

the 2014  decrease in free cash flow compared to 2013  reflects a higher investment in working capital and higher capital expenditures partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization 

  

net debt to net capitalization 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 398  at december 31 2015  compared to 388  at december 31 2014  the increase in this ratio was driven by changes in net debt during the period net debt increased 569 million during the period primarily due to a reduction in cash levels as a result of debt repayments stock repurchases and acquisitions and higher longterm debt outstanding due to the 4000 million notes issued in the fourth quarter offset by decreased commercial paper borrowings 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december 31 2014  compared to the prior yearend primarily due to the reduction in our net capitalization of 13 billion for the period primarily due to the 14 billion distribution of knowles 6011 million in share repurchases and 2585 million of dividends offset by 7752 million of current earnings as described above we also received a cash payment of 3600 million from knowles net of cash distributed upon separation on february 28 2014 which was used to fund share repurchases and reduce commercial paper balances net debt increased 3248 million during the period primarily due to increases in commercial paper balances and a reduction in cash levels to fund acquisitions dividend payments and other general operating purposes 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock on november 10 2015 we entered into a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that replaced a facility with similar terms that was set to expire on november 16 2016 the new facility will expire on november 10 2020 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a canadian dollar eurodollar swedish kroner or sterling rate based on cdor euribor libor or stibor plus an applicable margin ranging from 0580 to 1000 subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by sp and moody’s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility under this facility we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2015  and had a coverage ratio of 133 to 10 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2015  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3622 million  of which approximately 1961 million was held outside the united states cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade money market instruments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less we regularly invest cash in excess of nearterm requirements in money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months 

in 2014 we received a onetime cash dividend of approximately 2350 million as a result of certain restructuring arising from the spinoff of knowles the us tax consequences of this intercompany dividend which were not significant have been included in our total income tax expense cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax payable if some or all of such funds were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability management believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the us 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2015  



shortterm ratings of p1 a1 and f1 are defined as a strong or superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations a longterm rating of a or a2 is defined as a strong capacity to meet financial commitments but susceptible to adverse business or economic conditions 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 1162 million  outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire at various dates in 2016  through 2020  these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2015  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

as of december 31 2015  and during the three year period then ended we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts however we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2015  yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2269 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries primarily in canada mexico substantially all of the european countries brazil argentina china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges previously we entered into a floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement with a total notional amount of 500 million in exchange for chf 651 million which matured on october 15 2015 this transaction hedged a portion of our net investment in nonus operations the agreement qualified as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value were reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings with any hedge ineffectiveness recognized in current earnings the fair value of this hedge reflected cumulative losses of 156 million  at december 31 2014 reflecting the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement at maturity on october 15 2015 the company settled the outstanding liability on this swap agreement for a total of 178 million 

additionally the company has designated the €3000 million  of eurodenominated notes issued december 4 2013 as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the devaluation of the euro relative to the us dollar in the latter half of 2014 and through 2015 the us dollar equivalent of this debt decreased resulting in the recognition of a gain in other comprehensive income of 355 million  and 476 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing however such contracts outstanding at december 31 2015  were not significant 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of gaap gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 

 45 

upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements 

 

 

when performing an impairment test we estimate fair value using the income approach under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rate based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from these estimates the discount rates used in these analyses vary by reporting unit and are based on a capital asset pricing model and published relevant industry rates we use discount rates commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent to each reporting unit and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2015 reporting unit valuations ranged from 95 to 110   

we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing of our nine identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2015  based on the impairment tests performed the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value in most cases by more than 100 as such no goodwill impairment was recognized while all of our reporting units passed the goodwill impairment test we noted a decrease in the amount of fair value in excess of carrying value for two of our reporting units within the energy segment which together have an aggregate goodwill balance of 9570 million these businesses and their estimated cash flows have been impacted by declining oil prices and the resulting economic pressures within the oil and gas industry in spite of these declines these two reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values of 26 and 19 should market conditions worsen or persist for an extended period of time an impairment may occur we will continue to monitor the longterm outlook and forecasts including estimated future cash flows for these businesses in 2016

assets a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately 17 million

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be entirely classified as noncurrent within the statement of financial position we early adopted this guidance as of december 31 2015 and applied its provisions retrospectively to all periods presented upon adoption we reclassified 28 million of current deferred tax assets from deferred tax assets to other assets and deferred charges 605 million of current deferred tax assets from “deferred tax assets” to “deferred income taxes” and 09 million of current tax liabilities from “federal and other income taxes” to “deferred income taxes” as of december 31 2014 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow net debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital earnings adjusted for nonrecurring items effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities debt or equity earnings revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings segment margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of free cash flow total debt and net debt can be found above in this item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers we believe that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes given the global nature of our businesses we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

 item 1 business 

overview 

dover corporation is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment the companys entrepreneurial business model encourages promotes and fosters deep customer engagement and collaboration which has led to dovers wellestablished and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industryleading product innovation unless the context indicates otherwise references herein to dover the company and words such as we us and our include dover corporation and its subsidiaries dover was incorporated in 1947 in the state of delaware and became a publicly traded company in 1955 dover is headquartered in downers grove illinois and currently employs approximately 27000  people worldwide within its continuing operations 

on february 28 2014 the company completed the separation of knowles corporation knowles from dover through the pro rata distribution of 100 of the common stock of knowles to dovers stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 19 2014 each dover shareholder received one share of knowles common stock for every two shares of dover common stock held as of the record date as a result knowles became an independent publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange and dover retains no ownership interest in knowles the distribution was structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

in the first quarter of 2014 dover announced the realignment of its businesses into a new segment structure consisting of four segments and organized around its key end markets to better focus on growth strategies the new structure is designed also to provide increased opportunities to leverage dovers scale and capitalize on productivity initiatives dovers four segments are as follows 

 

 

 

 

the following table shows the percentage of total revenue and segment earnings generated by each of our four segments for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



management philosophy 

our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer service growth profitability and return on invested capital our operating structure of four business segments and two platforms allows for focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of our executive talent our segment and executive management set strategic direction initiatives and goals provide oversight allocate and manage capital are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services we foster an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness 

in addition we are committed to creating value for our customers employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and developing products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals we have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation focusing on technologies which create tangible value for our customers 

our companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow 

company goals   

we are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives first we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth over the midterm of 2 to 4 complemented by acquisition growth secondly we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives including supply chain activities strategic pricing and portfolio shaping lastly we are committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales greater than 10 through disciplined capital allocation strong performance productivity improvements and active working capital management we support these goals through 1 alignment of management compensation with financial objectives 2 welldefined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 talent development programs 

business strategy 

to achieve our goals we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies 

positioning ourselves for growth 

we have aligned our business segments to focus on the needs of customers in keyend markets that are wellpositioned for future growth in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on growth trends in the areas of global energy demand sustainability consumer product safety and emerging economies for instance our energy segment is positioned to continue expansion in high growth spaces accelerate capabilities to drive international growth and increase investment in innovation and technology to drive customer productivity and cash flow our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies the fluids segment is focused on accelerated growth within the chemicalplastics retail fueling fluid transfer industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support our refrigeration  food equipment segment is responding to energy efficiency sustainability and food safety as a result of government regulations principally in the us and europe 

capturing the benefits of common ownership 

we are committed to operational excellence and have implemented various productivity initiatives such as supply chain management lean manufacturing and facility consolidations to maximize our efficiency coupled with workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees we foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization to ensure success our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets we have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in the us china brazil and india further we continue to make significant investments in talent development recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success 

disciplined capital allocation 

our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns to do this we grow and support our existing businesses with annual investment in capital spending approximating 2  25 of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets develop products and boost productivity we continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth spaces energy product id industrials refrigeration and food equipment and fluid solutions we consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 59 years we will also continue to repurchase our shares consistent with our previously announced share repurchase programs 

portfolio development 

acquisitions   

our acquisition program has two key elements first we seek to acquire value creating addon businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers or by broadening their product mix second in the right circumstances we will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces over the past three years  2012  – 2014  we have spent over 22 billion  to purchase 24  businesses that strategically fit within our business model in the fourth quarter of 2014 we acquired accelerated companies for approximately 4357 million  accelerated is an integrated provider of equipment parts and services for handling fluids associated with oil and gas production and expands our artificial lift footprint within our energy segment in 2013 we acquired 10 businesses for an aggregate consideration of 3228 million  including finder pompe which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013 for approximately 1422 million to expand our fluids segment in 2012 we spent approximately 6032 million to acquire anthony international a leading manufacturer of specialty glass commercial glass refrigerator and freezer doors lighting systems and display equipment the acquisition of anthony expands our portfolio of industryleading technology in the refrigeration space and provides access to new geographies and new markets most notably the convenience store market recent significant acquisitions have also included maag pump systems a european acquisition for our fluids segment which we acquired in the first quarter of 2012 for approximately 2658 million and production control services acquired in the second quarter of 2012 for consideration totaling 2200 million which added to our artificial lift technology in our energy segment 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 3 acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 2  5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal tool kit and defined processes to help ensure synergies are realized and value is created as had been planned when the acquisition was made 

dispositions   

we continually review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our longterm strategy occasionally we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations accordingly in an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces during the past three years  2012  – 2014  we have sold two  businesses for aggregate consideration of 2678 million  in addition to the knowles spinoff as discussed below furthermore the company has classified datamax oneil and sargent aerospace as held for sale as of december 31 2014 and expects to complete the sale of these businesses in the first and second quarters of 2015 respectively 

the financial position and results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented for more details see note 4 disposed and discontinued operations  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

spinoff of knowles 

on february 28 2014 the company completed the separation of knowles corporation knowles from dover through the pro rata distribution of 100 of the common stock of knowles to dovers stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 19 2014 each dover shareholder received one share of knowles common stock for every two shares of dover common stock held as of the record date as a result knowles became an independent publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange and dover retains no ownership interest in knowles the distribution was structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes following the spinoff of knowles dover realigned its segment structure to ensure it is properly organized to execute its future growth plans 

business segments 

as noted previously we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 17 segment information  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

energy 

our energy segment serves the drilling  production bearings  compression and automation end markets this segment is a provider of customer driven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of oil natural gas liquids and gas worldwide this segment consists of the following lines of business 

 

 

 

our energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels we manufacture our products primarily in north america and our sales are concentrated in north america with an increasing level of international sales directed largely to europe australia and asia 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment is focused on the design manufacture and service of critical equipment and components serving the printing  identification vehicle service waste handling and select niche industrial end markets to better serve its end markets the segment manages its products and services through two core business platforms printing  identification and industrials as described below 

 6 

such as date codes and serial numbers on fast moving consumer goods capitalizing on expanding food and product safety requirements and growth in emerging markets in addition our business serving the textile market is benefiting from a significant shift from analog to digital printing resulting from shorter runs and more complex fashion designs as well as increasing regulatory and environmental standards 

 

the businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps power clamps rotary and linear mechanical indexers conveyors pick and place units glove ports and manipulators as well as endofarm robotic grippers slides and end effectors these products serve a very broad market including food processing packaging paper processing medical electronic automotive nuclear and general industrial products 

our businesses serving waste and recycling markets provide products and services for the refuse collection industry and for onsite processing and compaction of trash and recyclable materials products are sold to municipal customers national accounts and independent waste haulers through a network of distributors and directly in certain geographic areas 

fluids 

our fluids segment is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling chemical hygienic and industrial markets the segment serves two broad global end markets fluid transfer and pumps 

 

 

fluids products are manufactured primarily in the united states europe and china and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food service industries 

 

 

the majority of the refrigerationfood systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the refrigeration  food equipment platforms are used by the supermarket industry “bigbox” retail and convenience stores the commercialindustrial refrigeration industry institutional and commercial foodservice and food production markets and beverage canmaking 

industries refrigeration  food equipments products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

research and development 

our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2014  we spent 1184  million for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2013  and 2012  research and development spending totaled 1172  million and 1236  million respectively 

our engineered systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the engineered systems segment 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

seasonality 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the transportation construction waste and recycling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2014  given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are quite varied businesses supplying the waste and recycling 

agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

backlog   

backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm contracts primarily for the refrigeration and food equipment markets of our refrigeration  food equipment segment our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of december 31 2014  and 2013  was 12 billion  for both periods 

competition   

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition a summary of our key competitors by end market within each our segments follows 



international   

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia the middle east and eastern europe 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and with increasing emphasis australia canada china malaysia india mexico brazil eastern europe and the middle east 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in item 1a risk factors for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 17 segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

in 2010 we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and have developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we also participated as a respondent in the 2013 carbon disclosure project 

all of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers including but not limited to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in pass through costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees   

we had approximately 27000  employees in our ongoing operations as of december 31 2014  

other information 

we make available through the financial reports link on our internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

our energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates global economic conditions and related energy demands 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

 

the oil and gas industry historically has experienced periodic downturns demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies the level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which have been recently volatile and may continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices can reduce or defer major capital expenditures by our customers in the oil and gas industry given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

approximately 40  of our revenues from continuing operations for 2014  and 41  of our revenues for 2013  were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

customer requirements and new regulations may increase our expenses and impact the availability of certain raw materials which could adversely affect our revenue and operating profits 

our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act requirement for disclosure of the use of conflict minerals mined in the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries it is possible that some of our businesses customers will require conflict free metals in products purchased from us we are in the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses as required by the doddfrank act the supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors we may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers manufacturing operations and operating profits 

  

the need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts lead to supply shortages or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods 

 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws including environmental and exportimport laws regulations and policies failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment data security data privacy and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates in addition we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

  

 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

certain of our businesses sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive in these industries they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands if these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated exposed to unexpected liabilities and unable to to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations if we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities similarly the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

 

there can be no assurance that the contemplated dispositions will be completed on the anticipated terms or timeframe or at all 

  

 

our growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives if we are unsuccessful in these efforts our operating results could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies 

  

 

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer store and support multiple business activities if these systems are damaged cease to function properly or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions we could experience production downtimes 

operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy laws as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation 

  

 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations which are presented in us dollars a significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lowercost locations and sold in various countries crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling swiss franc chinese renminbi yuan and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our longterm debt as of december 31 2014  although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings if our current credit ratings deteriorate then our borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under our fiveyear credit facility and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantively to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares to our shareholders will qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code to preserve the taxfree treatment of the distribution of shares to our shareholders we will be subject to restrictions with respect to our activities including restrictions relating to certain issuances or repurchases of our common stock asset sales mergers and liquidations 

these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might increase the value of our business these restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock especially if our stock price were to suffer substantial declines or through the sale of certain of our assets 

 

in connection with the spinoff knowles agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the knowles business there can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations the failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended december 31 2014  the mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in item 8 of this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in item 1a risk factors and in the special note regarding forwardlooking statements preceding part i of this form 10k 

throughout this mda we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance including a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these include organic revenue organic revenue growth free cash flow and adjusted working capital organic revenue and organic growth refer to revenue and revenue growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending while adjusted working capital refers to accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable we believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends reconciliations within this mda provide more details on the use and derivation of these measures 

the mda is organized as follows 

 

overview and outlook 

dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment 

on february 28 2014 the company completed the separation of knowles from dover through the pro rata distribution of 100 of the common stock of knowles to dovers stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 19 2014 the distribution was structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

in the first quarter of 2014 dover announced the realignment of its businesses into a new segment structure consisting of four segments and organized around its key end markets to better focus on growth strategies the new structure is designed also to provide increased opportunities to leverage dovers scale and capitalize on productivity initiatives 

in connection with managements evaluation of dovers businesses for their strategic fit within dovers operations the company announced in the fourth quarter of 2014 its intention to divest datamax oneil and sargent aerospace two businesses within the engineered systems segment accordingly these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations the company has reached a definitive agreement to sell datamax oneil also excluded from continuing operations are the results of operations of dek international and everett charles technologies including the multitest business collectively ect until their respective dates of sale of third quarter 2014 and fourth quarter 2013 respectively the company completed the sale of dek international in the third quarter of 2014 for total proceeds of 1706 million which resulted in an aftertax loss on sale of 69 million in addition the company recognized a gain on sale of 32 million in 2014 in connection with a working capital adjustment of 45 million for ect the results presented herein represent continuing operations excluding the results of these businesses as well as the results of knowles prior to the spinoff 

full year 2014 consolidated revenue from continuing operations was 78 billion an increase of 5976 million as compared to prior year reflecting an increase in organic revenue of 44 a 44 increase in acquisitionrelated revenue and a negligible impact due to foreign currency translation increases across all four segments were led by strong results in our engineered systems fluids and energy segments our engineered systems segment achieved solid growth across both platforms resulting in overall revenue growth of 95 as compared to the prior year within the printing  identification platform of engineered systems our recent acquisition ms printing performed well as did our core printing and coding businesses in addition the industrials platform achieved broadbased growth led by our autorelated and waste handling businesses our fluids segment performed well with revenue growth of 157 as compared to the prior year as continuing robust market conditions for fluid transfer products and solid pumps markets resulted in strong organic growth supplemented by acquisitionrelated growth in our energy segment revenue growth of nearly 90 largely driven by recent acquisitions solid us drilling  production customer activity as well as generally healthy bearings  compression markets our refrigeration  food equipment segment generated revenue growth of 18 with solid performance in our refrigeration end market partially offset by the impact of product mix within our food equipment end market 

gross profit increased 1957 million or 70 to 30 billion reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes mainly due to broadbased order and shipment activity this growth was partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the current year as well as higher labor costs for further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results see consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations respectively within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

bookings increased 78 over the prior year to 78 billion representing yearoveryear growth across our energy engineered systems and fluids segments of 88 114 and 137 respectively this growth was partially offset by a 10 decrease for our refrigeration  food equipment segment overall the booktobill of 100 slightly decreased as compared to the prior year backlog of 12 billion remained relatively flat as compared to prior year 

from a geographic perspective for the year our north american european and asian markets were all solid whereas latin america was weak we anticipate our north american growth will moderate specifically for our energy segment due to the recent decline in global oil markets however we expect north america to remain a solid market for our other three segments 

we acquired a total of seven businesses in 2014 for total net consideration of 8023 million these businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within our energy fluids and refrigeration  food equipment segments and the printing  identification platform of the engineered systems segment included in these acquisitions was the october 1 2014 acquisition of accelerated companies llc accelerated a supplier of artificial lift and fluid handling solutions to oil and gas production markets the business is now part of dover artificial lift a business unit within dovers energy segment the total purchase price for this acquisition net of cash acquired and including final working capital adjustments was approximately 4357 million which was funded with commercial paper 

in addition to the aforementioned acquisitions we completed previously announced actions to adjust our costs and further streamline our businesses these actions resulted in full year 2014 restructuring charges of 448 million of which 374 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately 170 million to 200 million in the first quarter of 2015 with approximately 120 million to 150 million of these charges within our energy segment the 2015 cost savings expected to be realized as a result of the restructuring programs initiated in late 2014 and early 2015 is expected to be within the range of 700 million to 750 million in light of the economic uncertainty particularly for the energy end markets it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2015  

during the year ended december 31 2014 the company purchased a total of approximately 75 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a total cost of 6011 million or approximately 8050 per share included in this total are 36 million shares repurchased to complete the november 2012 10 billion stock repurchase program the remaining 39 million of share repurchases in 2014 were made pursuant to the share repurchase program approved in may 2012 as of december 31 2014 the approximate number of shares still available for repurchase under the may 2012 share repurchase authorization was 01 million this authorization was canceled and replaced in january 2015 with a new standing share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors whereby the company may repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock over the following three years in addition we continued our history of increasing our annual dividend payments to shareholders by paying 2585 million in dividends in 2014 

looking forward to 2015 we expect the following 

 

our 2015 guidance anticipates the combined impact of lower oil prices discontinued operations share repurchase activity and the impact of foreign currency translation we expect total revenue growth of 1 to 2 primarily reflecting our outlook for energy within our total revenue forecast organic growth is anticipated to be approximately 1 to 2 completed acquisitions will provide approximately 2 growth and the impact of foreign currency translation is expected to have a negative impact of 2 in total we expect full year adjusted eps to be in the range of 470 to 495 

if global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate our operating results for 2015 could be materially different than currently projected 

consolidated results of operations 

as discussed in note 4 disposed and discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k in the fourth quarter of 2014 we reclassified certain businesses in the engineered systems segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses the results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and are presented within results of discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

  nm not meaningful   

revenue 

our 2014  consolidated revenue increased   5976 million  or 84  to 78 billion  reflecting organic growth of 44  growth from acquisitions of 44  and a minor unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation all four segments grew solidly yearoveryear acquisition growth of 44 was largely driven by our energy segment and included recent acquisitions such as accelerated and wellmark 

our 2013  consolidated revenue increased   80  to 72 billion  compared with 2012  reflecting organic growth of 21 growth from acquisitions of 59 and a negligible impact from currency translation all four of our segments generated 2013 organic revenue growth with the majority attributed to volume increases driven by strength in energy refrigeration and food equipment and many of the other industrial markets served by our engineered systems segment 

gross profit 

our gross profit increased   1957 million  or 70  in 2014  compared with 2013  reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes gross profit margin declined 40 basis points due to the impact of higher restructuring costs of 144 million  higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization of 154 million and higher onetime labor costs as we completed the transition to new production sites 

our gross profit increased   1986 million  or 77  in 2013  compared with 2012  reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes   favorable net material costs and benefits from productivity initiatives the benefit from these factors were partly offset with higher depreciation and amortization expense of 157 million gross profit margin was consistent year over year with the operating leverage achieved by the higher volumes being offset by the impact of normal pricing concessions business mix and higher labor costs 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased   1418 million  or 88  in 2014  compared with 2013  primarily due to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes the current year expense included higher restructuring costs of 213 million  to align our businesses with anticipated market conditions and 150 million additional depreciation and amortization expense relating primarily to the recent acquisitions of finder pompe wellmark and accelerated 

as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses increased 10 basis points in 2014 to 227  results for 2014 include a 36 million onetime settlement charge for lumpsum payments made to participants in our us defined benefit pension plan selling and administrative expenses for the 2013 period also include certain onetime gains of 68 million associated with the sale of land in switzerland and pension curtailment gain of 44 million recognized in connection with the freeze of future service benefits for the us benefit plans adjusting for these onetime items selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 20 basis points in 2014 relative to 2013 a result of leverage from higher revenue levels which more than offset higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization and increased restructuring charges 

higher selling and administrative expenses in 2013 relative to 2012 reflect general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses decreased  to 226  in 2013  compared with 230  in 2012  this 40  basis point improvement is the a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels which offset higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization charges of 116 million approximately 20 basis points of this improvement is attributable to the 112 million of onetime items recognized in 2013 as discussed above 

nonoperating items 

interest expense net increased   65 million  or 54  to 1272 million  in 2014  primarily due to higher interest expense related to the eurodenominated debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2013 in 2013  our interest expense net decreased   05  to 1207 million  due primarily to lower interest rates on commercial paper borrowings for the period 

other expense income net in 2014  2013  and 2012  includes 21 million 56 million and 92 million respectively of net foreign exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances these foreign exchange losses were more than offset by other nonrecurring items including insurance settlements for property damage of 51 million and 74 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively other income for 2014 also included 17 million for earnings on minority investments during the year other expense net in 2012 also included royalty income and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains and losses none of which are individually significant 

income taxes 

we operate globally and 278 317 and 312 of our pretax earnings in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively were generated in foreign jurisdictions foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are well below the 350 us statutory rate we also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions as a result our effective nonus tax rate is typically significantly lower than the us statutory rate 

the 2014  effective tax rate on continuing operations was 289 compared to the 2013  rate of 238 the 2014 rate was impacted by 113 million of favorable net discrete items principally related to settlements of uncertain tax matters the 2013  effective tax rate was impacted by other favorable net discrete items totaling 755 million principally related to the conclusion of certain us federal state and international tax audits a favorable court opinion certain crossborder tax consequences and the effect of the american tax relief act of 2012 signed into law on january 2 2013 after adjusting for discrete items the effective tax rates were 299 for 2014  and 310 for 2013  

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the 

potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to 270 million some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

the 2012  effective tax rate on continuing operations was 302 the effective tax rate in 2012  was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling 178 million arising principally from settlements with the us federal and state taxing authorities after adjusting for discrete and other items the effective tax rate for 2012 was 321 

earnings from continuing operations 

earnings from continuing operations decreased   24  to 7781 million  or 461  diluted earnings per share eps in 2014  compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7975 million  or 460  eps in 2013  excluding the impact of discrete tax benefits of 113 million  or 007  eps in 2014  and 755 million  or 043  eps in 2013  earnings from continuing operations increased 62  the increase in these adjusted earnings for 2014  is primarily due to higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives offset by higher restructuring and acquisitionrelated expenses excluding the impact of discrete tax items eps increased 91 in 2014 reflecting the impact of higher earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding relative to 2013 due to over seven million shares repurchased during the year 

earnings from continuing operations increased   227  to 7975 million  or 460  eps in 2013  compared with earnings from continuing operations of 6501 million  or 353  eps in 2012  excluding the impact of discrete tax benefits of 755 million  in 2013 and 178 million or 010 eps in 2012 earnings from continuing operations increased 142 the increase in 2013  adjusted earnings is primarily the result of higher revenues offset in part by higher labor costs across all segments as well as higher acquisitionrelated expenses including depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of discrete tax items eps increased 212 in 2013 which reflects the increase in earnings as well as the impact of six million share buybacks during the period 

  

discontinued operations 

the results of discontinued operations reflect the results of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace which were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2014 these results also include knowles prior to the distribution on february 28 2014 and the results of dek and ect prior to their respective sale dates of july 2 2014 and november 30 2013 

the results of discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2014 totaled a net loss of 29 million  this amount includes a loss on the sale of dek of 69 million  and a gain of 32 million  in connection with a working capital adjustment for ect which was sold in the prior year also reflected within the net loss from discontinued operations is 323 million of aftertax earnings for those businesses classified as discontinued operations 271 million of spinoff costs and a pension settlement charge of 44 million  net of tax attributable to lump sum payments made to knowles participants in dovers qualified defined benefit pension plan 

  

earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013 totaled net earnings of 2056 million  which primarily reflects aftertax earnings of the five businesses classified as discontinued operations as well as discrete tax benefits of 548 million 301 million of spinoff costs and 183 million of interest on tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions also reflected in discontinued operations is a net loss on the sale of ect including impairments of 215 million and 140 million of impairment relating to dek 

earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2012 totaled net earnings of 1610 million  which primarily reflects aftertax earnings of the five businesses classified as discontinued operations as well as various expense and accrual adjustments relating to other discontinued operations this activity was offset by a goodwill impairment charge recognized in connection with the anticipated sale of ect of 519 million  net of tax

2014  versus 2013   

fluids segment revenue increased 1937 million or 157 compared to 2013  comprised of organic growth of 75 acquisitionrelated growth of 83 partially offset by a 01 unfavorable foreign currency impact 

 

 

fluids segment earnings increased 271 million or 121 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the comparable prior year period as volume leverage productivity initiatives and strategic pricing more than offset incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions including approximately 107 million of depreciation and amortization operating margin decreased 60 basis points primarily due to the aforementioned impact of recent acquisitions as well as higher restructuring charges to better streamline businesses particularly within the businesses serving the pumps end market 

bookings for 2014  decreased 137  as compared to 2013  and backlog levels decreased 105 at december 31 2014  compared to the prior year end primarily reflecting the timing of projectrelated orders within pumps book to bill was solid at 10 

2013  versus 2012 

  

fluids segment revenue increased 1493 million or 137  compared to 2012  attributable to organic revenue growth of 68 and acquisitionrelated growth of 69 

 

 

fluids segment earnings increased 420 million or 230  in 2013  compared to 2012  with an increase in operating margin of 140 basis points as the increased sales volume and productivity initiatives more than offset higher acquisitionrelated costs including depreciation and amortization 

refrigeration  food equipment 

our refrigeration  food equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food service industries 



2014  versus 2013   

revenue generated by our refrigeration  food equipment segment in 2014  increased 333 million or 18  compared to 2013  the overall increase in revenue includes organic growth of 17 and acquisition growth of 02 foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 01 

 

 

refrigeration  food equipment segment earnings in 2014  decreased 286 million or 107  compared with 2013  with a decrease in operating margin of 180 basis points the earnings and margin decreases were driven by nonrecurring restructuring of 249 million 194 million higher as compared to 2013 primarily for the closure of a europeanbased facility unfavorable product mix as well as a 68 million land sale gain in the prior year that did not repeat 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2014  decreased slightly as compared to 2013 reflecting anticipated lower orders for refrigeration and the timing of orders for food equipment backlog at december 31 2014  decreased 186 due to the aforementioned timing of orders for food equipment book to bill was 097 

2013  versus 2012   

revenue generated by our refrigeration  food equipment segment increased 2802 million or 174  compared with 2012  the overall increase in revenue resulted primarily acquisitionrelated growth of 160 as well as organic revenue growth of 14 

 

 

refrigeration  food equipments 2013  earnings increased 197  compared with 2012  with an increase in operating margin of 30 basis points the earnings and margin increases were mainly due to the impact of recent acquisitions and productivity savings partially offset by acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization expense 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2014   decreased   294 million  relative to 2013  this decline was driven by higher  investments in working capital of 434 million  in 2014  relative to the prior year due primarily due to the impact of timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments in addition higher tax payments of approximately 540 million  contributed to the decline in operating cash flow in 2014 these reductions were partially offset by higher continuing earnings before the impact of depreciation amortization and restructuring expenses and lower pension contributions of 160 million  

cash provided by operating activities in 2013   increased   112 million  as compared to the prior year this increase was driven by higher earnings from continuing operations however increased investments in working capital of 774 million  mostly due to the timing of customer payments reduced operating cash flow higher longterm and annual incentive compensation payouts in 2013 drove reductions in compensation accruals of approximately 643 million  additionally higher tax payments of 519 million  further reduced operating cash flow in 2013 

pension and postretirement activity  the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to the us qualified benefit plans totaled 90 million and 180 million in 2013  and 2012  respectively due to the overfunded status of this plan the company made no contributions in 2014 and expects to make minimal contributions in the near term 

our significant international pension obligations are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2014  2013  and 2012  totaled 95 million 98 million and 72 million respectively in 2015 we expect to contribute approximately 65 million  to our nonus plans see note 15 employee benefit plans  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital in 2014  adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased from 2013  by 1659 million or 131 to 14 billion which reflected an increase in receivables of 1101 million an increase in net inventory of 1484 million and an increase in accounts payable of 926 million generally due to the impact of timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments in 2014  excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of 513 million adjusted working capital would have increased by 814 million or 64 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities are derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

 

 

 

 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make in 2015 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper the use of established lines of credit or accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

 

 

 

 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

in 2014  the businesses reported as discontinued operations generated net cash flow of 60 million  these cash flows reflect the operating results of datamax oneil and sargent aerospace as well as knowles prior to its spinoff in the first quarter and dek prior to its sale in the third quarter cash flow generated for this period primarily reflects cash generated from operations of approximately 538 million offset by costs incurred for the spinoff of knowles of 271 million and capital expenditures of 206 million 

2013  and 2012  cash flows of 658 million  and 1711 million  respectively include full year results for those business classified as discontinued operations which include knowles dek ect datamax oneil and sargent aerospace higher investments in working capital of 1154 million in 2013 relative to 2012 as well as costs of 301 million incurred in 2013 in connection with the spinoff of knowles contributed to the decline in operating cash flows from discontinued operations in 2013 offset by higher earnings and lower capital expenditures for the period 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt pay dividends fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2014  we generated free cash flow of 7841 million  representing 101  of revenue and 1008  of earnings from continuing operations free cash flow in 2013  was 8379 million  or 117  of revenue compared to 8219 million  or 124  of revenue in 2012  the full year decrease in 2014  free cash flow reflects a higher investment in working capital and higher capital expenditures partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization we expect to generate free cash flow in 2015 of approximately 110 of revenue 

the 2013  increase in free cash flow compared to 2012  reflects higher earnings from continuing operations and lower capital expenditures partially offset by higher investments in working capital and higher tax payments in 2013  

  

net debt to net capitalization 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 388  at december 31 2014  compared to 274  at december 31 2013  the increase in this ratio was driven primarily by the reduction in our net capitalization of 13 billion for the period primarily due to the 14 billion distribution of knowles 6011 million in share repurchases and 2585 million of dividends offset by 7752 million of current earnings as described above we also received a cash payment of 3600 million from knowles net of cash distributed upon separation on february 28 2014 which was used to fund share repurchases and reduce commercial paper balances net debt increased 3248 million during the period primarily due to increases in commercial paper balances and a reduction in cash levels to fund acquisitions dividend payments and other general operating purposes 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased slightly at december 31 2013  compared to the prior yearend due to the significant increase in equity levels driven by current net earnings offset in part by 284 million of additional net borrowings we replaced commercial paper borrowings in 2013 with the issuance of €3000 million of 2125 eurodenominated notes due 2020 from which we received proceeds of approximately 4038 million 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock we currently maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to 10 billion and expires on november 10 2016 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a eurodollar or sterling rate based on libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 0565 to 1225 subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by sp and moody’s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility under this facility we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2014  and had a coverage ratio of 127 to 10 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2014  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 6816 million  of which approximately 5098 million was held outside the united states cash and equivalents are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade money market instruments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less we regularly invest cash in excess of nearterm requirements in money market instruments or shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months 

in 2014 we made a onetime cash dividend of approximately 2350 million as a result of certain restructuring arising from the spinoff of knowles the us tax consequences of this intercompany dividend which were not significant have been included in our total income tax expense since the remaining cash our foreign subsidiaries hold is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax payable if some or all of such funds were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability management believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2014  



shortterm ratings of p1 a1 and f1 are defined as a strong or superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations a longterm rating of a or a2 is defined as a strong capacity to meet financial commitments but susceptible to adverse business or economic conditions 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 1355 million  outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire at various dates in 2015  through 2020  these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2014  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2014  we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2014  yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2421 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries primarily in canada mexico substantially all of the european countries brazil argentina malaysia china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges and at december 31 2014  we had one outstanding floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of 500 million  in exchange for chf 651 million  which matures on october 15 2015 this transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in nonus operations the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings the fair values at december 31 2014  and 2013  reflected cumulative losses of 156 million  and 237 million  respectively due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement due to the movement in currency rates subsequent to december 31 2014 the loss on this net investment hedge has increased to approximately 210 million 

additionally the company has designated the €3000 million  of eurodenominated notes issued december 4 2013 as a hedge of a portion of the its net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the devaluation of the euro relative to the us dollar in the latter half of 2014 the us dollar equivalent of this debt decreased resulting in the recognition of a gain in other comprehensive income of 476 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  in contrast the company recognized a loss of 61 million  for the year ended december 31 2013 due to the appreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar at that time 

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing however such contracts outstanding at december 31 2014  were not significant 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 

 44 

have been rendered the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment service revenue represents less than 5 of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements 

 

 

 

 45 

international issues that are currently unresolved we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

 

 

recent accounting standards 

in june 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201412 which requires that a performance target for sharebased payments that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition under this new standard compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered this update is effective for annual periods 

beginning after december 15 2015 the company has evaluated this guidance and determined that the adoption will not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 that introduces a new fivestep revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period the company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements 

in april 2014 the fasb issued asu 201408 which includes amendments that change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations and require additional disclosures about discontinued operations under the new guidance only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations  that is a major effect on the organizations operations and financial results  should be presented as discontinued operations additionally the asu requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets liabilities income and expenses of discontinued operations this update is effective for dover in the first quarter of 2015 the company has evaluated this guidance and determined that the adoption will not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 which provides that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion thereof should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except to the extent that a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from disallowance of a tax position or the tax law does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose then the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability this standard was effective for dover for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 the company adopted this guidance effective january 1 2014 the adoption of this asu did not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements 

in march 2013 the fasb issued asu 201305 which permits an entity to release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when a reporting entity parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity accordingly the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided or if a controlling financial interest is no longer held the revised standard was effective for dover for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 the company adopted this guidance effective january 1 2014 the adoption of this asu did not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 201302 which requires additional disclosures regarding the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 requires an entity to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period this guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 the company adopted this guidance effective january 1 2013 the companys adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinitelived intangible asset per the terms of this asu an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the entity determines based on qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired the revised standard was effective for dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 its adoption did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment 

ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow net debt total debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital earnings adjusted for nonrecurring items effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities debt or equity earnings revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings segment margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of free cash flow total debt and net debt can be found above in this item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers we believe that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called working capital which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes given the global nature of our businesses we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

the following table shows the percentage of total revenue and segment earnings generated by each of our four segments for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  



management philosophy 

our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital our operating structure of four business segments and two platforms allows for focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of our executive talent our segment and executive management set strategic direction initiatives and goals provide oversight allocate and manage capital are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services we foster an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness 

in addition we are committed to creating value for our customers employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and developing products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals our companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow 

company goals   

we are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives first we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth over the midterm of 3 to 5 complemented by acquisition growth of 3 to 5 over the same period secondly we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives including supply chain activities strategic pricing and portfolio shaping lastly we are committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 10 through disciplined capital allocation strong performance productivity improvements and active working capital management we support these goals through 1 alignment of management compensation with financial objectives 2 welldefined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 talent development programs 

business strategy 

to achieve our goals we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies 

positioning ourselves for growth 

we have aligned our business segments to focus on keyend markets that are wellpositioned for future growth in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on growth trends in the areas of global energy demand sustainability consumer product safety communications and emerging economies for instance our communication technologies segment is positioned to capitalize on growth in handheld communications handsets medical technology and aerospacedefense with its complement of micro audio components and communication components serving those markets our energy segment is driven by a growing demand for innovative extraction technologies the growing demand from emerging economies plus expanding exploration activity around the globe will provide significant opportunities for this segment our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies while our printing  identification segment is responding to the growing requirements for consumer product safety and traceability technologies by providing integrated printing coding and identification solutions with a global reach in the growing markets of fast moving consumer goods and industrial applications 

capturing the benefits of common ownership 

we are committed to operational excellence and have implemented various productivity initiatives such as supply chain management lean manufacturing and facility consolidations to maximize our efficiency coupled with workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees we foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization to ensure success our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets we have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in china brazil and india further we continue to make significant investments in talent development recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success 

disciplined capital allocation 

our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns to do this we grow and support our existing businesses with annual investment in capital spending approximating 25 of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets develop products and boost productivity we continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth spaces consumer electronics energy product id refrigeration and food equipment and fluid solutions we consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 58 years we will also continue to repurchase our shares per our previously announced share repurchase programs 

portfolio development 

acquisitions   

our acquisition program has two key elements first we seek to acquire value creating addon businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers or by broadening their product mix second in the right circumstances we will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces over the past three years  2011  – 2013  we have spent over 27 billion  to purchase 26  businesses that strategically fit within our business model this included the largest acquisition in our history that of sound solutions in july of 2011 for net purchase consideration of approximately 7793 million by enhancing the product offerings serving the high growth handset market the acquisition of sound solutions has enabled our communication technologies segment to be a global leader in audio components serving this market in 2012 we spent approximately 6032 million to acquire anthony international a leading manufacturer of specialty glass commercial glass refrigerator and freezer doors lighting systems and display equipment the acquisition of anthony expands our portfolio of industryleading technology in the refrigeration space and provides access to new geographies and new markets most notably the convenience store market recent significant acquisitions have also included harbisonfischer which we acquired for approximately 4014 million at the beginning of 2011 in order to enhance our artificial lift portfolio within our energy segment maag pump systems a european acquisition for our fluid solutions platform which we acquired in the first quarter of 2012 for approximately 2658 million production control services acquired in the second quarter of 2012 for consideration totaling 2200 million which added to our artificial lift technology in our energy segment and finder pompe which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013 for approximately 1422 million to expand our fluid solutions platform 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 3 acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3  4 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal tool kit and defined processes to help ensure synergies are realized and value is created as had been planned when the acquisition was made 

dispositions   

we continually review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our longterm strategy occasionally we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations accordingly in an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces during the past three years  2011  – 2013  we have sold four  businesses for aggregate consideration of 6048 million  over the same period disposals of a few minor noncore divisions of our businesses generated additional proceeds of 85 million  in addition the company signed a definitive agreement in 2013 to sell dek international within the printing  identification segment and expects to complete the sale of this business in the first half of 2014 

the financial position and results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented for more details see note 4 disposed and discontinued operations  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

spinoff of knowles 

on may 23 2013 dover announced its board of directors approved a preliminary plan to spinoff certain of its communication technologies businesses into a standalone publiclytraded company known as knowles corporation knowles on february 6 2014 dover announced that its board of directors approved the separation of knowles from dover through the pro rata distribution by dover of 100 of the common stock of knowles to dovers stockholders on february 28 2014 in addition on february 10 2014 the us securities and exchange commission declared knowles registration statement on form 10 effective as a result the following is expected to occur 1 the distribution of knowles shares would be made on february 28 2014 to dover stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 19 2014 the record date for the distribution 2 on the distribution date dover stockholders will receive one share of knowles common stock for every two shares of dover common stock held as of the record date and 3 following the distribution knowles will be an independent publicly traded 

company on the new york stock exchange utilizing ticker symbol kn and dover will retain no ownership interest in knowles the distribution has been structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposesthe results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the businesses to be transferred to knowles and included in the spinoff are and will continue to be presented within dovers consolidated financial statements as continuing operations within the communication technologies segment until the spinoff is complete which is expected to occur on february 28 2014 upon which the financial presentation of these businesses will be included within dovers discontinued operations following the spinoff of knowles dover expects to align its segment structure to ensure it is properly organized to execute its future growth plans 

business segments 

as noted previously we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key endmarkets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments energy engineered systems printing  identification and communication technologies for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 17 segment information  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

energy 

our energy segment serves the oil gas and power generation industries with products that promote efficient and costeffective drilling extraction storage and movement of oil and gas products or constitute critical components for power generation equipment this segment consists of the following lines of business 

 

 

 

our energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels we manufacture our products primarily in north america and our sales are concentrated in north america with an increasing level of international sales directed largely to europe central and south america china the middle east and australia 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability consumer product safety needs and growth in emerging economies to better serve its endmarkets the segment manages its products and services through two core business platforms refrigeration  industrial and fluid solutions as described below 

refrigeration  industrial 

the refrigeration  industrial platform manufactures products and systems serving the refrigeration and food equipment and other industrial markets as follows 

 

the majority of the refrigerationfood systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the refrigeration  industrial platform are used by the supermarket industry “bigbox” retail and convenience stores the commercialindustrial refrigeration industry institutional and commercial foodservice and food production markets and beverage canmaking industries the commercial foodservice cooking equipment products serve their markets worldwide through a network of 

dealers distributors national chain accounts manufacturer representatives and a direct sales force with the primary market being north america 

 

the businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps power clamps rotary and linear mechanical indexers conveyors pick and place units glove ports and manipulators as well as endofarm robotic grippers slides and end effectors these products serve a very broad market including food processing packaging paper processing medical electronic automotive nuclear and general industrial products they are produced in north america europe and asia and are marketed globally on a direct basis to oems and through a global dealer and distribution network to industrial end users we also provide highly engineered hydraulic cylinders and swivels to the north american markets for use in mining and resource recovery vehicle recovery materials handling and various other oem applications 

our businesses serving waste and recycling markets provide products and services for the refuse collection industry and for onsite processing and compaction of trash and recyclable materials products are sold to municipal customers national accounts and independent waste haulers through a network of distributors and directly in certain geographic areas the onsite waste management and recycling systems include a variety of stationary compactors wire processing and separation machines and balers that are manufactured and sold primarily in the united states to distribution centers malls stadiums arenas office complexes retail stores and recycling centers 

fluid solutions 

the fluid solutions platform designs and manufactures pumps compressors and chemical proportioning and dispensing products the pumps and compressors are used to transfer liquid and bulk products and are sold to a wide variety of markets including the refined fuels lpg pulp and paper wastewater foodsanitary military transportation and chemical process industries the pumps include centrifugal reciprocating double diaphragm and rotary pumps that are used in demanding and specialized fluid transfer process applications the chemical portioning and dispensing systems are used to dilute and dispense concentrated cleaning chemicals and are sold to the food service health care supermarket institutional school building service contractor and industrial markets in addition the platform manufactures copperbrazed compact heat exchangers and designs software for heating and cooling substations fluid solutions products are manufactured in the united states south america asia and europe and marketed globally through direct channels and a network of distributors 

printing  identification 

our printing  identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking  coding printing dispensing soldering and coating equipment and related consumables and services the segment serves two broad global endmarkets fast moving consumer goods and industrial 

 

 8 

pallets for use in warehouse logistics operations and bar code and portable printers used where ondemand labelsreceipts are required 

printing  identification’s products are manufactured primarily in the united states france china and india and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

communication technologies 

our communication technologies segment serves the following major markets consumer electronics aerospacedefense medical technology and telecomother 

 

 

 

 

communication technologies’ products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum select other commodities and rare earth metals although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

research and development 

our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2013  we spent 1856  million for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2012  and 2011  research and development spending totaled 1898  million and 1755  million respectively 

our communication technologies and printing  identification segments expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment and specialty electronic components for the consumer electronics medical technology and datacomtelecom markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the communication technologies and printing  identification segments 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

seasonality 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste and recycling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2013  given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are quite varied businesses supplying the waste and recycling agricultural defense energy automotive commercial refrigeration handset and hearing aid industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

certain of our businesses particularly within the communication technologies segment serve the military space aerospace commercial and telecom infrastructure markets their customers include some of the largest businesses in these markets in addition many of the oem customers within the communication technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers and many of the largest global ems companies particularly in china 

backlog   

backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily for the global pump and refrigeration and food equipment markets of our engineered systems segment as well as the aerospacedefense market of our communication technologies segment our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of december 31 2013  and 2012  was 16 billion  and 15 billion  respectively 

competition   

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition certain businesses in the communication technologies and printing  identification segments compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and east asia a summary of our key competitors by end market within each our segments follows 



international   

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia and eastern europe 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and with increasing emphasis australia canada china malaysia india mexico brazil and eastern europe 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our percentage of revenue derived from customers outside of the us increased slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012 as a result of improvement in communication technologies in the asian markets and energys geographic expansion programs in the middle east and australia 

our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in “item 1a risk factors” for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 17 segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

in 2010 we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and have developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we also participated as a respondent in the 2012 carbon disclosure project 

all of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers including but not limited to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass through” costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees   

we had approximately 37000  employees in our ongoing operations as of december 31 2013  which was an increase of 6  from the prior year end the increase is primarily the result of recent acquisitions slightly offset by headcount reduction programs in certain businesses 

other information 

we make available through the “financial reports” link on our internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed 

 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

our energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact production although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

 

approximately 48  of our revenues for 2013  and 46  of our revenues for 2012  were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products 

and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences new business models and technologies and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

certain of our communication technologies businesses sell their products in electronic and technologybased industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive in these industries they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands if these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes it could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” requirement for disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined in the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries it is possible that some of our businesses customers will require “conflict free” metals in products purchased from us we have begun the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses as required by the doddfrank act the supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors we may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers manufacturing operations and operating profits 

  

the need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts lead to supply shortages or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods 

 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws including environmental and exportimport laws regulations and policies failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates in addition we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china and may in the future invest in other countries any of which may carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

  

 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations we may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated exposed to unexpected liabilities and unable to to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations if we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot be assured that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

 

our growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives if we are unsuccessful in these efforts our operating results could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies 

  

 

our businesses rely on a number of information technologies to manage store and support business activities we have put in place a number of systems processes and practices designed to protect against intentional or unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information disruption of our operations or corruption of the software that supports our products disruptions or cybersecurity attacks such as unauthorized access malicious software or other violations may lead to exposure of proprietary or confidential information as well as potential data corruption any intrusion may cause operational stoppages loss of business violations of applicable law diminished competitive advantages or reputational damages and increased operational costs for remedial activities 

  

 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy laws as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation 

  

 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations which are presented in us dollars a significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lowercost locations and sold in various countries crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling swiss franc chinese renminbi yuan and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries such as china our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our longterm debt as of december 31 2013  although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings if our current credit ratings deteriorate then our borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under our fiveyear credit facility and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

there can be no assurance that the spinoff of knowles will be completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe or at all if the spinoff transaction is not completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe or not completed at all among other things the price of dovers stock may decline 

we have and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed transaction which may exceed our current expectations 

we cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed transaction will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved if at all for example there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will place values on each of the independent companies that will equal a total value that is greater than that which dover has today in addition if the proposed spinoff is consummated our operational and financial profile will change and we will face new risks including the possibility of reduced financial resources and less diversification of our revenue sources which could adversely impact our future results in addition the changes in our operational and financial profile may not meet some of our shareholders investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their shares and otherwise decrease demand for our common stock excess selling could cause the relative market price of our common stock to decrease and be subject to greater volatility following the consummation of the proposed spinoff 

 

a condition to the spinoff is the receipt by us of either i a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs together with an opinion of baker  mckenzie llp our tax counsel substantively to the effect that among other things the distribution of shares to our shareholders will qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code or ii an opinion of baker  mckenzie llp our tax counsel substantively to the effect that among other things the spinoff will qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 36xcid of the code we received an opinion from baker  mckenzie llp that the spinoff will so qualify which opinion is expected to be confirmed on the distribution date of the knowles spinoff the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings of us and knowles including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we may not be able to rely on the opinion and we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion in addition we and knowles intend for certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment we would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if we had sold the knowles common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the knowles common stock received in the distribution in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law we could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended december 31 2013  the mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in item 8 of this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in item 1a “risk factors” and in the “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” preceding part i of this form 10k 

overview and outlook 

dover is a diversified global manufacturer focusing on innovative equipment and components specialty systems and support services provided through its four major operating segments energy engineered systems printing  identification and communication technologies the companys entrepreneurial business model encourages promotes and fosters deep customer engagement which has led to dovers wellestablished and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industryleading product innovation unless the context indicates otherwise references herein to “dover” “the company” and words such as “we” “us” and “our” include dover corporation and its subsidiaries 

our energy segment provides highlyengineered solutions for the safe and efficient extraction and handling of oil and gas in the production downstream and drilling markets our engineered systems segment is comprised of two platforms refrigeration  industrial and fluid solutions which are industry leaders in the refrigeration and food equipment certain other industrial markets and fluids systems our printing  identification segment provides integrated printing coding and dispensing solutions for the fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets our communication technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components in the consumer electronics aerospacedefense medical technology and telecommunicationother markets 

we delivered solid growth during 2013 as our consolidated revenue increased 77 representing organic growth of 29 and acquisitionrelated growth of 48 the impact from foreign currency translation was negligible gross profit increased 2327 million or 75 to 33 billion we saw momentum in the second half of the year as broadbased order and shipment activity was particularly strong at our businesses serving the refrigeration and food equipment fast moving consumer goods fluids drilling and downstream energy markets in the consumer electronics market revenue growth was due to increased microelectronic mechanical “mems” microphone volumes resulting from new oem product introductions and overall smartphone market growth this growth was offset in part by the continued market decline of two oem customers principally affecting our speaker and receiver volumes overall productivity initiatives and the leveraging of higher volumes more than offset normal pricing concessions for further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results see consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations respectively within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

bookings increased 82 over the prior year to 87 billion representing growth across all segments with strong growth of 127 in engineered systems and increases of 59 in communications technologies 55 in energy and 24 in printing  identification overall the booktobill of 100 slightly improved over the prior year backlog increased 46 to 16 billion 

from a geographic perspective for the year our north american markets were solid our european markets continued to show improvement throughout the year with incremental growth driven by our short cycle business activity complemented by project shipments china and the rest of the world markets were strong 

on may 23 2013 dover announced its board of directors approved a preliminary plan to spinoff certain of its communication technologies businesses into a standalone publiclytraded company known as knowles corporation knowles on february 6 2014 dover announced that its board of directors approved the separation of knowles from dover through the pro rata distribution by dover of 100 of the common stock of knowles to dovers stockholders on february 28 2014 in addition on february 10 2014 the us securities and exchange commission declared knowles registration statement on form 10 effective as a result the following is expected to occur 1 the distribution of knowles shares would be made on february 28 2014 to dover stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 19 2014 the record date for the distribution 2 on the distribution date dover stockholders will receive one share of knowles common stock for every two shares of dover 

common stock held as of the record date and 3 following the distribution knowles will be an independent publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange utilizing ticker symbol kn and dover will retain no ownership interest in knowles the distribution has been structured to be taxfree to dover and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes the results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the businesses to be transferred to knowles and included in the spinoff are and will continue to be presented within dovers consolidated financial statements as continuing operations within the communication technologies segment until the spinoff is complete which is expected to occur on february 28 2014 upon which the financial presentation of these businesses will be included within dovers discontinued operations onetime costs associated with the transaction are expected to be in the range of 600 to 700 million of which 301 million has been incurred by dover through december 31 2013 following the spinoff of knowles dover expects to align its segment structure to ensure it is properly organized to execute its future growth plans 

as previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2012 in connection with our periodic review for our businesses strategic fit within dover we announced our intention to divest dek international and everett charles technologies including the multitest business collectively ect within the printing  identification segment these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations and in 2013 we recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 545 million as well as a 255 million tax benefit in the discontinued operations deferred income tax provision for 2013 the company completed the sale of ect in the fourth quarter of 2013 for total proceeds of 927 million which resulted in an aftertax loss on sale of 28 million in 2013 the company signed a definitive agreement to sell dek based on the anticipated proceeds from this sale the company recognized an impairment loss of 140 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 management intends to complete the sale of dek in the first half of 2014 

other actions that we undertook in order to strengthen our position in 2014 and beyond included raising €3000 million in the euro debt market in 2013 some of the proceeds were used to repay commercial paper of approximately 3810 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 in addition we expanded our competitive position with ten business acquisitions during the year for net cash consideration of approximately 3230 million notably in the fluids and downstream energy spaces dover expects additional acquisitions to be closed in the first quarter of 2014 

under our november 2012 10 billion share repurchase program we repurchased 60 million shares during the year for a total of 4573 million there is 2926 million remaining under this program and we expect to complete the balance of this program in the first quarter of 2014 in addition we continued our history of increasing our annual dividend payments to shareholders by paying 2478 million in dividends in 2013 

regarding our business activity near term we expect 

 

if global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate our operating results for 2014 could be materially different than currently projected 

consolidated results of operations 

as discussed in note 4 disposed and discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k in the fourth quarter of 2012 we reclassified certain businesses in the printing  identification segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses the results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and are presented within results of discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

  

revenue 

our 2013  consolidated revenue increased  6255 million or 77  to 87 billion  reflecting organic growth of 29  and growth from acquisitions of 48  the impact from foreign currency translation was negligible increased volume in 2013 across all segments drove a revenue increase of 30 as compared to 2012 we saw momentum in the second half of the year as broadbased order and shipment activity was particularly strong at our businesses serving the refrigeration and food equipment fast moving consumer goods fluids drilling and downstream energy markets in the consumer electronics market revenue growth was due to increased microelectronic mechanical “mems” microphone volumes resulting from new oem product introductions and overall smartphone market growth this growth was offset in part by the continued market decline of two oem customers principally affecting our speaker and receiver volumes overall productivity initiatives and the leveraging of higher volumes more than offset normal pricing concessions 

the majority of the 48  acquisitionrelated revenue growth in 2013  as compared to the prior year was generated from acquisitions made in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013 within our engineered systems and energy segments including anthony international power soak ebsray pumps the curottocan inc and upco inc these acquisitions accounted for approximately 800 of acquisitionrelated revenue growth as compared to the prior year 

our 2012  consolidated revenue increased   100  to 81 billion  compared with 2011  reflecting organic growth of 55 growth from acquisitions of 58 and an unfavorable impact from currency translation of 13 all four of our segments generated 2013  organic revenue growth with the majority attributed to volume increases driven by strength in the energy handset refrigeration and food equipment and many of the other industrial markets served by our engineered systems segment approximately 30 of our growth was generated by new products particularly in our communication technologies segment and geographic market expansion in our energy segment pricing had a negligible impact to 2012 revenue as price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs were partly offset by lower strategic pricing initiatives revenues generated outside of the us increased by 90 compared with 2011 with growth in canada and asia offsetting weakness in europe 

over 800 of the 2012  revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by sound solutions maag pump systems and production control services three of our more significant recent acquisitions made in the second half of 2011 and first half of 2012 

gross profit 

our gross profit increased   2327 million  or 75  in 2013  compared with 2012  reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes favorable net material costs and benefits from productivity initiatives the benefit from these factors were partly offset with higher depreciation and amortization expense of 522 million and higher restructuring costs of 82 million gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 383  year over year with the operating leverage achieved by the higher volumes being offset by the impact of normal pricing concessions business mix and higher labor costs across all segments 

our gross profit increased   2623 million  or 92  in 2012  compared with 2011  reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes   favorable net material costs and benefits from productivity initiatives gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 30  basis points in 2012  to 383  from 386  in 2011  with the reduction in large part due to the integration of sound solutions which generated lower than anticipated revenue in 2012 more than offsetting the operating leverage achieved by our other businesses 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased   1442 million  or 78  in 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes the current year expense also included 301 million in onetime transaction costs related to the spinoff of knowles and higher depreciation and amortization expense of 118 million these expenses were partially offset by a 68 million gain associated with the sale of land in switzerland in the first quarter of 2013 and a onetime pension curtailment gain of 44 million recognized in the third quarter of 2013 as a result of the companys announcement to freeze future service benefits for the us benefit plans after january 1 2024 as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses remained constant at 227  as the higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization was more than offset by the leveraging of higher revenue volumes 

selling and administrative expenses increased   1207 million  or 70  in 2012  compared with 2011  due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses decreased  to 227  in 2012  compared with 234  in 2011  this 70  basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels which more than offset higher acquisitionrelated amortization and increased restructuring charges 

nonoperating items 

interest expense net decreased   04 million  or 03  to 1207 million  in 2013  primarily due to lower average levels of cash on hand at reduced interest rates which offset higher interest expense related to the eurodenominated debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2013 

in 2012  our interest expense net increased   49  to 1211 million  due primarily to lower average levels of cash on hand at reduced interest rates leading to 44 million less of interest income in 2012 as compared with 2011 

other expense income net in 2013  2012  and 2011  includes 61 million 95 million and 75 million respectively of net foreign exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances the 2013 net foreign exchange losses are more than offset by other nonrecurring items including approximately 74 million related to insurance settlements for property damage as well as several other miscellaneous items none of which were individually significant other expense income net in 2012 and 2011 included royalty income and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains and losses none of which are individually significant 

income taxes 

we operate globally and 373  384  and 429  of our pretax earnings in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively were generated in foreign jurisdictions where such earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are well below the 350 us statutory rate we also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as a result our blended effective foreign or nonus tax rate is typically significantly lower than the us statutory rate 

the 2013 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 219  compared to the 2012  rate of 268  the 2013   rate was impacted by 770 million of favorable net discrete items principally related to the conclusion of certain us federal state and international tax audits a favorable court interpretation of tax law certain crossborder tax consequences and the effect of the american tax relief act of 2012 signed into law on january 2 2013 the 2012  effective tax rate was impacted by other favorable net discrete items totaling 161 million principally related to settlements with us federal and state taxing authorities after adjusting for discrete items the effective tax rates were 282 for both 2013  and 2012  

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to 372 million some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

the 2011  effective tax rate on continuing operations was 235  the effective tax rate in 2011  was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling 407 million arising principally from settlements with the us federal and state taxing authorities after adjusting for discrete and other items the effective tax rate for 2011  was 275 

earnings from continuing operations 

earnings from continuing operations increased   159  to 9658 million  or 557  diluted earnings per share eps in 2013  compared with earnings from continuing operations of 8331 million  or 453  eps in 2012  the increase in 2013  earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives offset in part by higher labor costs across all segments as well as higher acquisitionrelated expenses including depreciation and amortization the eps increase reflects the increase in earnings as well as the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding for the 2013 period relative to 2012 

earnings from continuing operations increased   78  to 8331 million  or 453  eps in 2012  compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7732 million  or 409  eps in 2011  the increase in 2012  earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives offset in part by higher acquisitionrelated expenses and increased restructuring charges relative to 2011 the eps increase reflects the increase in earnings as well as the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding for the 2012 period relative to 2011 further we repurchased incrementally more common shares in 2012 as compared to 2011 

  

discontinued operations 

management evaluates dovers businesses periodically for their strategic fit within dovers operations accordingly in 2012 the company announced its intention to divest dek international and everett charles technologies including the multitest business collectively ect within the printing  identification segment which serve the electronic assembly and test markets these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company completed the sale of ect in the fourth quarter of 2013 for total proceeds of 927  million additionally in 2013 the company signed a definitive agreement to sell dek management plans to complete the sale of this business in the first half of 2014 

earnings from discontinued operations net of tax for the year ended december 31 2013 totaled 373 million which included a loss on sale of ect including impairments of 355 million net of tax earnings from operations of the aforementioned businesses prior to sale of 179 million before tax and an income tax benefit of 549 million onetime impairment charges netting to 355 million included the following a 28 million loss on the sale of ect a 442 million goodwill impairment charge resulting from the writedown of the carrying value to fair value based on the current estimated sales price of ect a benefit of 255 million to the deferred income tax provision as a result of the elimination of certain deferred tax liabilities and a 140 million impairment loss related to the expected proceeds for the anticipated sale of dek of which approximately 92 million represented a goodwill impairment charge of which none is taxable 

loss from discontinued operations net of tax for the year ended december 31 2012 totaled 220 million net earnings from operations of 288  million reflects net earnings from operations generated by these two businesses as well as various expense and accrual adjustments relating to other discontinued operations this activity was more than offset by a goodwill impairment charge determined in connection with the anticipated sale of ect at which time the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 638  million  519  million after tax representing a writedown of the reporting units carrying value of goodwill to its fair value 

earnings from discontinued operations net of tax for the year ended december 31 2011 totaled 1221 million in 2011 the company sold three businesses paladin brands crenlo llc and heil trailer international that had operated within the engineered systems segment for total cash proceeds of 5121  million these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 the 2011 earnings from discontinued operations reflects net operating earnings generated by the two businesses discontinued in 2012 and the three business sold in 2011 coupled with tax benefits of 180  million relating primarily to discrete tax items settled or resolved during the year earnings from discontinued operations also includes a 47  million loss on the 2011 sale of the three businesses inclusive of an aftertax goodwill impairment charge of 761  million representing a writedown of the carrying value of the associated reporting units goodwill to its fair value

restructuring activities 

2013  restructuring activities 

the company incurred restructuring charges during 2013  totaling 259 million  related to these programs as follows 

 

 

 

 

we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately 50  million to 150 million  in 2014  in connection with the abovementioned projects as well as certain other programs to be initiated during the year to rationalize headcount and optimize operations in a few select businesses we anticipate that much of the benefit of the 2013  and 2014  programs will be realized over the remainder of 2014  and into 2015 we also expect to fund the remainder of the 2013  programs currently underway as well those commenced in 2014  over the next 12 to 18 months in light of the economic uncertainty in certain of our end markets and our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2014  

2012  restructuring activities 

during 2012 we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts including targeted facility consolidations and headcount reductions at certain businesses as a result in 2012 we incurred restructuring charges totaling 194 million related to these programs as follows 

 

 

 

 

restructuring initiatives in 2011  were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations we incurred restructuring charges of 56 million  relating to such activities see note 9 restructuring activities  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional details regarding our recent restructuring activities 

segment results of operations 

  

this summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments energy engineered systems printing  identification and communication technologies each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets see note 17 segment information  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a reconciliation of segment revenue earnings and operating margin to our consolidated revenue earnings from continuing operations and operating margin segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

energy 

our energy segment serves the oil gas and power generation industries with products that promote the efficient and costeffective drilling extraction storage and movement of oil and gas products or constitute critical components for power generation equipment the energy segment operates through the following business lines production which comprises products and components facilitating the extraction and movement of fuel from the ground downstream which comprises systems and products that support the efficient safe and environmentallysensitive handling of fuel hazardous liquids and drybulk commodities and drilling which comprises products supporting the costeffective drilling of oil and gas wells 



2013  versus 2012   

energy segment revenue for the year increased   1239 million  a 57  increase over the prior year due to organic growth of 29  as well as acquisitionrelated growth of 34  slightly offset by a 06  impact from foreign currency translation acquisitionrelated growth was driven by the following the production control services and upco inc acquisitions that occurred in the second and fourth quarters of 2012 klaus enterprise ltd and spirit global energy solutions that occurred in the second and third quarters of 2013 and fibresec holdings ltd kungsors plast ab kps and lianyungang jump equipment co ltd acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013 

 

 

 

energy earnings in 2013   increased   142 million  or 26  primarily due to higher volume in the production and downstream sectors operating margin decreased 70 basis points due to unfavorable product mix and higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2013   increased   55  compared to 2012 primarily due to strong international growth offset in part by softer demand for winch products in the production sector backlog at december 31 2013  remained relatively stable as compared to the prior year decreasing 05  

2012  versus 2011   

revenue generated by our energy segment increased   2719 million  or 143  compared with 2011  the increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 94  growth from the acquisitions of production control services in april 2012 and oil lift in september 2011 totaling 53  and a negligible impact from foreign currency translation pricing actions mainly in response to increased raw material costs represented approximately 20 of the revenue increase 

 

 

 

 

energy earnings increased   880 million  or 195  primarily resulting from higher volume in the production and downstream sectors operating margin increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year due to improved operating leverage associated with higher volumes strategic pricing and productivity gains which more than offset the impact of unfavorable product mix and higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment is comprised of two platforms refrigeration  industrial and fluid solutions the refrigeration  industrial platform manufactures products and systems which serve two key endmarkets refrigeration  food equipment and other industrial the fluid solutions platform designs and manufactures pumps compressors and chemical proportioning and dispensing products 



2013  versus 2012   

engineered systems 2013  revenue increased   3772 million  or 110  driven by organic revenue growth of 14  and growth from recent acquisitions of 91  as well as a favorable foreign currency impact of less than 10 

 

 

 

 

engineered systems segment earnings in 2013   increased   739 million  or 147  compared with 2012  due to the impact of recent acquisitions favorable net material cost productivity improvements and a favorable foreign currency impact partially offset by weakened europe markets and higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization expense in addition nonrecurring gains in 2013 included a 68 million gain associated with the sale of land in switzerland and settlements on insurance related to property damage totaling 44 million that partially offset other miscellaneous nonrecurring charges none of which were individually significant operating margin increased 50 basis points compared to 2012  as the aforementioned pricing and productivity benefits and favorable net material costs more than offset acquisitionrelated costs 

segment bookings for 2013  and backlog at december 31 2013  increased compared to 2012  levels primarily from higher pump equipment refrigeration equipment and other industrial equipment orders 

2012  versus 2011 

engineered systems 2012  revenue increased 3188 million  or 103  driven by organic revenue growth of 56  and growth from recent acquisitions of 61  offset by a 14 unfavorable foreign currency impact

engineered systems segment earnings in 2012   increased   568 million  or 128  compared with 2011  due to the impact of recent acquisitions favorable net material cost and productivity improvements partially offset by weakened europe markets and unfavorable foreign currency impacts operating margin increased 30 basis points compared to 2011  as favorable pricing and productivity benefits more than offset acquisitionrelated costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

printing  identification 

our printing  identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking and coding printing dispensing soldering and coating equipment and related consumables and services the segment serves two broad global end markets fast moving consumer goods fmcg and industrial as discussed previously two businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets namely ect and dek were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 as we expected to divest these businesses the discussion that follows addresses only the remaining continuing operations of the segment 



2013  versus 2012   

printing  identification segment revenue increased   252 million  or 25  compared to 2012  attributable to organic growth of 24  and accretive contribution from acquisitions partially offset by a 02 unfavorable foreign currency impact 

 

 

p rinting  identification segment earnings increased   175 million  or 129  in 2013  compared to 2012  resulting in an operating margin increase of 130 basis points the margin increase is primarily attributed to leveraging higher volumes and ongoing productivity improvements including restructuring savings from actions taken earlier in 2013 and during 2012 

bookings for 2013   increased   24  as compared to 2012  and backlog levels at increased   22  at december 31 2013  compared to the prior year end primarily driven by our fmcg end markets 

2012  versus 2011 

  

printing  identification segment revenue decreased   117 million  or 12  compared to 2011  attributable to 24  organic revenue growth primarily driven by higher fmcg end market revenue more than offset by a 36 unfavorable foreign currency impact 

 

 

p rinting  identification segment earnings decreased   64 million  or 45  in 2012  compared to 2011  resulting in an operating margin decline of 40 basis points the margin decline is primarily attributed to lower industrial end market volumes key strategic investments for growth and restructuring expenses recognized in the first half of 2012 partially offset by ongoing productivity improvements and a partial year of restructuring savings 

communication technologies 

our communication technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components which serve the following key markets consumer electronics aerospacedefense medical technology and telecomother 



2013  versus 2012   

revenue generated by our communication technologies segment in 2013   increased   997 million  or 66  compared to 2012  the overall increase in revenue was mainly due to increased microelectronic mechanical “mems” microphone volumes resulting from new oem product introductions and overall smartphone market growth this growth was partially offset by the continued market decline of two oem customers affecting our speaker and receiver volumes and normal industry pricing concessions for our communications medical and telecommunications products revenue was favorably impacted by foreign currency translation by 02 

 

 

 

 

communication technologies earnings in 2013   increased   187 million  or 86  compared with 2012  with an increase in operating margin of 30 basis points the earnings and margin increases were driven by strong conversion on higher mems volumes savings from productivity programs and recent restructuring actions these increases more than offset the following higher depreciation and amortization expense of 159 million related to recent capital investments to support the growth in the handset market higher restructuring charges of 107 million fixed asset impairment and inventory charges of 52 million related to more mature product lines and normal industry pricing concessions corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities 

bookings increased 59 for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012 reflecting continued strength in our consumer electronics market and improved demand for medical coupling and connector products which more than offset reduced demand in our defense and hearing health markets backlog at december 31 2013  decreased 37 compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of new orders associated with marine hydraulics in the defense market 

2012  versus 2011   

revenue generated by our communication technologies segment increased   1565 million  or 115  compared with 2011  the overall increase in revenue resulted primarily from increased mems microphone volumes resulting from new product introductions and overall smart phone market growth combined with a full year of revenue for sound solutions in 2012 compared to six months of revenue in 2011 our mems revenue grew in excess of 250 over the 2011 level the 2012 revenue increase was partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives for our communications and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities and reduced volumes in certain end markets 

 

 

 

 

communication technologies 2012  earnings decreased   33  compared with 2011  with a decrease  in operating margin of 220  basis points the earnings and margin decreases were mainly due to lower margins from the integration of sound solutions including a full year of incremental depreciation and amortization compared to six months in 2011 new product ramp up costs and restructuring charges related to cost reduction activities offset in part by productivity initiatives leverage on higher mems volume and the absence of onetime acquisition related costs associated with the sound solutions 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased 825 million relative to 2012 this decline was driven by higher investments in working capital of 1317 million in 2013 relative to the prior year due primarily to the impact of timing of customer and vendor payments and higher revenue levels additionally we made higher longterm and annual incentive compensation payouts in 2013 which drove reductions in compensation accruals of nearly 667 million year over year increased tax payments of 574 million further reduced operating cash flow as these payments exceeded the 2013 tax provision thereby reducing income tax accruals offsetting these declines to operating cash flow were higher continuing earnings before depreciation and amortization of 1967 million which were the results of higher sales volumes and acquisition activity during the year 

cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased 3123 million as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased net earnings in 2012 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2011 higher sales volume increased 2012 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by 1270 million as compared with 2011 our net cash flow increased 1286 million on the change in working capital year over year as we converted working capital of approximately 309 million to cash in 2012 while we invested 977 million in working capital in 2011 additionally 2012 cash flow increased 767 million from the yearoveryear change in income tax accruals due to the timing of tax payments 

pension and postretirement activity   postretirement costs relating to pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans affect results in all segments as well as corporate we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 455 million  439 million  and 400 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit supplemental and postretirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding in 2013 we announced that the us qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans will be closed to new employees beginning in 2014 and that service benefits would be frozen effective 2024 consequently the net funded status of the us qualified defined benefit plan increased nearly 1250 million in 2013 relative to the prior year due to a reduction in expected future obligations and increased returns on plan assets we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements cash contributions to the us qualified defined benefit plan totaled 90 million 180 million and 420 million in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively due to the recent amendments to the us defined benefit plan the company expects to make minimal contributions to this plan in the near term 

our significant international pension plans maintained a net unfunded status of 956 million  at december 31 2013  as certain of these plans are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations 

the majority of the international obligations relate to defined benefit plans operated by our businesses in germany the united kingdom and switzerland total cash contributions to the international defined benefit pension plans in 2013  2012  and 2011  totaled 114 million 102 million and 73 million respectively in 2014 we expect to contribute approximately 89 million  to our nonus plans see note 15 employee benefit plans  in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital in 2013  adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased from 2012  by 1462 million or 101 to 16 billion which reflected an increase in receivables of 1332 million an increase in net inventory of 542 million and an increase in accounts payable of 412 million generally due to the impact of timing of customer and vendor payments in 2013 excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of 30 million adjusted working capital would have increased by 943 million or 65 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities are derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following 

 

 

 

 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make through the remainder of 2014 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper the use of established lines of credit or accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following 

 

 

 

 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

in 2013  our businesses reported as discontinued operations used cash flow of 300 million  as compared to cash generated of 49 million  and 1173 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively the 2011 amounts reflect cash flows generated from from the three businesses sold in 2011 paladin brands crenlo and heil trailer as well as cash flows from the two businesses reclassified as held for sale in 2012 dek and everett charles technologies cash flows from discontinued operations in 2013  and 2012   reflect only those businesses classified as held for sale in 2012 higher investments in working capital in 2013 led to the decline in cash flows from discontinued operations relative to the prior year due primarily to the timing of customer and vendor payments 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt pay dividends fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2013  we generated free cash flow of 9419 million  representing 108  of revenue and 975  of earnings from continuing operations free cash flow in 2012  was 9641 million  or 119  of revenue compared to 6862 million  or 93  of revenue in 2011  the full year decrease in 2013  free cash flow reflects a higher investment in working capital year over year offset by higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower capital expenditures we expect to generate free cash flow in 2014 of approximately 110 of revenue consistent with recent performance 

the 2012  increase in free cash flow compared to 2011  reflects higher earnings from continuing operations and lower investment in working capital partially offset by higher tax payments and increased capital expenditures in 2012  

  

net debt to net capitalization 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased slightly at december 31 2013  compared to the prior yearend due to the significant increase in equity levels driven by current net earnings offset in part by 284 million of additional net borrowings we replaced commercial paper borrowings in 2013 with the issuance of €3000 million  of 2125  eurodenominated notes due 2020 from which we received proceeds of approximately 4038 million  

our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december 31 2012  compared to the 2011  year end primarily due to the use of cash and borrowings to fund acquisitions totaling 10 billion  during the year total borrowings were higher by 6129 million at december 31 2012  primarily due to commercial paper issued in the fourth quarter to fund acquisitions 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock we currently maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to 10 billion and expires on november 10 2016 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a eurodollar or sterling rate based on libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 0565 to 1225 subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by sp and moody’s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility under this facility we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with 

this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2013  and had a coverage ratio of 132 to 10 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec with remaining capacity of 10 billion which we intend to renew that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2013  our cash and cash equivalents totaled 8039 million  of which approximately 6389 million was held outside the united states we typically invest cash in excess of nearterm requirements in shortterm investments we held no shortterm investments during 2012 or 2013 in 2011 we generated proceeds of 1244 million from the sale of shortterm investments which were liquidated to provide cash for 2011 acquisitions 

if our cash held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current law it would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2013  



shortterm ratings of p1 a1 and f1 are defined as a strong or superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations a longterm rating of a or a2 is defined as a strong capacity to meet financial commitments but susceptible to adverse business or economic conditions 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 1377 million  outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire at various dates in 2014  through 2018  these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2013  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2013  we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2013  yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2295 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries primarily in canada mexico substantially all of the european countries brazil argentina malaysia china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges and at december 31 2013  we had one outstanding floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of 500 million  in exchange for chf 651 million  which matures on october 15 2015 this transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in nonus operations the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings the fair values at december 31 2013  and 2012  reflected cumulative losses of 237 million  and 227 million  respectively due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 

additionally the company has designated the €3000 million  of eurodenominated notes issued december 4 2013 as a hedge of a portion of the its net investment in eurodenominated operations due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the eurodenominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment accordingly changes in the value of the eurodenominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in eurodenominated operations the loss recognized from the euro net investment hedge in other comprehensive income totaled 61 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing however such contracts outstanding at december 31 2013  were not significant 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 

 47 

performed in limited cases our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery installation testing certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized we do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements 

 

 

 

 48 

believe that we have established the proper reserves reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings changes in statutory tax rates and our future taxable income levels the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

 

 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements the company adopted this guidance on january 1 2012 and its adoption did not significantly impact the companys consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in 

stockholders’ equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this asu only requires a change in the format of the current presentation the company adopted this guidance for its 2011 yearend reporting presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings 

  

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current twostep test for goodwill impairment if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required this standard became effective for the company on january 1 2012 its adoption did not impact the companys consolidated financial statements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201109 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension plans the standard is intended to provide more information about an employer’s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates this guidance became effective for the company for its fiscal 2011 yearend reporting its adoption did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinitelived intangible asset per the terms of this asu an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the entity determines based on qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired the revised standard was effective for dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 its adoption did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 201302 which requires additional disclosures regarding the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 requires an entity to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 the company adopted this guidance effective january 1 2013 the companys adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in march 2013 the fasb issued asu 201305 which permits an entity to release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when a reporting entity parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity accordingly the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided or if a controlling financial interest is no longer held the revised standard is effective for dover for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 however early adoption is permitted the company does not expect adoption of this asu to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 which provides that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion thereof should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except to the extent that a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from disallowance of a tax position or the tax law does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose then the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability this standard is effective for dover for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 the company does not expect adoption of this asu to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow net debt total debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital earnings adjusted for nonrecurring items effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities debt or equity earnings revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings segment margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of free cash flow total debt and net debt can be found above in this item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers we believe that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called “working capital” which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes given the global nature of our businesses we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

the following table shows the percentage of total revenue and segment earnings generated by each of our four segments for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  



management philosophy 

our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital our operating structure of four business segments and two platforms allows for focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of our executive talent our segment and executive management set strategic direction initiatives and goals provide oversight allocate and manage capital are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services we foster an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness 

in addition we are committed to creating value for our customers employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and developing products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals our companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow 

company goals   

we are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives first we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth over the next three years  2013  through 2015  of 4 to 6 complemented by acquisition growth of 3 to 5 over the same period secondly we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives including supply chain activities strategic pricing and portfolio shaping we are targeting segment margins of approximately 19 by 2015 representing an increase of roughly 200 basis points over our 2012 segment margins lastly we are committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 10 through disciplined capital allocation strong performance productivity improvements and active working capital management we support these goals through 1 alignment of management compensation with financial objectives 2 welldefined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 talent development programs 

business strategy 

to achieve our goals we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies 

positioning ourselves for growth 

we have aligned our business segments to focus on keyend markets that are wellpositioned for future growth in particular our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on growth trends in the areas of global energy demand sustainability consumer product safety communications and emerging economies for instance our communication technologies segment is positioned to capitalize on growth in handheld communications handsets medical technology and aerospacedefense with its complement of micro audio components and communication components serving those markets our energy segment is driven by a growing demand for innovative extraction technologies the growing demand from emerging economies plus expanding exploration activity around the globe will provide significant opportunities for this segment our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies while our printing  identification segment is responding to the growing requirements for consumer product safety and traceability technologies by providing integrated printing coding and identification solutions with a global reach in the growing markets of fast moving consumer goods and industrial applications 

capturing the benefits of common ownership 

we are committed to operational excellence and have implemented various productivity initiatives such as supply chain management lean manufacturing and facility consolidations to maximize our efficiency coupled with workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees we foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization to ensure success our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets we have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in china brazil and india further we continue to make significant investments in talent development recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success 

disciplined capital allocation 

our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns to do this we grow and support our existing businesses with annual investment in capital spending approximating 35 of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets develop products and boost productivity we continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth spaces consumer electronics energy product id refrigeration and food equipment and fluid solutions we consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 57 years we will also continue to repurchase our shares per our previously announced share repurchase programs 

portfolio development 

acquisitions   

our acquisition program has two key elements first we seek to acquire value creating addon businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers or by broadening their product mix second in the right circumstances we will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces over the past three years  2010  – 2012  we have spent over 26 billion  to purchase 22  businesses that strategically fit within our business model this included the largest acquisition in our history that of sound solutions in july of 2011 for net purchase consideration of approximately 790 million by enhancing the product offerings serving the high growth handset market the acquisition of sound solutions has enabled our communication technologies segment to be a global leader in audio components serving this market in the fourth quarter of 2012 we spent approximately 600 million to acquire anthony international a leading manufacturer of specialty glass commercial glass refrigerator and freezer doors lighting systems and display equipment the acquisition of anthony expands our portfolio of industryleading technology in the refrigeration space and provides access to new geographies and new markets most notably the convenience store market recent significant acquisitions have also included harbisonfischer which we acquired for approximately 400 million at the beginning of 2011 in order to enhance our artificial lift portfolio within our energy segment maag pump systems a european acquisition for our fluid solutions platform which we acquired in the first quarter of 2012 for approximately 266 million and production control services acquired in the second quarter of 2012 for consideration totaling 220 million which added to our artificial lift technology in our energy segment 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 4  5 over a longterm business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal tool kit and defined processes to help ensure synergies are realized and value is created as had been planned when the acquisition was made 

dispositions   

we continually review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our longterm strategy occasionally we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations accordingly in an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces during the past three years  2010  – 2012  we have sold four  businesses for aggregate consideration of approximately 517 million  over the same period disposals of a few minor noncore divisions of our businesses generated additional proceeds of approximately 5 million  additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 we initiated the sale of two businesses in our printing  identification segment that serve the electronic assembly and test markets to reduce our exposure to these cyclical markets the financial position and results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented for more details see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

business segments 

as noted previously we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key endmarkets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments communication technologies energy engineered systems and printing  identification for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

communication technologies 

our communication technologies segment serves the following major markets consumer electronics medical technology aerospacedefense and telecomother 

 

 

 

 

communication technologies’ products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

energy 

our energy segment serves the oil gas and power generation industries with products that promote efficient and costeffective drilling extraction storage and movement of oil and gas products or constitute critical components for power generation equipment this segment consists of the following lines of business 

 

 

 

our energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels we manufacture our products primarily in north america and our sales are concentrated in north america with an increasing level of international sales directed largely to europe central and south america china the middle east and australia 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability consumer product safety needs and growth in emerging economies to better serve its endmarkets the segment manages its products and services through two core business platforms fluid solutions and refrigeration  industrial as described below 

fluid solutions 

the fluid solutions platform designs and manufactures pumps compressors and chemical proportioning and dispensing products the pumps and compressors are used to transfer liquid and bulk products and are sold to a wide variety of markets including the refined fuels lpg pulp and paper wastewater foodsanitary military transportation and chemical process industries the pumps include centrifugal reciprocating double diaphragm and rotary pumps that are used in demanding and specialized fluid transfer process applications the chemical portioning and dispensing systems are used to dilute and dispense concentrated cleaning chemicals and are sold to the food service health care supermarket institutional school building service contractor and industrial markets in addition the platform manufactures copperbrazed compact heat exchangers and designs software for heating and cooling substations fluid solutions products are manufactured in the united states south america asia and europe and marketed globally through direct channels and a network of distributors 

refrigeration  industrial 

the refrigeration  industrial platform manufactures products and systems serving the refrigeration and food equipment and other industrial markets as follows 

 

the majority of the refrigerationfood systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the refrigeration  industrial platform are used by the supermarket industry “bigbox” retail and convenience stores the commercialindustrial refrigeration industry institutional and commercial foodservice and food production markets and beverage canmaking industries the commercial foodservice cooking equipment products serve their markets worldwide through a network of dealers distributors national chain accounts manufacturer representatives and a direct sales force with the primary market being north america 

 

the businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps power clamps rotary and linear mechanical indexers conveyors pick and place units glove ports and manipulators as well as endofarm robotic grippers slides and end effectors these products serve a very broad market including food processing packaging paper processing medical electronic automotive nuclear and general industrial products they are produced in north america europe and asia and are marketed globally on a direct basis to oems and 

through a global dealer and distribution network to industrial end users we also provide highly engineered hydraulic cylinders and swivels to the north american markets for use in mining and resource recovery vehicle recovery materials handling and various other oem applications 

our businesses serving waste and recycling markets provide products and services for the refuse collection industry and for onsite processing and compaction of trash and recyclable materials products are sold to municipal customers national accounts and independent waste haulers through a network of distributors and directly in certain geographic areas the onsite waste management and recycling systems include a variety of stationary compactors wire processing and separation machines and balers that are manufactured and sold primarily in the united states to distribution centers malls stadiums arenas office complexes retail stores and recycling centers 

printing  identification 

our printing  identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking  coding printing dispensing soldering and coating equipment and related consumables and services the segment serves two broad global endmarkets fast moving consumer goods and industrial 

 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we reclassified to discontinued operations our businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets as we intend to divest these businesses in 2013 

printing  identification’s products are manufactured primarily in the united states france china and india and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum select other commodities and rare earth metals although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

research and development 

our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2012  we spent 189844  for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2011  and 2010  research and development spending totaled 175532  and 159338  respectively 

our communication technologies and printing  identification segments expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment and specialty electronic components for the consumer electronics medical technology and datacomtelecom markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the communication technologies and printing  identification segments 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

seasonality 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste and recycling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have longer lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

customers 

we serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2012  similarly within each of our four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of any individual segment’s revenue in 2012  except in our communication technologies segment where there is some revenue concentration with oem customers in the consumer electronics market given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are quite varied businesses supplying the waste and recycling agricultural defense energy automotive commercial refrigeration handset and hearing aid industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

certain of our businesses particularly within the communication technologies segment serve the military space aerospace commercial and telecom infrastructure markets their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers within the communication technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers and many of the largest global ems companies particularly in china 

backlog   

backlog is not a significant indicator of longterm performance as our products generally have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government 

contracts primarily in the aerospace and defense markets of our communication technologies segment our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as of december 31 2012  and 2011  was 15 billion  and 14 billion  respectively 

competition   

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition certain businesses in the communication technologies and printing  identification segments compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and east asia a summary of our key competitors by end market within each our segments follows 



international   

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia and eastern europe 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and with increasing emphasis canada china malaysia india mexico brazil and eastern europe 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 



our percentage of revenue derived from customers outside of the us declined slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of economic weakness in europe and slower growth in asia which impacted certain of our businesses 

our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in “item 1a risk factors” for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

environmental matters 

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

in 2010 we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions since then we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and have developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we also participated as a respondent in the 2012 carbon disclosure project 

all of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers including but not limited to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass through” costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

employees   

we had approximately 35000  employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2012  which was an increase of 13  from the prior year end the increase is primarily the result of recent acquisitions slightly offset by headcount reduction programs in certain businesses 

iran related activities 

pursuant to section 13r of the securities exchange act of 1934 we are required to provide disclosure if during 2012 we or any of our affiliates have engaged in transactions or dealings with the government of iran that have not been specifically authorized by a us federal department or agency 

during the disclosure period automatik plastics machinery gmbh automatik a german affiliate of maag pump systems which we acquired on march 13 2012 exported from germany europeanorigin equipment used in the processing of polystyrene pellets and pet chip to two entities in iran tabriz petrochemical “tabriz” and shahid tondgoyan petrochemical “shahid tondgoyan” which we understand are owned or controlled by the government of iran all of the exports except one were made prior to august 10 2012 the date of enactment of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 “itra” automatik made two exports to tabriz on february 24 2012 and may 8 2012 with total revenue and net profit values of €51550 and €14759 respectively automatik made three exports to shahid tondgoyan on march 6 2012 july 19 2012 and august 8 2012 with total revenue and net profit values of €516831 and €162588 respectively the only export made after the enactment of the itra was made to shahid tondgoyan on october 4 2012 with a revenue and net profit value of €20388 and €7411 respectively this last export was made prior to the october 9 2012 date of the presidential executive order that made it a 

violation of us law for owned or controlled foreign subsidiaries after october 9 2012 to knowingly engage in transactions with the government of iran or any person subject to the jurisdiction of the government of iran for most of these exports automatik received official written confirmation from the german government that it did not require a license under german law and for the others it received oral confirmation no license was required automatik also received a payment in november 2012 for a prior order that was not shipped and will not be shipped in the future given the sec guidance that issuers should disclose all activities including those taking place prior to itras enactment on august 10 2012 we are including all exports by automatik germany to government entities in iran during 2012 management has instructed all of the companys nonus affiliates not to engage in any trade transactions with iran 

other information 

we make available through the “financial reports” link on our internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed 

 

our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce 

our energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact production although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands 

negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

 

approximately 46  of our revenues for 2012  and 47  of our revenues for 2011  were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations including 



if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences and pricing pressures if our businesses 

are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

certain of our communication technologies businesses sell their products in electronic and technologybased industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive in these industries they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands if these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes it could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” requirement for disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined in the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries it is possible that some of our businesses customers will require “conflict free” metals in products purchased from us we have begun the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses as required by the doddfrank act the supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors we may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers manufacturing operations and operating profits 

  

the need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts lead to supply shortages or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods 

 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws including environmental and exportimport laws regulations and policies failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates in addition we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid 

can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

  

 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated or may expose us to unexpected liabilities further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations if we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot be assured that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

 

our growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions if we are unsuccessful in these efforts our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

 

our businesses rely on a number of information technologies to manage store and support business activities we have put in place a number of systems processes and practices designed to protect against intentional or unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information disruption of our operations or corruption of the software that supports our products disruptions or cybersecurity attacks such as unauthorized access malicious software or other violations may lead to exposure of proprietary or confidential information as well as potential data corruption any intrusion may cause operational stoppages violations of applicable law diminished competitive advantages or reputational damages and increased operational costs for remedial activities 

  

 

while we strive to maintain high standards we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws or fail to protect our confidential information including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy laws as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits and could damage our reputation 

  

 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations which are presented in us dollars a significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lowercost locations and sold in various countries crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling swiss franc chinese rmb yuan and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries such as china our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our longterm debt as of december 31 2012  although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings if our current credit ratings deteriorate then our borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under our fiveyear credit facility and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

a few of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and it is anticipated to be immaterial to us on a consolidated basis in addition a few of our subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established at december 31 2012  and 2011  we have reserves totaling 289  million and 196  million respectively for environmental matters that are probable and estimable with the 2012 increase primarily attributed to environmental contingencies assumed in recent acquisitions 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to our businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of the use of our businesses products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance coverage and established reserves at december 31 2012  and 2011  we have reserves totaling 12  million for legal matters that are probable and estimable and not otherwise covered by insurance while it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions in the opinion of management based on the aforementioned reviews we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings which individually or in the aggregate could have a material affect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview and outlook 

dover is a diversified global manufacturer focusing on innovative equipment and components specialty systems and support services provided through its four major operating segments communication technologies energy engineered systems and printing  identification the companys entrepreneurial business model encourages promotes and fosters deep customer engagement which has led to dovers wellestablished and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industryleading product innovation 

overall 2012 concluded as a solid performance year with strong revenue earnings and cash flow growth despite the backdrop of a lowgrowth macroeconomic environment our consolidated revenue increased 735 million or 10 to 81 billion inclusive of acquisitions and our gross profit increased by 262 million or 9 to 31 billion the 2012 results were led by our strong positions in the energy handset refrigeration and food equipment and other industrial markets 

in our energy segment expanding production activity and strong downstream investments in distribution and retail fueling are among the trends that drove solid results during the year the strong production and downstream performance was partially offset by the softening north american rig count which caused our yearoveryear drilling end market comparisons to decline as the year progressed in all the segment had solid performance characterized by continuing growth and strong margins we expect this trend to continue in 2013 

within our communication technologies segment several oems launched new products in the handset market during the second quarter and our microelectronic mechanical mems microphone activity was very strong once the new oem product launches commenced however our 2012 performance at sound solutions was weaker than anticipated the sound solutions business continued to work through operational challenges which led to lower volumes than anticipated for the year however they did experience sequential growth and margin improvement in the fourth quarter relative to the earlier quarters and we expect their performance to continue to improve in 2013 overall we expect the handset market to be strong in 2013 supported by numerous new product releases coupled with the increased use of multiple microphones per handset our aerospacedefense and medical technology markets were solid during the year while our telecom market continued to be weak 

within our engineered systems segment the refrigeration and food equipment markets were solid as were most of our us industrial end markets the results of our fluid solutions platform continued to reflect good performance from our first quarter maag pump systems acquisition which helped to mitigate the impact of a weakened market in europe we expect 2013 to be another solid year for engineered systems as we leverage our recent acquisitions and continue our geographic expansion within our fluid solutions platform we anticipate customer wins an active remodel market expanded product offerings and recent acquisitions to drive 2013 growth within our refrigeration  industrial platform 

in our printing  identification segment solid organic growth in our fast moving consumer goods market more than offset uneven demand in our industrial markets which was impacted by weak europe and slowing china markets we anticipate the release of several new products in the first half of the year traction of added sales and service resources in key regional markets along with stable fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets to contribute to our 2013 growth margin performance in the segment steadily improved over the course of 2012 driven by productivity and restructuring activities we expect incremental benefit from these activities to carry over into 2013 enabling continued reinvestment in our product identification growth space 

in addition to our solid financial results we continued to execute on our corporate strategy during 2012 we continued to focus on our five key growth spaces of communication components energy fluids refrigeration and food equipment and product identification we invested 12 billion on seven acquisitions that expanded our markets enhanced our product offerings and broadened our customer base in advancing our strategy of focusing on our higher margin growth spaces we have reclassified to discontinued operations two noncore businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets we expect to divest these businesses in 2013 although solid performers these businesses serve highly volatile endmarkets and their sale should improve the consistency of our future results and enable management to focus on our key growth spaces in 2012 we generated 964 million in free cash flow which enabled us to continue to invest in higher growth economies and innovation and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend now standing at 57 consecutive years lastly in november of 2012 we announced and began to execute on a 1 billion share repurchase program to continue to drive longterm shareholder value 

with respect to our expectations for 2013 we are targeting full year organic growth in the range of 3 to 5 inclusive of a negligible foreign exchange impact and acquisition related growth of approximately 4 for acquisitions completed in 2012 based on these revenue assumptions our profitability expectations and anticipated additional share buybacks our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2013 is estimated to be in the range of 505 to 535 and we expect our earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters if global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate our operating results for 2013 could be materially different than currently projected 

consolidated results of operations 

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k in the fourth quarter of 2012  we reclassified certain businesses in the printing  identification segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses the results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and are presented within results of discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

  

revenue 

our 2012 consolidated revenue increased 10 to 81 billion reflecting organic growth of 5 growth from acquisitions of 6 and an unfavorable impact from currency translation of 1 all four of our segments generated 2012 organic revenue growth with the majority attributed to volume increases driven by strength in the energy handset refrigeration and food equipment and many of the other industrial markets served by our engineered systems segment approximately 3 of our growth was generated by new products particularly in our communication technologies segment and geographic market expansion in our energy segment pricing had a negligible impact to 2012 revenue as price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs were partly offset by lower strategic pricing initiatives revenues generated outside of the us increased by 9 compared with 2011 with growth in canada and asia offsetting weakness in europe 

over 80 of the 2012 revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by sound solutions maag pump systems and production control services three of our more significant recent acquisitions made in the second half of 2011 and first half of 2012 

our 2011 consolidated revenue increased 13 billion or 21 compared with 2010 reflecting organic growth of 12 growth from acquisitions of 7 and a favorable impact from currency translation of 2 the majority of our 2011 organic growth was attributed to increased volumes across all four segments driven by strength in the energy and consumer handset markets and solid growth in fluid solutions refrigeration equipment and many of the industrial markets served by our engineered systems segment additionally approximately 2 of our growth was generated by new products particularly in our communication technologies and printing  identification segments pricing added about 1 to revenue principally driven by strategic pricing initiatives and price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs revenues generated outside of the us increased by 25 compared with 2010 with revenue generated in emerging economies of china and latin america increasing 56 

over 70 of the 2011 revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by harbisonfischer and sound solutions two large acquisitions that we made in 2011 to expand our operations serving the artificial lift and handset markets respectively 

gross profit 

our gross profit increased 2623 million or 9 in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes favorable net material costs and benefits from productivity initiatives gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 30 basis points in 2012 to 383 from 386 in 2011 with the reduction in large part due to the integration of sound solutions which generated lower than anticipated revenue in 2012 more than offsetting the operating leverage achieved by our other businesses 

our gross profit increased 4222 million or 17 in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes however gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 110 basis points in 2011 to 386 from 397 in 2010 due principally to the impact of product and customer mix which more than offset operating leverage as well as the impact of higher depreciation from recent acquisitions 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 1207 million or 7 in 2012 compared with 2011 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses declined to 227 in 2012 compared with 234 in 2011 this 70 basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels which more than offset higher acquisitionrelated amortization and increased restructuring charges 

selling and administrative expenses increased 2214 million or 15 in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses declined to 234 in 2011 compared with 245 in 2010 this 110 basis point improvement was largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels which more than offset higher amortization and other nonrecurring expenses related to recent acquisitions 

nonoperating items 

interest expense net increased 56 million or 5 to 1211 million in 2012 primarily due to lower average levels of cash on hand at reduced interest rates leading to 44 million less of interest income in 2012 as compared with 2011 

in 2011 our interest expense net increased 9 to 1156 million due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings during 2011 as compared with 2010 as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k in february of 2011 we issued 800 million in new notes receiving net proceeds of 789 million approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire 400 million of notes which came due earlier that month with the remainder used to fund first quarter 2011 acquisitions as a result our total borrowings were 380 million higher at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010 

other expense income net in 2012 2011 and 2010 includes 95 million 75 million and 69 million respectively of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency offset in each of these years by royalty income and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains and losses none of which are individually significant in 2010 other expense income net also includes a 43 million loss on extinguishment of debt relating to early settlement of a noninterest bearing structured loan arrangement 

income taxes 

we operate globally and 38 43 and 47 of our pretax earnings in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively were generated in foreign jurisdictions where such earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are well below the 35 us statutory rate we also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as a result our blended effective tax rate is typically significantly lower than the us statutory rate 

the 2012 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 268 compared to the 2011 rate of 235 the 2012 and 2011 rates were favorably impacted by net discrete items principally settlements with us federal and state taxing authorities totaling 161 million and 407 million respectively after adjusting for discrete items the effective tax rates were 282 and 275 for 2012 and 2011 respectively the higher prediscrete rate in 2012 reflects the impact of a higher proportion of us earnings partly offset by lower effective tax rates on earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions 

the 2010 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 238 the effective tax rate in 2010 was also favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling 503 million arising principally from settlements with the us federal taxing authority coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter after adjusting for discrete and other items the effective tax rate for 2010 was 30 which was higher than the adjusted effective tax rate for 2011 of 275 due primarily to the geographic mix of earnings with a greater proportion of our nonus earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions having higher tax rates than in 2011 when more of the nonus earnings were generated in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates on average 

we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits this decrease may result in an income tax benefit due to the potential for resolution of federal state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to 140 million some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 

earnings from continuing operations 

earnings from continuing operations increased 8 to 8331 million or 453 diluted earnings per share eps in 2012 compared with earnings from continuing operations of 7732 million or 409 eps in 2011 the increase in 2012 earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives offset in part by higher acquisitionrelated expenses and increased restructuring charges relative to 2011 the eps increase reflects the increase in earnings as well as the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding for the 2012 period relative to 2011 as discussed in the financial condition section of this mda we have repurchased incrementally more common shares in 2012 as compared to 2011 

earnings from continuing operations increased 25 to 7732 million or 409 eps in 2011 compared with earnings from continuing operations of 6195 million or 327 eps in 2010 the increase in 2011 dollar earnings and eps from continuing operations was primarily the result of higher revenues and the lower effective tax rate relative to 2010 

  

discontinued operations 

we did not dispose of any businesses in 2012 however in the fourth quarter we announced our intent to divest everett charles technologies including the multitest business collectively ect and dek international dek two noncore businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented herein in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 638 million 519 million net of tax in connection with the intended divestiture of ect as a result in 2012 we generated a net aftertax loss from discontinued operations of 220 million or a loss of 012 eps reflecting 300 million of net earnings from the operations of these businesses along with minor adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities which were more than offset by the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge 

we sold three businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and the operations of these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2011 our net earnings from discontinued operations for 2011 totaled 1221 million or 065 eps and includes net earnings of 1007 million from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 and held for sale in 2012 coupled with tax benefits of 180 million and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities net earnings from discontinued operations also includes a 47 million loss on the 2011 sale of the three businesses inclusive of goodwill impairment 

for 2010 our net earnings from discontinued operations totaled 806 million or 043 eps and includes net earnings of 807 million from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 and held for sale in 2012 coupled with adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities offset in part by a net loss of 142 million relating to the sale of a business that had been reflected as a discontinued operation in a previous year refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations 

restructuring activities 

2012 restructuring activities 

during the year we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts including targeted facility consolidations and headcount reductions at certain businesses as a result in 2012 we incurred restructuring charges totaling 194 million related to these programs as follows 

 

 

 

 

we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately 20 to 30 million in 2013 in connection with the abovementioned projects as well as certain other programs to be initiated during the year to rationalize headcount and optimize operations in a few select businesses we anticipate that a significant portion of the 2013 charges will be incurred in the first quarter with much of the benefit of the 2012 and 2013 programs being realized over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 we also expect to fund the remainder of the 2012 programs currently underway as well those commenced in 2013 over the next 12 to 18 months in light of the economic uncertainty in certain of our end markets and our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2013 

2011 and 2010 restructuring activities 

restructuring initiatives in 2011 and 2010 were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations we incurred restructuring charges of 56 million and 59 million respectively relating to such activities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional details regarding our recent restructuring activities 

segment results of operations 

  

this summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments communication technologies energy engineered systems and printing  identification each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a reconciliation of segment revenue earnings and operating margin to our consolidated revenue earnings from continuing operations and operating margin segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin which are presented in the segment discussion that follows are nongaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

communication technologies 

our communication technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components which serve the following key markets consumer electronics medical technology aerospacedefense and telecomother for the reporting within this form 10k and on a goforward basis we have condensed our end market analysis into the four abovementioned markets reduced from the analysis of five end markets in our prior annual and quarterly reporting therefore all prior year revenue information has been recast to be consistent with the current endmarket designations 



2012  versus 2011   

revenue generated by our communication technologies segment in 2012 increased by 1565 million or 12 compared to the same period of 2011 the overall increase in revenue resulted primarily from increased microelectronic mechanical “mems” microphone volumes stemming from new product introductions and overall smart phone market growth combined with a full year of revenue for sound solutions in 2012 compared to six months of revenue in 2011 our mems revenue grew in excess of 25 over the 2011 level the 2012 revenue increase was partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives for our communications and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities and reduced volumes in certain end markets 

 

 

 

 

communication technologies earnings in 2012 decreased 74 million or 3 compared with 2011 with a decrease in operating margin of 220 basis points the earnings and margin decreases were mainly due to lower margins from the integration of sound solutions including a full year of incremental depreciation and amortization compared to six months in 2011 new product ramp up costs and restructuring charges related to cost reduction activities offset in part by productivity initiatives leverage on higher mems volume and the absence of onetime acquisition related costs associated with the sound solutions 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2012 and backlog at december 31 2012 indicate continued strength across each of our end markets with the exception of our telecommunicationother market 

2011  versus 2010   

revenue generated by our communication technologies segment increased 2841 million or 26 compared with 2010 with 1902 million or 18 of the growth attributed principally to the 2011 acquisition of sound solutions which supplemented our product offerings in the growing handset market our organic revenue growth of 7 was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the consumer electronics market which grew significantly year over year although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to strategic pricing initiatives for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains new product introductions and product mix 

 

 31 

 

 

communication technologies 2011 earnings increased 10 compared with 2010 but operating margin declined 250 basis points the margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization higher raw material costs and lower margins from the integration of the sound solutions acquisition excluding the impact of sound solutions earnings would have increased by 366 million or 18 and operating margin would have increased by 160 basis points as compared with 2010 

energy 

our energy segment serves the oil gas and power generation industries with products that promote efficient and costeffective drilling extraction storage and movement of oil and gas products or constitute critical components for power generation equipment the energy segment operates through the following business lines drilling which comprises products supporting the costeffective drilling of oil and gas wells production which comprises products and components facilitating the extraction and movement of fuel from the ground and downstream which comprises systems and products that support the efficient safe and environmentallysensitive handling of fuel hazardous liquids and drybulk commodities 



2012  versus 2011   

our 2012 energy segment revenue increased 2719 million or 14 compared to 2011 the increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 9 growth from the acquisitions of production control services in april 2012 and oil lift in september 2011 totaling 5 and a negligible impact from foreign currency translation pricing actions mainly in response to increased raw material costs represented approximately 2 of the revenue increase 

 

 

 

 

energy earnings in 2012 increased 880 million or 20 primarily resulting from higher volume in the production and downstream sectors operating margin increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year due to improved operating leverage associated with higher volumes strategic pricing and productivity gains which more than offset the impact of unfavorable product mix and higher acquisitionrelated depreciation and amortization 

bookings for the year ended december 31 2012 and backlog at december 31 2012 increased 11 and 4 respectively compared to the prior year periods we expect market conditions in 2013 to moderate compared to 2012 with continued geographic expansion and further penetration of new and acquired products and technologies are also expected to contribute to our growth in 2013 

2011  versus 2010   

our energy segment posted record organic revenue earnings and bookings in 2011 revenue and earnings were up 46 and 43 respectively due to continued strength in the drilling production and downstream energy markets served by the segment recent acquisitions generated revenue growth of 19 and contributed to the segment’s record results sales outside of north america grew 35 driven by significantly higher sales to central and south america the middle east and russia pricing actions generally undertaken to offset commodity inflation accounted for a marginal portion of the revenue increase 

 

 

 

 33 

energy earnings increased 1345 million or 43 from the higher organic and acquisition volumes energy operating margin declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year due to the impact of acquisitionrelated costs including higher depreciation and amortization and higher material costs partially offset by improved operating leverage associated with the higher volumes strategic pricing and productivity gains 

engineered systems 

our engineered systems segment is comprised of two platforms fluid solutions and refrigeration  industrial the fluid solutions platform designs and manufactures pumps compressors and chemical proportioning and dispensing products the refrigeration  industrial platform manufactures products and systems which serve two key endmarkets refrigeration  food equipment and other industrial 



2012  versus 2011   

engineered systems 2012 revenue increased 3188 million or 10 driven by organic revenue growth of 6 and growth from recent acquisitions of 6 offset by a 2 unfavorable foreign currency impact 

 

 

 

 

engineered systems segment earnings in 2012 increased 568 million or 13 compared with 2011 due to the impact of recent acquisitions favorable net material cost and productivity improvements partially offset by weakened europe markets and unfavorable foreign currency impacts operating margin increased 30 basis points compared to 2011 as favorable pricing and productivity benefits more than offset acquisitionrelated costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

segment bookings for 2012 and backlog at december 31 2012 increased compared to 2011 levels primarily from higher pump equipment orders associated with maag our 2012 refrigeration  industrial yearend backlog level declined slightly compared to 2011 which included significant refrigeration bookings for targets pfresh remodeling project which is nearing completion 

2011  versus 2010 

engineered systems 2011 revenue increased 11 driven by organic revenue growth of 9 favorable foreign currency of 1 and a negligible impact from recent acquisitions 

 

 

 

 

engineered systems segment earnings increased 625 million or 16 on the strength of increased volume operating margin expanded by 70 basis points as a result of positive pricing actions and productivity savings which more than offset cost escalation and unfavorable product mix 

printing  identification 

our printing  identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking and coding printing dispensing soldering and coating equipment and related consumables and services the segment serves two broad global end markets fast moving consumer goods fmcg and industrial as discussed previously two businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets namely ect and dek were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 as we expect to divest these businesses in 2013 the discussion that follows addresses only the remaining continuing operations of the segment 



2012  versus 2011   

printing  identification segment revenue decreased 117 million or 1 compared to 2011 attributable to 2 organic revenue growth primarily driven by higher fmcg end market revenue more than offset by a 3 unfavorable foreign currency impact 

 

 

p rinting  identification segment earnings declined 64 million or 5 in 2012 compared to 2011 resulting in an operating margin decline of 40 basis points the margin decline is primarily attributed to lower industrial end market volumes key strategic investments for growth and restructuring expenses recognized in the first half of 2012 partially offset by ongoing productivity improvements and a partial year of restructuring savings 

bookings for 2012 decreased 2 as compared to 2011 principally due to unfavorable currency while backlog levels at december 31 2012 increased 4 compared to the prior year end 

2011  versus 2010 

  

printing  identification segment 2011 revenue increased 646 million or 7 compared with 2010 with over 3 organic revenue growth and 35 favorable foreign currency impact 

 

 

printing  identification segment earnings declined 97 million in 2011 compared to 2010 resulting in an operating margin decline of 200 basis points the margin decline is primarily attributed to unfavorable regional mix and new product introduction costs we also completed several small employee reduction in force programs across targeted businesses to streamline operations and to align more closely with our growth in geographic end markets costs related to these programs were not significant 

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchase of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased 3123 million primarily due to increased net earnings in 2012 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2011 higher sales volume increased 2012 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by 127 million as compared with 2011 our net cash flow increased 129 million on the change in working capital yearoveryear as we converted working capital of approximately 31 million to cash in 2012 while we invested 98 million in working capital in 2011 additionally 2012 cash flow increased 77 million from the yearoveryear change in income tax accruals in 2012 our tax provision exceeded our payments leading to an increase in the accrued tax balance while in 2011 we made tax payments in excess of the 2011 provision in part due to 2011 settlement activity which reduced the accrued tax balance 

cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased 1186 million primarily due to increased earnings in 2011 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2010 higher sales volume increased 2011 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by 215 million as compared with 2010 our investment in working capital was 59 million lower than in 2010 at which time a working capital buildup was necessary to support revenue levels recovering from the 2009 declines these increases in cash flow were partially offset by 170 million of higher income tax payments resulting from our higher earnings and 2011 tax settlement activity as well as higher employee incentive compensation payments and reductions in deferred revenue 

pension and postretirement activity   postretirement costs relating to pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans affect results in all segments we recorded net periodic benefit costs of 44 million 40 million and 33 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit supplemental and postretirement plans the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including discount rates used to value plan obligations expected returns on plan assets the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses in 2012 the actual return on plan assets increased consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets in 2011 the actual return on us plan assets increased while returns on our nonus plans declined as a result of the different mix of investments in the plans in 2013 we expect our net periodic benefit cost to be approximately 60 million with the increase compared to 2012 being attributed to the lower discount rates used to value the postretirement obligations higher amortization relating to unrecognized asset losses and an increase in participants in our supplemental retirement plans 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and the level of funding we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements at december 31 2012 the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit plans reflected underfunding by 153 million which includes 49 million relating to the us dover corporate pension plan and 103 million relating to our significant international pension plans some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations the majority of the international obligations relate 

to defined pension plans operated by our businesses in germany the united kingdom and switzerland cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2012 2011 and 2010 totaled 28 million 49 million and 38 million respectively in 2013 we expect to contribute 20 to 40 million to our us qualified defined benefit plan and approximately 14 million to our nonus plans see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

adjusted working capital in 2012 adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased from 2011 by 111 million or 8 to 14 billion which reflected an increase in receivables of 107 million an increase in net inventory of 139 million and an increase in accounts payable of 135 million generally due to the impact of 2012 acquisitions excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of 11 million adjusted working capital would have decreased by 30 million or 2 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities results from cash outflows for capital expenditures acquisitions and shortterm investments partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses property plant and equipment and shortterm investments in 2012 we used cash in investing activities of 13 billion compared to 10 billion in 2011 driven by the following factors 

 we anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make through the remainder of 2013 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper the use of established lines of credit or accessing the public debt or equity markets 

financing activities 

our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options for 2012 we used cash of 343 million for financing activities compared to 51 million in 2011 with the activity attributed to the following 

 cash flows from discontinued operations 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 our businesses reported as discontinued operations generated cash flow of 5 million 117 million and 100 million respectively the 2011 and 2010 amounts reflect cash flows from the three businesses sold in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 as well as cash flows from the two businesses reclassified to discontinued operations in 2012 the significant decrease in 2012 cash flows from discontinued operations relative to the prior years reflects a significant decrease in 2012 earnings from the businesses reclassified in 2012 as well as the the absence of cash flows from the businesses sold in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt pay dividends fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

for 2012 we generated free cash flow of 9641 million representing 119 of revenue and 1157 of earnings from continuing operations while continuing to make investments necessary to support our growth free cash flow in 2011 was 6862 million or 93 of revenue compared to 6610 million or 108 of revenue in 2010 the increase in 2012 free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and a 129 million positive change in working capital yearoveryear offset in part by higher capital expenditures in 2012 necessary to fund expansion in the company’s highgrowth businesses we expect to generate free cash flow in 2013 of approximately 10 of revenue consistent with our historical performance 

the 2011 increase in free cash flow compared to 2010 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations and lower investment in working capital partially offset by higher tax payments and increased capital expenditures in 2011 

  

net debt to net capitalization 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 



our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december 31 2012 compared to the prior yearend primarily due to the use of cash and borrowings to fund acquisitions totaling 10 billion during the year total borrowings are higher by 613 million at december 31 2012 primarily due to commercial paper issued in the fourth quarter to fund acquisitions we expect to replace these commercial paper borrowings with longterm fixed rate notes in 2013 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december 31 2011 compared to the 2010 year end primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling 14 billion during the year total net borrowings increased by 380 million during 2011 primarily due to 789 million net proceeds received from the 43 10year notes due 2021 and 5375 30year notes due 2041 issued in february approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire 400 million of notes which came due earlier in february 2011 in 2011 we also received cash proceeds of 517 million primarily from the sale of three businesses 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock we currently maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to 1 billion and expires on november 10 2016 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a eurodollar or sterling rate based on libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 0565 to 1225 subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by sp and moody’s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility under this facility we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2012 and had a coverage ratio of 139 to 1 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec with remaining capacity of 1 billion that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2012 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 800 million of which approximately 700 million was held outside the united states cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less we regularly invest cash in excess of nearterm requirements in shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months up to twelve months we held no shortterm investments at december 31 2012 or 2011 

if our cash held outside of the us were to be repatriated under current law it would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs including its cash needs in the united states 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2012  



we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 967 million  outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire at various dates in 2013 through 2017  these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2012  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 



 



financial instruments and risk management 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2012  we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2012 yearend fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 250 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries primarily in canada mexico substantially all of the european countries brazil argentina malaysia china india and other asian countries therefore we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs we have not had material foreign currency hedging activity in recent years 

changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars our reporting currency the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges and at december 31 2012  we had one outstanding floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of 50 million  in exchange for chf 651 million  which matures on october 15 2015 this transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in nonus operations the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings the fair values at december 31 2012  and 2011  reflected cumulative losses of 227 million  and 217 million  respectively due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 

commodity price exposure 

certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as aluminum steel copper and various precious metals among others our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials when possible we maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing however we had no such contracts outstanding at december 31 2012 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis

recently adopted accounting standards 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements the company adopted this guidance on january 1 2012 and its adoption did not significantly impact the companys consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this asu only requires a change in the format of the current presentation the company adopted this guidance for its 2011 yearend reporting presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings 

  

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current twostep test for goodwill impairment if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required this standard became effective for the company on january 1 2012 its adoption did not impact the companys consolidated financial statements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201109 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension plans the standard is intended to provide more information about an employer’s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates this guidance became effective for the company for its fiscal 2011 yearend reporting its adoption did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinitelived intangible asset per the terms of this asu an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the entity determines based on qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired the revised standard is effective for dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 the company does not expect adoption of this asu to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors segment ebitda segment ebitda margin free cash flow net debt total debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital earnings adjusted for nonrecurring items effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities debt or equity earnings revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings segment margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 

we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of free cash flow total debt and net debt can be found above in this item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers we believe that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called “working capital” which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes given the global nature of our businesses we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10 of revenue we are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns to do this we grow and support our existing businesses with annual investment in capital spending approximating 3 of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets develop products and boost productivity we continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth spaces communication components energy product id refrigeration and food equipment and fluid solutions we consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends which have increased annually over each of the last 56 years we will also continue to repurchase our shares principally to cover market dilution 

 

portfolio development 

 

acquisitions 

 

our acquisition program has two key elements first we seek to acquire value creating addon businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customer mix or by broadening their product mix second in the right circumstances we will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces over the past three years 2009 – 2011 we have spent over 17 billion to purchase 21 businesses that strategically fit within our business model this included the largest acquisition in our history that of sound solutions in july of 2011 for approximately 800 million by enhancing the product offerings serving the high growth handset market the acquisition of sound solutions has enabled our communication technologies segment to be a global leader in audio components serving this market at the beginning of 2011 in order to build out our artificial lift portfolio within our energy segment we spent approximately 400 million to acquire harbisonfischer a designer and manufacturer of downhole rod pumps and related products used in artificial lift applications around the world 

 

  

  

  

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while we expect to generate annual organic growth of 4  5 over a business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure to track postmerger integration and accountability we utilize an internal tool kit and defined processes to ensure synergies are realized and value is created 

 

dispositions 

  

we continually review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our longterm growth strategy occasionally we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations accordingly in an effort to focus on our higher margin growth spaces during the past three years 2009  2011 we have sold four businesses for aggregate consideration of approximately  517 million  the financial position and results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations for more details see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k over the same period disposals of a few minor noncore divisions of our businesses generated additional proceeds of approximately 8 million   

business segments 

 

as noted previously in the fourth quarter of 2011 we reorganized our businesses into four new business segments that are aligned with the key endmarkets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments communication technologies energy engineered systems and printing  identification for financial information about our segments and geographic areas see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k all information set forth within this annual report has been recast to reflect the new segmentation 

 

communication technologies 

 

our communication technologies segment serves the following major markets communications life sciences aerospaceindustrial defense and telecommunicationother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communication technologies’ products are manufactured primarily in north america europe and asia and are sold globally directly and through a network of distributors 

 

  

table of contents   

  

energy 

 

our energy segment serves the oil gas and power generation industries with products that promote the efficient and costeffective drilling extraction storage and movement of oil and gas products or constitute critical components for power generation equipment this segment consists of the following lines of business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our energy segment’s sales are made directly to customers and through various distribution channels we manufacture our products primarily in north america and our sales are concentrated in north america with an increasing level of international sales directed largely to europe south america and the middle east 

  

engineered systems 

 

our engineered systems segment combines its engineering technology unique product advantages and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability consumer product safety needs and growth in emerging economies to better serve its endmarkets the segment manages its products and services through two core business platforms fluid solutions and refrigeration  industrial as described below 

 

fluid solutions 

 

the fluid solutions platform designs and manufactures pumps compressors and chemical proportioning and dispensing products the pumps and compressors are used to transfer liquid and bulk products and are sold to a wide variety of markets including the refined fuels lpg pulp and paper wastewater foodsanitary military transportation and chemical process industries the pumps include centrifugal reciprocating double diaphragm and rotary pumps that are used in demanding and specialized fluid transfer process applications the chemical portioning and dispensing systems are used to dilute and dispense concentrated cleaning chemicals and are sold to the food service health care supermarket institutional school building service contractor and industrial markets in addition the platform manufactures copperbrazed compact heat exchangers and designs software for heating and cooling substations fluid solutions products are manufactured in the united states south america asia and europe and marketed globally through a network of distributors or via direct channels 

 

  

  

refrigeration  industrial 

 

the refrigeration  industrial platform manufactures products and systems serving the refrigerationfood waste and recycling and other niche industrial markets as follows 

 

 

 

the majority of the refrigerationfood systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the refrigeration  industrial platform are used by the supermarket industry “bigbox” retail and convenience stores the commercialindustrial refrigeration industry institutional and commercial foodservice and food production markets and beverage canmaking industries the commercial foodservice cooking equipment products serve their markets worldwide through a network of dealers distributors national chain accounts manufacturer representatives and a direct sales force with the primary market being north america 

 

 

 

 

 

the businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps power clamps rotary and linear mechanical indexers conveyors pick and place units glove ports and manipulators as well as endofarm robotic grippers slides and end effectors these products serve a very broad market including food processing packaging paper processing medical electronic automotive nuclear and general industrial products these products are produced in the north america europe and asia and are marketed globally on a direct basis to original equipment manufacturers “oem”s and through a global dealer and distribution network to industrial end users we also provide highly engineered hydraulic cylinders and swivels to the north american markets for use in mining and resource recovery vehicle recovery materials handling and various other oem applications 

 

  

  

printing  identification 

 

our printing  identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking  coding dispensing printing soldering coating inspection and testing equipment and related consumables and services the segment serves three broad global endmarkets fast moving consumer goods industrial and electronics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

printing  identification’s products are manufactured primarily in the united states france china malaysia and germany and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors 

 

raw materials 

  

we use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the required raw materials are generally available commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum select other commodities and rare earth metals although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations we attempt to control such costs through fixedprice contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global supply chain activities 

 

research and development 

 

our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2011 we spent 1970 million for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2010 and 2009 research and development spending totaled 1867 million and 1721 million respectively 

 

our communication technologies and printing  identification segments expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment and specialty electronic components for the consumer goods handset life sciences datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

 

our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the communication technologies and printing  identification segments 

 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

 

our businesses own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships while our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis we believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve 

 

  

  

  

seasonality 

 

in general our businesses while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly those serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste and recycling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets our businesses serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends which tends to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns 

  

customers 

  

we serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in 2011 similarly within each of our four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of any individual segment’s revenue in 2011 

  

given our diversity of served markets customer concentrations are quite varied businesses supplying the waste and recycling agricultural defense energy automotive commercial refrigeration handset and hearing aid industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of enduse applications 

  

certain of our businesses particularly within the communication technologies segment serve the military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure markets their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers within the communication technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers many of the largest global ems companies particularly in china and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers 

  

backlog 

 

backlog is generally not a significant indicator of longterm performance as most of our products have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the aerospace and industrial markets of our communication technologies segment our total backlog as of december 31 2011 and 2010 was 14465 million and 12625 million respectively 

 

competition 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served in general most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality price and innovation however as we become increasingly global we are exposed to more competition certain businesses in the communication technologies and printing  identification segments compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and east asia 

 

international 

 

consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth we continue to increase our expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia and eastern europe 

 

most of our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and with increasing emphasis china malaysia india mexico brazil and eastern europe 

 

the following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the us as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years by segment and in total 

 

 

 

  

  

  

our international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions which are discussed further in “item 1a risk factors” 

  

for additional details regarding our nonus revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws we are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

  

in 2010 we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 we evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20 from 2010 to 2020 we also participated in the 2011 carbon disclosure project as a respondent 

  

all of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers in some instances our businesses may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers including but not limited to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses 

    

there have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment we are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses we anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short to mediumterm we expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass through” costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations 

  

employees 

  

we had approximately 34000 employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2011 which was an increase of 14 from the prior year end the increase reflects the impact of recent acquisitions as well as additional headcount necessary to support the volume growth in 2011 

  

other information 

  

we make available through the “financial reports” link on our internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on our internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k 

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results in general we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global energy markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed 

 

  

  

 

 

 

in 2012 our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate these circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce such negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

 

 

 

our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve in general most of our businesses compete with only a few companies our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences and pricing pressures if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if our businesses do not compete effectively we may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

 

 

certain of our businesses sell their products in electronic and technologybased industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive in these industries they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands also a portion of the communication technologies and printing  identification segments’ revenue is derived from markets that are subject to unpredictable shortterm business cycles 

 

our energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of energy prices and regulations which impact production although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands 

 

as a result of all the above factors the revenue and operating performance of these businesses in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods and these factors could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

 

 

we purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

  

 

 

 

approximately 49 of our revenues for 2011 and 48 of our revenues for 2010 were derived outside the united states we continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from and into foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in addition many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states our foreign operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to international operations including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position 

 

 

 

we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations which are presented in us dollars a significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lowercost locations and sold in various countries crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling swiss franc chinese rmb yuan and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries such as china our sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

 

 

we are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations if we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

 

 

 

our growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions if we are unsuccessful in these efforts our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

 

 

our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws including environmental and export laws regulations and policies failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates in addition we have invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation 

 

our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

 

 

 

our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” requirement for disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined in the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries some of our businesses customers already have announced that they will require “conflict free” metals in products they purchase 

 

we have begun the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses as required by the doddfrank act the supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors we have begun to obtain and review the information from our suppliers we may not be able to complete the process in the timeframe required because of the complexity of our supply chain 

 

other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers manufacturing operations and operating profits 

 

the need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts lead to supply shortages or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods  

 

 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

 

  

  

 

 

 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot be assured that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position   

 

 

 

our businesses own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

 

 

we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated or may expose us to unexpected liabilities further if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows 

 

 

 

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our longterm debt as of december 31 2011 although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings if our current credit ratings deteriorate then our borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under our fiveyear credit facility and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

 

 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud antikickback and false claims rules competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits and could damage our reputation  

 

  

 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

 

not applicable 

 




 item 2 properties   

 

the number type location and size of our properties as of december 31 2011 are shown in the following charts by segment 

 

 

 

during 2011 we increased the number of our manufacturing and warehouse facilities generally reflecting the facilities of the nine businesses acquired during the year we believe our facilities are wellmaintained and suitable for our operations 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

a few of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and it is anticipated to be immaterial to us on a consolidated basis in addition a few of our subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to our businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of the use of our businesses products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves in the opinion of management based on these reviews it is unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

special note regarding forwardlooking statements 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended december 31 2011 the mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes which appear elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in item 1a “risk factors” and in “special note regarding forward looking statements” inside the front cover of this form 10k 

 

overview and outlook 

dover delivered a record year in 2011 in terms of revenue earnings and bookings our consolidated revenue increased 13 billion or 20 to 80 billion inclusive of acquisitions while our bookings grew by 12 billion or 17 to 81 billion and our gross profit grew by 435 million or 17 to 31 billion however our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points to 384 mainly due to product and customer mix as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which more than offset operating leverage earnings from continuing operations increased 23 to 846 million 

in addition to our strong financial results we accomplished several important strategic initiatives in 2011 we realigned our businesses into four new segments to more closely match our key endmarkets this new structure will serve to support our growth strategies and productivity initiatives as we continue to build our company during 2011 we deployed 14 billion on nine acquisitions that added technology opened new markets and expanded geography in nearly all of our growth spaces we also divested three businesses consistent with our strategy of focusing on our higher margin growth spaces we received proceeds in excess of 500 million which we intend to utilize on future acquisitions or internal investments lastly we generated 786 million in free cash flow which enabled us to aggressively invest in higher growth economies and innovation and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend now standing at 56 consecutive years 

  

as we concluded the fourth quarter we encountered certain challenges such as continued weakness in alternative energy semiconductor and telecom infrastructure markets and general softness within the european economy including uncertainty around european credit markets that may continue to impact our operations going into 2012 

despite these challenges given our strong financial position and the depth and resilience of our business mix we believe that through continued execution of our strategies around positioning ourselves to capitalize on global growth trends capturing the benefits of common ownership and disciplined capital allocation we are well positioned for solid growth in 2012 

we expect 2012 full year organic growth to be in the range of 4 to 7 and acquisition related growth to be approximately 3 for acquisitions completed in 2011 based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations we expect our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2012 will be in the range of 470 to 500 and expect our earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters 

  

  

consolidated results of operations 

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we are reporting three businesses that were sold during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 as discontinued operations therefore we have classified the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented

our 2011 consolidated revenue increased 13 billion or 20 compared with 2010 reflecting organic growth of 11 growth from acquisitions of 7 and a favorable impact from currency translation of 2 the majority of our organic growth was attributed to increased volumes across all four segments driven by strength in the energy and consumer handset markets and solid growth in fluid solutions refrigeration equipment and many of the industrial markets served by our engineered systems segment additionally approximately 2 of our growth was generated by new products particularly in our communication technologies and printing  identification segments pricing added about 1 to revenue principally driven by strategic pricing initiatives and price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs revenues generated outside of the us increased by 22 compared with 2010 with revenue generated in emerging economies of china and latin america increasing 47 

over 70 of the revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by harbisonfischer and sound solutions two large acquisitions that we made in 2011 to expand our operations serving the artificial lift and handset markets respectively 

our 2010 consolidated revenue increased 13 billion or 24 compared with 2009 reflecting organic revenue growth of 20 growth from acquisitions of 4 and a negligible unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation the organic growth reflected volume increases across all four of our segments driven by higher demand in the majority of our endmarkets as the global economy continued to rebound in 2010 from the 2009 down cycle revenues generated outside of the us increased by 30 compared with 2009 with much of this growth generated in emerging economies of asia and latin america 

gross profit 

our gross profit increased 4348 million or 17 in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes however gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 100 basis points in 2011 to 384 from 394 in 2010 due principally to the impact of product and customer mix which more than offset operating leverage as well as the impact of higher depreciation from recent acquisitions 

gross profit increased 6035 million or 30 in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was 394 in 2010 a 170 basis point improvement over the 2009 gross profit margin of 377 reflecting the increase in sales volumes in 2010 the impact of lower restructuring charges on a comparative basis and benefits realized from restructuring initiatives executed in 2009 along with our productivity initiatives 

 

 

  

  

  

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 2333 million or 15 in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses declined to 232 in 2011 compared with 242 in 2010 this 100 basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels which more than offset higher amortization and other nonrecurring expenses related to recent acquisitions 

selling and administrative expenses increased 1853 million or 13 in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of revenue selling and administrative expenses declined to 242 in 2010 compared with 266 in 2009 this 240 basis point improvement reflects the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefits realized from 2009 restructuring efforts as well as leverage from the higher revenue levels partially offset by increased compensation costs 

 

nonoperating items 

interest expense net increased 9 to 1156 million in 2011 due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings during 2011 as compared with 2010 as discussed in note 8   to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k in february of 2011 we issued 800 million in new notes receiving net proceeds of 789 million approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire 400 million of notes which came due earlier that month with the remainder used to fund first quarter acquisitions as a result our total borrowings were 380 million higher at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010 in 2010 interest expense net increased 60 to 1064 million primarily due to reduced interest income in 2010 resulting from lower interest rates on the company’s short term investment balances 

other nonoperating expense income net of 01 million in 2011 includes 86 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency offset by royalty income and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains none of which are individually significant other nonoperating expense net of 37 million in 2010 reflects 69 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency coupled with a 43 million loss on extinguishment of debt offset in part by royalty income and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains this compares to other nonoperating income net of 38 million in 2009 which reflects 61 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency which was more than offset by a favorable insurance settlement and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains 

income taxes 

the 2011 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 227 compared to the 2010 rate of 232 the effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete and other items in both years primarily driven by favorable audit settlements for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions relating to prior periods the effective rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by net discrete items totaling 413 million principally arising from settlements with the us federal taxing authority and state taxing authorities the effective tax rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling 503 million arising principally from settlements with the us federal taxing authority coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter the effective tax rate of 245 in 2009 was favorably impacted by 316 million of net benefits recognized for discrete items excluding these discrete and other items a nongaap measure the effective tax rate was 265 in 2011 288 in 2010 and 309 in 2009 reflecting the geographic mix of earnings with the earnings generated in foreign markets typically taxed at lower rates than in the us while we believe additional uncertain tax positions will be settled within the next twelve months an estimate cannot be made due to the uncertainties associated with the resolution of these matters 

  

  

  

net earnings 

net earnings from continuing operations was 8464 million in 2011 an increase of 23 compared to 2010 due mainly to the earnings on increased revenue and a lower effective tax rate net earnings from continuing operations were 6908 million in 2010 an increase of 85 compared to 2009 mainly due to increased revenues operating margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate 

net earnings from discontinued operations increased to 489 million in 2011 primarily reflecting income of 536 million from the operations of the three businesses sold this year and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities offset in part by a net loss on the sale of these businesses of 47 million inclusive of goodwill impairment in 2010 our net earnings from discontinued operations of 94 million includes income of 236 million from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities offset in part by a net loss of approximately 142 million related to the sale of a business that had been reflected as a discontinued operation in a previous year the 2009 net loss from discontinued operations of 170 million includes a net loss on sale of 112 million mainly related to a writedown of a business held for sale coupled with other net losses from operations totaling 58 million refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations 

diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 increased 23 to 448 and diluted net earnings per share increased 28 to 474 as a result of the same factors discussed above 

diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 increased 83 to 365 and diluted net earnings per share increased 94 to 370 as a result of the same factors discussed above 

  

restructuring activity 

we periodically undertake restructuring programs in response to prevailing business requirements and market conditions in addition to these factors 2009 earnings across all segments were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges while 2011 and 2010 earnings reflect the benefits captured from the businesses’ restructuring and integration programs initiated in 2008 and 2009 

in late 2008 we launched various synergy capture programs and restructuring initiatives in response to the weakening global economic environment at the time in 2008 and 2009 we recorded restructuring charges of 239 million and 673 million respectively relating to these programs these programs were largely executed throughout 2009 and we realized incremental savings of approximately 125 million and 32 million in 2009 and 2010 respectively during 2009 we had a net reduction in our workforce of approximately 2950 or 9 and a net reduction of 23 manufacturing and warehouse facilities as a result of these strategic restructuring efforts by 2010 we had completed the majority of the initiatives launched in 2008 and 2009 

in 2010 and 2011 our businesses were generally expanding their operations so our restructuring activities were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations we incurred restructuring charges of 62 million and 57 million respectively relating to such activities 

we do not currently anticipate significant restructuring activity in 2012 but will continue to monitor business activity across our end markets and adjust capacity as necessary depending on the economic climate and other internal business factors 

  

  

segment results of operations 

 

as discussed previously in the fourth quarter of 2011 we reorganized our businesses into four new segments to better align with our key endmarkets as such the information herein has been recast to conform to the new segment structure for all periods presented see note 1 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a reconciliation of segment revenue earnings and operating margin to our consolidated revenue earnings from continuing operations and operating margin 

 

communication technologies 

 

2011 versus 2010 

 

revenue generated by our communication technologies segment increased 2841 million or 26 compared with 2010 with 1902 million or 18 of the growth attributed principally to the 2011 acquisition of sound solutions which supplements our product offerings in the growing handset market although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to normal pricing concessions for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains new product introductions and product mix 

our organic revenue growth of 7 was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the communications market which grew significantly year over year our revenue in the communications market representing 31 of 2011 segment revenue increased 666 million or 42 excluding sound solutions our microelectronic mechanical “mems” microphones and sisonic™ technologies were well positioned to capitalize on this markets growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands we also experienced solid demand in the commercial aerospace market due to increased build rates of commercial aircraft by leading aircraft manufactures and increased demand for our aftermarket products globally our aerospaceindustrial revenue 18 of 2011 segment revenue increased 590 million or 32 this overall growth was partially offset by weakened demand in the global telecom markets driven in part by deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation this contributed to a decrease of 72 million or 3 in our telecommunicationother revenue 17 of 2011 segment revenue revenue derived from our defense market 16 of 2011 segment revenue declined 82 million or 4 mainly due to timing and funding of certain programs our life sciences revenue 18 of segment revenue also declined by 164 million or 6 principally due to softer hearing aid demand in the first half of 2011 and overall softer medical equipment demand 

communication technologies 2011 earnings increased 10 compared with 2010 but operating margin declined 250 basis points the margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization higher raw material costs and lower margins from the integration of the sound solutions acquisition excluding the impact of sound solutions earnings would have increased by 366 million or 18 and operating margin would have increased by 160 basis points as compared with 2010 

bookings and backlog at the end of 2011 indicate continued strength in the handset and aerospace markets as we head into 2012 offset by continued softness in the telecommunication market 

  

2010 versus 2009 

  

communication technologies 2010 revenue and earnings increased 18 and 44 respectively compared with 2009 the increase in revenues was supported by organic revenue growth of 17 and growth from acquisitions of 1 offset by a negligible impact from foreign currency translation the organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong demand for mems microphones hearing aid components and telecom infrastructure related products earnings and operating margin in 2010 were favorably impacted by higher sales volume and production leverage coupled with the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefit of 2009 restructuring programs 

  

  

  

  

energy 

 

2011 versus 2010 

  

our energy segment posted record organic revenue earnings and bookings in 2011 revenue and earnings were up 46 and 43 respectively due to continued strength in the drilling production and downstream energy markets served by the segment recent acquisitions generated revenue growth of 19 and contributed to the segment’s record results sales outside of north america grew 35 driven by significantly higher sales to central and south america the middle east and russia pricing actions generally undertaken to offset commodity inflation accounted for a marginal portion of the revenue increase production sector revenue representing 51 of 2011 segment revenue increased 72 with 35 due to organic growth and 37 from acquisitions the organic growth was driven by higher drilling and well completion activity increased international sales and higher demand for winch products serving the energy infrastructure and recovery markets drilling sector revenue 21 of 2011 segment revenue grew 34 due to increased exploration activity pricing and market share increases our revenues in the drilling and production sectors are impacted by changes in the number of active north american drilling rigs the average north american drilling rig count in 2011 was up 21 over the prior year driven by strong oil prices downstream sector revenue 28 of 2011 segment revenue was up 20 with 14 from organic revenue growth and the balance from recent acquisitions the organic growth reflects continued strong demand for products in the power generation rail cargo tank and chemicalindustrial markets as well as nozzles and hanging hardware for retail fueling stations 

energy earnings increased 1345 million or 43 from the higher organic and acquisition volumes energy operating margin declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year due to the impact of acquisitionrelated costs including higher depreciation and amortization and higher material costs partially offset by improved operating leverage associated with the higher volumes strategic pricing and productivity gains 

both bookings and backlog at the end of december increased significantly compared to the prior year and we expect market conditions in 2012 to continue to be favorable for the energy segment the market compression of natural gas prices should not have a significant impact to our operations as we expect the effects of the migration away from dry gas to be offset by increased oil and liquid rich gas activity 

  

2010 versus 2009 

 

our energy segment’s 2010 revenue and earnings increased 31 and 49 respectively compared with 2009 organic revenue growth of 25 was driven by a significant increase in active north american drilling rigs and market share gains in our drilling sector businesses increased drilling activity also favorably impacted our businesses in the production sector particularly demand for sucker rods the average north american drilling rig count in 2010 was up 45 compared to 2009 the 2009 inproseal acquisition contributed revenue growth of approximately 5 and foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenue by 1 the increase in earnings is the result of higher sales volume and benefits from productivity improvements and 2009 restructuring initiatives 

  

  

  

engineered systems 

 

  

2011 versus 2010 

engineered systems 2011 revenue increased 11 driven by organic revenue growth of 9 favorable foreign currency of 1 and a negligible impact from recent acquisitions revenue of our refrigeration  industrial platform which serves our refrigeration and food equipment waste and recycling and other industrial endmarkets increased 205 million or 9 revenue from refrigeration and food equipment representing 35 of 2011 segment revenue increased 91 million or 9 reflecting strong demand for refrigeration systems fueled by remodel activity at major retail chains performance by our businesses serving the waste and recycling and other industrial markets 43 of 2011 segment revenue was driven by increased global demand for industrial automation machinery improving demand for vehicle services in the important asian markets and a market rebound in hydraulic equipment due in part to strength in the mining sector partially offset by a doubledigit decline in waste and recycling revenue given continued constraints on municipal spending these factors combined to increase other industrial revenue by 114 million or 9 

  

revenue of our fluid solutions platform 22 of 2011 segment revenue increased by 110 million or 19 reflecting strong demand for pumps in the chemical transport and hygienic markets and increasing demand for heat exchange systems coupled with the benefits from geographic expansion particularly in asia and price increases necessary to cover rising commodity costs 

  

engineered systems segment earnings increased 625 million or 16 on the strength of increased volume operating margin expanded by 70 basis points as a result of positive pricing actions and productivity savings which more than offset cost escalation and unfavorable product mix 

  

bookings and backlog at the end of 2011 have increased compared to 2010 levels driven by higher refrigeration pump and heat exchange orders we continue to invest in market leading technologies to better serve the refrigeration market as we expect more economies to propose and pass carbonlimiting legislation in the coming years an example of this is our fourth quarter acquisition of advansor as which manufactures energy efficient transcritical co 2 systems used in refrigeration systems 

2010 versus 2009 

our engineered systems’ 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 21 and 37 respectively as compared with 2009 organic revenue growth of 16 was driven by higher sales volumes in refrigeration systems and vehicle service offerings offset in part by softness in waste and recycling markets earnings and margin were favorably impacted by increased volumes in high margin businesses the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits associated with 2009 restructuring initiatives 

  

  

printing  identification 

 

 

  

2011 versus 2010 

our printing  identification segment’s 2011 revenue increased 8 compared with 2010 with 5 of the increase attributed to higher organic and new product volumes and 3 from favorable foreign currency impacts price was slightly favorable offsetting commodity inflation electronics revenue representing 42 of 2011 segment revenue was up 11 versus the prior year with strong first half growth of 50 driven by strong demand in the alternative energy and semiconductor markets partially offset by a revenue decline in the second half of 17 as demand weakened in these same electronic markets additionally we realized volume growth in our fast moving consumer goods fmcg 35 of 2011 segment revenue and industrial products 23 of 2011 segment revenue with combined 6 revenue growth year over year driven by successful new product introductions that gained traction as the year progressed 

  

printing  identification earnings declined 11 million in 2011 resulting in an operating margin decline of 190 basis points the margin decline is primarily attributed to the second half reduction in alternative energy and semiconductor revenues which are typically higher margin activity coupled with unfavorable regional mix due to weaker european markets for our fmcg and key strategic investments for growth directed toward our fmcg industrial and electronics end markets we expect these investments to continue into 2012 as we consider these end markets integral to our longerterm revenue growth focus we also completed several small employee reduction in force programs across targeted businesses to streamline operations and to align more closely with our growth in geographic end markets costs related to these programs were not significant 

  

yearend 2011 bookings and backlog levels are down from the prior year primarily due to the slowdown in electronics end markets particularly alternative energy and semiconductor we currently expect these market conditions to continue through the first half of 2012 

2010 versus 2009 

our printing  identification segment’s 2010 revenue increased by 30 compared with 2009 substantially driven by increased demand in all of its major product categories including marking and coding and electronic assembly and board test equipment demand was fueled by the economic recovery increased semiconductor handling business and growth in solaralternative energy products earnings in 2010 increased over 200 compared with 2009 primarily due to the favorable impact of product and geographic mix the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits of 2009 restructuring initiatives 

  

  

  

financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing our capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

 

cash flow summary 

the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased 1564 million primarily due to increased net earnings in 2011 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2010 higher sales volume increased 2011 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by 256 million as compared with 2010 our investment in working capital was 151 million lower than in 2010 at which time a working capital buildup was necessary to support revenue levels recovering from the 2009 declines these increases in cash flow were partially offset by 178 million of higher income tax payments resulting from our higher earnings and 2011 tax settlement activity as well as higher employee incentive compensation payments and reductions in deferred revenue 

cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased 1585 million from 2009 higher sales volume increased 2010 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by 354 million as compared with 2009 this was offset by a 220 million increase in working capital necessary to support the increase in 2010 order and revenue levels compared to a 179 million decrease in working capital in the 2009 period when sales levels had declined other factors contributing to the 2010 increase in operating cash flows included 49 million less in restructuring payments 21 million less of postretirement plan contributions and a 54 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional sales activity in the 2010 period 

postretirement costs relating to pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans affect results in all segments we recorded net periodic benefit cost of 40 million 33 million and 37 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit supplemental and postretirement plans the main drivers of expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our longterm estimates including expected returns on plan assets the service cost and the interest cost in 2011 the actual return on us plan assets increased while returns on our nonus plan assets declined as a result of the different mix of investments in the plans in 2010 the actual return on plan assets increased consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets in 2012 we expect our net periodic benefit cost to be approximately 48 million with the increase compared to 2011 being attributed to higher amortization relating to unrecognized losses 

the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements at december 31 2011 the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit plans reflected underfunding by 75 million which includes 12 million relating to the us dover corporate pension plan and 63 million relating to our significant international pension plans some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to prefund the plans due to local regulations the majority of the international obligations relate to defined pension plans operated by our businesses in germany the united kingdom and switzerland cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2011 2010 and 2009 totaled 49 million 38 million and 51 million respectively in 2012 we expect to contribute 20 to 40 million to our qualified defined benefit plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion regarding our postretirement plans 

 

adjusted working capital 

in 2011 adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased from 2010 by 207 million or 17 to 14 billion which reflected an increase in receivables of 167 million an increase in net inventory of 145 million and an increase in accounts payable of 105 million generally due to additional working capital investment necessary to support the increased revenue levels and the impact of 2011 acquisitions excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of 16 million adjusted working capital would have increased by 63 million or 5 

  

  

  

investing activities 

we used cash for investing activities of 10 billion in 2011 and 1715 million in 2010 mainly for capital spending and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from the sale of businesses in 2011 our use of cash for investing activities also included a net payment of 18 million on the settlement of foreign exchange forward contracts which had served as hedges of a portion of our eurodenominated net investment 

acquisitions  in 2011 we used cash of 14 billion to acquire nine businesses including 401 million for harbisonfischer in the first quarter and 824 million for sound solutions in the third quarter in comparison we used 104 million to acquire six businesses in 2010 

capital spending  capital expenditures primarily to support capacity expansion innovation and cost savings were 271 million in 2011 and 175 million in 2010 the increase in 2011 capital spending reflects investment in capacity expansion within our businesses principally serving the highgrowth energy drilling and handset markets in 2011 our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue were approximately 34 we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in 2012 to increase slightly driven by capacity expansion to support our highgrowth highdemand energy and handset markets  

proceeds from sales of businesses we generated cash of 517 million in 2011 primarily from the sale of paladin brands crenlo and heil trailer international three businesses that had operated in our engineered systems segment this compares to net proceeds of 45 million generated by the sale of triton in 2010 

shortterm investments we typically invest cash in excess of nearterm requirements in shortterm investments in 2011 we generated net proceeds of 124 million from the sale of shortterm investments which were used to fund a portion of the sound solutions acquisition in 2010 our shortterm investment activity generated net proceeds of 87 million 

we anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make in 2012 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper or through public debt markets 

financing activities 

we used cash for financing activities of 505 million in 2011 and 3048 million in 2010 mainly for purchase of our common stock and payment of dividends largely offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options 

longterm and shortterm debt  in 2011 we realized net proceeds of 789 million from the 43 10year notes due 2021 and 5375 30year notes due 2041 issued in february approximately half of which was used to repay 400 million of other borrowings principally commercial paper used to repay the 650 10year notes which came due earlier in february 2011 and to fund acquisitions made in the first quarter 

treasury purchases  we historically repurchase shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements and expect to continue with this policy we used 242 million for share repurchases in 2011 compared with 124 million in 2010 during 2011 we repurchased approximately 40 million shares of our common stock in the open market pursuant to the 10000000 share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in may 2007 in 2010 we purchased approximately 23 million shares under the same program approximately 25 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this 10000000 five year authorization as of december 31 2011 

dividend payments  total dividend payments to common shareholders were 219 million in 2011 and 200 million in 2010 our dividends per common share increased 10 to 118 per share in 2011 compared to 107 per share in 2010 this represents the 56 th consecutive year that our dividend has increased 

proceeds from exercise of stock options  we received 40 million from employee exercises of stock options in 2011 compared to 80 million in 2010 since 2006 we have issued only stocksettled appreciation rights “sars” and a greater portion of our 2011 exercise activity was related to sars which do not require cash settlement 

  

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure free cash flow a nongaap measure we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt pay dividends fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock for further information see the nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities 

 

for 2011 we generated free cash flow of 7864 million representing 99 of revenue and 929 of earnings from continuing operations while continuing to make investments necessary to support our growth free cash flow in 2010 was 7270 million or 109 of revenue compared to 6304 million or 118 of revenue in 2009 the full year increase in 2011 free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower investment in working capital partially offset by higher tax payments in 2011 in 2011 we made tax payments of approximately 281 million compared to 103 million in the prior year with the 2011 increase resulting from the higher level of earnings the timing of estimated payments and the impact of certain changes in federal tax regulations free cash flow is also impacted by higher capital expenditures in 2011 necessary to fund expansion in our highgrowth businesses we expect to generate free cash flow in 2012 of approximately 10 of revenue consistent with our historical performance 

the 2010 increase in free cash flow compared to 2009 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations offset by investment in working capital and an increase in capital expenditures the 90 basis point decline in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was the result of the significant reduction in working capital realized in 2009 coupled with lower revenue levels 

  net debt to net capitalization 

we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

 

our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december 31 2011 primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling 14 billion during the year total borrowings increased by 380 million during 2011 primarily due to 789 million net proceeds received from the 43 10year notes due 2021 and 5375 30year notes due 2041 issued in february approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire 400 million of notes which came due earlier in february 2011 in 2011 we also received cash proceeds of 517 million primarily from the sale of three businesses 

  

  

  

at december 31 2011 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 12 billion representing a decrease of 104 million as compared with the 2010 balance including shortterm investments cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less we regularly invest cash in excess of nearterm requirements in shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months up to twelve months we held no shortterm investments at december 31 2011 at december 31 2011 our total cash and cash equivalents included 600 million held outside of the united states 

 

we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock in november of 2011 we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks to replace our existing facility that was set to expire in november 2012 our new facility permits borrowings up to 1 billion which is consistent with the facility we replaced and expires on november 10 2016 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for our commercial paper program we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so if we were to draw down a loan at our election the loan would bear interest at a eurodollar or sterling rate based on libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 0565 to 1225 subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by sp and moody’s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility under this facility we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 30 to 1 we were in compliance with this covenant and our other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2011 and had a coverage ratio of 143 to 1 we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec with remaining capacity of 1 billion that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions 

at december 31 2011 we have an outstanding floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of 50 million in exchange for chf 651 million in february 2011 we amended and restated the terms of the arrangement to extend its maturity date to october 15 2015 this transaction continues to hedge a portion of our net investment in chfdenominated operations the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings the fair value at december 31 2011 reflected a loss of 217 million due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 

in january 2011 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to purchase 350 million for €2587 million which were designated as hedging an equivalent amount of our euro denominated net investment the agreements qualified as net investment hedges with the changes in fair value being reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings these arrangements were settled on april 4 2011 at which time we realized a loss of 182 million which is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment 

our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of our existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as our current credit standing our credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2011 

 

 

we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase our debt operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 599 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions which expire at various dates in 2012 through 2016 these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance warranty and other performance obligations in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations the probability of which we believe is remote 

we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety tax and employment matters we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

 

  

  

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2011 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts we report these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and our financial condition the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 200913 which amended existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenuegenerating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method we adopted the multiple element guidance of asu 200913 effective january 1 2011 we do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements so the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu 200914 which eliminates tangible products containing both software and nonsoftware components that operate together to deliver a product’s functionality from the scope of thencurrent generally accepted accounting principles for software we adopted asu 200914 on a prospective basis effective january 1 2011 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this asu only requires a change in the format of the current presentation we adopted this guidance for our 2011 yearend reporting presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings 

  

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201109 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension plans the standard is intended to provide more information about an employer’s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates this guidance became effective for our fiscal 2011 yearend reporting its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements this guidance is effective for us beginning on january 1 2012 its adoption is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current twostep test for goodwill impairment if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements the adoption of this asu is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

  

 

nongaap disclosures 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also disclose nongaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors free cash flow net debt total debt net capitalization the net debt to net capitalization ratio adjusted working capital earnings adjusted for nonrecurring items effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities debt or equity earnings revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe the 1 net debt to net capitalization ratio and 2 free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase our common stock reconciliations of free cash flow total debt and net debt can be found above in this item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers we believe that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called “working capital” which is calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue we believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes given the global nature of our businesses we believe that reporting organic or core revenue growth which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods 

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the diverse nature of our businesses’ activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

interest rate exposure 

we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2011 we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts we issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pretax earnings 

we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 260 million however since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

foreign currency exposure 

we conduct business in various nonus countries primarily in canada mexico substantially all of the european countries brazil argentina malaysia china india and other asian countries therefore we have a significant volume of foreign currency exposures that result from our international sales purchases investments borrowings and other international transactions changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 

we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in nonus operations we may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges at december 31 2011 we had one outstanding floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of 50 million in exchange for chf 651 million which matures on october 15 2015 this transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in nonus operations the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings the fair values at december 31 2011 and 2010 reflected losses of 217 million and 198 million respectively due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 

certain individual operating subsidiaries that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of nonus operating companies in which the majority of all costs are localcurrency based a change of 5 or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the translation of our balance sheet or statement of earnings

business strategy 

 

the company operates with certain fundamental business strategies first it seeks to acquire and own businesses that manufacture proprietary engineered products and are leaders in four broad markets industrial products engineered systems fluid management and electronic technologies to ensure success dover companies place strong emphasis on new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets second the company’s businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital third the company is committed to an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness fourth the company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a balanced manner to grow its businesses and to increase shareholder value 

 

management philosophy 

 

the company’s operating structure of four defined industry segments and six core business platforms within those segments drives focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of the company’s executive talent the presidents of the company’s operating companies and groups have responsibility for their businesses’ performance as they are able to serve customers by focusing closely on their products and markets and reacting quickly to customer needs the company’s segment and executive management set strategic direction and initiatives provide oversight allocate and manage capital are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services

company goals 

 

the company is committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives first the company is committed to achieving annual organic sales growth over the next three years 2011 through 2013 of 6 to 8 complemented by acquisition growth of 3 to 5 over the same periods secondly the company continues to focus on margin improvement activities and to expand return on invested capital to effectuate earnings per share growth ranging from 10 to 13 on an annual basis lastly the company is committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales in excess of 10 through disciplined capital allocation productivity improvements and active working capital management the company supports these goals through 1 alignment of management compensation with these objectives 2 well defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 talent development programs 

 

portfolio development 

 

acquisitions 

 

the company’s acquisition program has two elements first it seeks to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden its existing companies and their global reach manufacture innovative components and equipment specialty systems andor support services and sell to industrial or commercial users second in the right circumstances it will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement its existing companies or allow the company to pursue a new platform during the last three years 2008 — 2010 the company purchased 16 businesses with an aggregate cost of 4366 million 

 

in 2010 the company acquired six addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 1044 million in 2009 the company also acquired six addon businesses for aggregate consideration of 2284 million including 64 million of consideration paid in the form of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of inproseal company in 2008 the company acquired four addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 1038 million 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company’s future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of the company’s current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while the company expects to generate annual organic growth of 4 — 5 over a business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year 

 

dispositions 

 

while the company generally expects to hold and integrate businesses that it buys it continually reviews its portfolio to verify that those businesses continue to be essential contributors to the company’s longterm growth strategy occasionally the company may also make an opportunistic sale of one of its companies based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations during the past three years 2008 2010 the company decided to reduce its exposure to small lower margin operations and accordingly it discontinued one operation and sold seven businesses for aggregate consideration of approximately 1008 million for more details see the “discontinued operations” discussion below and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

the company’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the needed raw materials are generally available commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities the company has generally kept pace with or exceeded raw material cost increases using effective pricing strategies during 2010 the company experienced modest increases in commodity prices 

 

research and development 

 

the company’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2010 the company spent 1935 million for research and development including qualified engineering costs in 2009 and 2008 research and development spending totaled 1783 million and 1892 million respectively 

our operating companies in the product identification platform and electronic technologies segment expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high the companies that develop product identification equipment and specialty electronic components for the life sciences datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

 

the company’s other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the product identification platform and the electronic technologies segment 

 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

 

the company owns many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of the company’s intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that its companies seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of the company’s intangible assets relate to customer relationships while the company’s intellectual property and customer relationships are important to its success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect the company on a consolidated basis the company believes that its companies’ commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to their general leadership positions in the niche markets that they serve 

 

seasonality 

 

in general dover companies while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly companies serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets companies serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends 

 

customers 

 

dover’s companies serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated revenue in 2010 similarly within each of the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segment’s revenue in 2010 

 

with respect to the engineered systems fluid management and industrial products segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies supplying the waste handling construction agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products as well as services applicable to a broad range of end use applications 

 

certain companies within the electronic technologies segment serve the military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure markets their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers of these companies within the electronic technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers many of the largest global ems companies particularly in china and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers 

backlog 

 

backlog generally is not a significant longterm success factor in most of the company’s businesses as most of the products of dover companies have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to those businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the mobile equipment platform within the industrial products segment total company backlog as of december 31 2010 and 2009 was 14095 million and 10835 million respectively 

 

competition 

 

the company’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation dover companies usually have more significant competitors domestically where their principal markets are than in nonus markets however dover companies are becoming increasingly global where more competitors exist 

 

certain companies in the electronic technologies and engineered systems segments compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and east asia 

 

international 

 

for nonus revenue and an allocation of the assets of the company’s continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

most of the company’s nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in france germany the united kingdom the netherlands sweden switzerland and with increasing emphasis china malaysia india mexico brazil and eastern europe 

 

although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions the company continues to increase its expansion into international markets particularly in developing economies in south america asia and eastern europe 

 

environmental matters 

 

the company’s operations are governed by a variety of international national state and local environmental laws dover is committed to continued compliance and believes its companies’ operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance 

 

in 2010 the company developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from its many independently operated companies in addition the company has evaluated its climate change risks and opportunities and is in the process of developing a strategy to manage these risks and opportunities the company plans to have this strategy completed in 2011 including clearly defined goals and objectives along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions 

 

all of the company’s segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to the operation and use of their products and services by customers in some instances dover’s operating companies may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs increased demand for energyefficient products based on a variety of drivers including but not limited to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased sales for a number of dover’s operating companies 

 

there have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the company resulting from compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment the company is aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where its manufacturing and warehousedistribution facilities are located and has evaluated the potential impact of 

these regulations on the its businesses the company anticipates that direct impacts from regulatory actions will be insignificant in the short to mediumterm the company expects the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass through” costs from energy suppliers suppliers of raw materials and other services related to its operations 

 

employees 

 

the company had approximately 32000 employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2010 which was an increase of approximately 9 from the prior year end the increase reflects additional headcount necessary to support the volume growth in 2010 as well as the impact of recent acquisitions

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause its actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results in general the company is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global energy markets possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10k and should not be considered the only risks facing the company 

 

the company has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it considers material 

 

  

in 2011 the company’s businesses may continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which the company operates these circumstances will also impact the company’s suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on the company’s business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce such negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond the company’s control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on the company’s revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

 

  

the company’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies compete with only a few companies the ability of dover’s companies to compete effectively depends on how successfully they anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by their competitors changes in customer preferences and pricing pressures if dover’s companies are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if dover’s companies do not compete effectively dover companies may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

  

certain dover companies particularly in the electronic technologies segment sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive the companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands also a portion of the electronic technologies segment’s revenue is derived from companies that are subject to unpredictable shortterm business cycles 

 

the energy platform in the fluid management segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of energy prices although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands in addition certain dover businesses manufacture products that are used in or related to residential and commercial construction which can be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new housing starts and other construction markets 

 

as a result of all the above factors the revenue and operating performance of these companies in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods and these factors could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

  

dover’s companies purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in their manufacturing operations which exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain dover companies while the company’s businesses generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or they may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect the ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

approximately 46 of the company’s revenues for 2010 and 43 of the company’s revenues for 2009 were derived outside the united states the company continues to focus on penetrating global markets as part of its overall growth strategy and expects sales from and into foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its revenues in addition many of the company’s manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company’s foreign operations and its global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to international operations including 

 

 12 

 

  

if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational risks of its existing international operations the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or the results of operations and financial position 

 

  

the company conducts business through its subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations which are presented in us dollars a significant and growing portion of the company’s products are manufactured in lowercost locations and sold in various countries crossborder transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro pound sterling chinese rmb yuan and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in the reported results of the company’s operations that could negatively affect its results of operations additionally the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and us dollar potentially exposes the company to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries such as china the company’s sales are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes the weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 

 

  

the company is continually evaluating its cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across its operations if the company is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its various programs it could adversely affect the company’s operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

the company’s growth profitability and effectiveness in conducting its operations and executing its strategic plans depend in part on its ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions if the company is unsuccessful in these efforts its operating results could be adversely affected 

 

  

the company’s domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws including environmental and export laws regulations and policies failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to the company’s reputation in addition the company cannot provide assurance that its costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws including environmental protection employment and health and safety laws will not exceed its estimates in addition the company has 

invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect the company’s businesses and reputation 

 

the company’s effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated then the company’s financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

 

  

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses divert management’s attention and the company may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect its financial condition in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that the company may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect it against potential loss exposures 

 

  

dover companies own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products dover companies employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of dover’s companies and have a negative impact on their revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

the company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden its existing companies and their global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursue large businesses that have the potential to either complement its existing companies or allow the company to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that the company will able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition if the company is unsuccessful in its acquisition efforts then its ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated or may expose the company to unexpected liabilities further if the company fails to allocate its capital appropriately in respect of either its acquisition program or organic growth in its operations the company could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on the company’s operating profits and cash flows 

 

the inability of the company to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within expected time frames could also have an adverse affect on the company’s results of operations 

 

  

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch ratings evaluate the company’s credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for the company’s longterm debt as of 

december 31 2010 although the company does not anticipate a material change in its credit ratings if the company’s current credit ratings deteriorate then its borrowing costs could increase including increased fees under the fiveyear credit facility and the company’s access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected

during the summer of 2010 the company completed the relocation of its corporate headquarters from new york city and its four segment offices from other locations to downers grove illinois the move has consolidated the corporate and segment management teams into one location in order to improve communication and strategic decision making and facilitate performance efficiencies

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and it is anticipated to be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established 

 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of the use of products of dover companies exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves in the opinion of management based on these reviews it is unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position

overview and outlook 

 

as the global economy strengthened in 2010 the company experienced increased demand across most of its endmarkets as well as higher bookings and backlog in all of its segments in total the company’s consolidated revenue increased 14 billion or 24 over 2009 to 71 billion inclusive of acquisitions furthermore the company successfully leveraged the structural improvements made over the last few years to expand consolidated gross profit margin by 200 basis points to 383 as compared with 2009 the company generated free cash flow of 767 million representing 11 of revenue and 108 of earnings from continuing operations despite significant investments necessary to support the growing businesses the company deployed this cash in support of its growth strategies as well as continuing its 55year record of increasing its annual dividend to shareholders developing economies in asia contributed 17 of 2010 consolidated revenues and the company expects to continue its expansion into asia and other growing markets 

 

given this strong momentum entering 2011 along with the execution of its strategies around product innovation global expansion leveraging its scale and disciplined capital allocation the company believes it is wellpositioned for solid growth in the future 

 

the company estimates 2011 full year organic growth to be in the range of 6 to 8 assuming a negligible impact from foreign currency and acquisition related growth to be approximately 3 for transactions completed in 2010 and four acquisitions completed in january 2011 the largest being harbisonfischer which closed on january 3 2011 based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations the company has projected that its diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2011 will be in the range of 405 to 425 and expects its earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters 

consolidated results of operations 

 

 

 

revenue 

 

consolidated revenue in 2010 increased 14 billion or 24 reflecting organic revenue growth of 20 growth from acquisitions of 4 and a negligible unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation the organic growth reflects volume increases across all of the company’s segments driven by higher demand in the majority of the company’s endmarkets as the global economy continues to rebound revenues generated outside of the us increased by 30 compared with 2009 with much of this growth generated in emerging economies of asia and latin america 

 

the 18 billion or 24 decrease in consolidated revenue in 2009 reflected a 24 decline in organic revenue and a 2 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation partially offset by 2 net growth from acquisitions the decline in organic revenue reflected lower demand and sales volumes across all four business segments stemming from general unfavorable global economic conditions 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit increased 6335 million or 30 in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting the increased sales volumes gross profit margin improved to 383 in 2010 a 200 basis point improvement over the 2009 gross profit margin of 363 reflecting the increase in sales volumes in 2010 the impact of lower restructuring charges on a comparative basis and benefits realized from restructuring initiatives executed in 2009 along with dover productivity initiatives 

 

gross profit decreased 6309 million or 23 in 2009 compared with 2008 consistent with the decline in revenue for the period gross margin as a percentage of sales remained essentially flat at 363 and 361 in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

selling and administrative expenses 

 

selling and administrative expenses increased 1866 million or 12 in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes as a percentage of sales selling and administrative expenses declined to 238 in 2010 compared with 262 in 2009 this 240 basis point improvement reflects the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefits realized from 2009 restructuring efforts as well as leverage from the higher revenue levels partially offset by increased compensation costs 

 

selling and administrative expenses decreased 1896 million or 11 in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue activity cost curtailment efforts and integration programs partially offset by restructuring charges selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 262 in 2009 from 225 in the prior year reflecting reduced revenue levels and restructuring charges of 502 million 

 

interest expense net 

 

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 1155 million 1162 million and 1302 million respectively interest income for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 91 million 158 million 342 million respectively 

 

interest expense net increased 60 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to reduced interest income in 2010 resulting from lower interest rates on the company’s short term investment balances 

 

interest expense net increased 45 in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to reduced interest income stemming from lower interest rates on cash and investments which more than offset the reduction in interest expense due to lower average outstanding commercial paper balances during the 2009 period 

 

other expense income net 

 

other expense net of 35 million in 2010 reflects 66 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency coupled with a 43 million loss on extinguishment of debt offset in part by royalty income and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains this compares to other income net of 40 million in 2009 which reflects 60 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the company’s functional currency which was more than offset by a favorable insurance settlement and other miscellaneous nonoperating gains in 2008 other income net of 127 million reflected net gains from foreign currency exchange fluctuations of 67 million coupled with other miscellaneous nonoperating gains 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2010 was 235 compared to the 2009 rate of 244 the effective tax rate was impacted by discrete items in both years the effective tax rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by net discrete items totaling 385 million arising principally from third and fourth quarter settlements with us taxing authorities coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter in the third quarter the effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by 316 million of net benefits recognized for discrete items in the second and fourth quarters of 2009 excluding these discrete items the effective tax rate for 2010 was 276 compared to 308 for 2009 the variance of which is primarily attributed to a more favorable mix of nonus earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions in 2010 with the exception of contested matters for which an estimate cannot be made due to uncertainties the company believes that additional uncertain tax positions will be settled in 2011 

 

the effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2009 was 244 compared to the 2008 rate of 266 reflecting the previously mentioned discrete items in the second and fourth quarters of 2009 the effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by 263 million of net benefits recognized for discrete items in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 the full year 2009 rate reflects the favorable impact of net benefits for discrete items and the favorable impact of a higher percentage of nonus earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions excluding these discrete items the effective tax rate for 2009 was 308 compared to 293 for 2008 

net earnings 

 

net earnings for the year ended december 31 2010 were 7001 million or 370 dilutive earnings per share “eps” including a loss from discontinued operations of 78 million or 004 eps compared to net earnings of 3564 million or 191 dilutive eps for the same period of 2009 including a loss from discontinued operations of 155 million or 008 eps 

 

the loss from discontinued operations in 2010 includes a loss of approximately 142 million net of tax related to the sale of a business that had been previously reflected as a discontinued operation as well as other expense and accrual adjustments relating to other previously discontinued operations these losses and expenses were offset in part by tax benefits which included approximately 116 million relating to discrete tax items settled or resolved during the third and fourth quarters the loss from discontinued operations in 2009 includes approximately 103 million net of tax related to a writedown of a business held for sale refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations 

 

net earnings for the year ended december 31 2009 were 3564 million or 191 dilutive eps including a loss from discontinued operations of 155 million or 008 eps compared to net earnings of 5908 million or 312 dilutive eps for the same period of 2008 including a loss from discontinued operations of 1039 million or 055 eps as noted above the loss from discontinued operations in 2009 includes approximately 103 million net of tax related to a writedown of a business held for sale the loss from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflects a loss provision for a business held for sale as well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing federal tax settlements and state tax assessments 

 

in addition to these factors 2009 earnings across all platforms were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges as noted below while 2010 earnings reflect the benefits captured from the businesses’ restructuring and integration programs initiated in 2008 and 2009 

 

severance and exit reserves

financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

net debt to net capitalization 

 

the company utilizes the net debt to net capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

 

 

the company’s net debt to net capitalization levels improved during 2010 primarily as a result of cash generated from operations and lower levels of acquisition investments in addition longterm debt decreased due to scheduled repayments coupled with the early extinguishment of a structured noninterest bearing loan in the third quarter 

 

at december 31 2010 the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 13 billion representing an increase of 371 million as compared with the 2009 balance cash and equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less the company regularly invests cash in excess of nearterm requirements in shortterm investments which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months up to twelve months at december 31 2010 the company’s total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments included 12 billion held outside of the united states and the company intends to use a significant portion of this to fund the sound solutions acquisition as described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

free cash flow

the following table reconciles free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities 

 

 

 

free cash flow in 2010 was 7673 million or 108 of revenue compared to 6821 million or 118 of revenue in 2009 and 8346 million or 110 of revenue in 2008 the 2010 increase in free cash flow compared to 2009 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations offset by investment in working capital and an increase in capital expenditures as compared to the prior year the 100 basis point decline in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was the result of the significant reduction in working capital realized in 2009 coupled with lower revenue levels 

 

the 2009 decrease in free cash flow compared to 2008 reflected lower earnings from continuing operations and higher employee benefit contributions partially offset by improvements in working capital and a decrease in capital expenditures the increase in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was due to active management of adjusted working capital in a lower revenue environment 

 

the company uses commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of its common stock the company currently maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to 1 billion which expires on november 9 2012 this facility is used primarily as liquidity backup for the company’s commercial paper program the company has not drawn down any loans under this facility nor does it anticipate doing so if the company were to draw down a loan at the company’s election the loan would bear interest at a eurodollar or sterling rate based on libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 013 to 035 subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded the company’s senior unsecured debt by sp and moody’s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility under this facility the company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 35 to 1 the company was in compliance with this covenant and its other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2010 and had a coverage ratio of 121 to 1 the company is not aware of any potential impairment to its liquidity and expects to remain in compliance with all of its debt covenants 

 

the company also has a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec with remaining capacity of 600 million that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of existing indebtedness capital expenditures and acquisitions

the company’s ability to obtain debt financing at comparable riskbased interest rates is partly a function of its existing cashflowtodebt and debttocapitalization levels as well as its current credit standing the company’s 

credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies were as follows as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase the company’s debt however management anticipates that the net debt to net capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with the historical range of 2530 operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company’s various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

management also assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis

periodic benefit cost to be approximately 36 million with the increase compared to 2010 being attributed to higher amortization relating to unrecognized losses

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the diverse nature of the company’s business activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks including those related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as the company’s policy is to contract with highlyrated diversified counterparties 

 

interest rate exposure 

 

the company may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2010 the company did not have any open interest rate swap contracts the company issues commercial paper which exposes it to changes in variable interest rates however maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on the company’s pretax earnings 

 

the company considers its current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since its debt is largely longterm and fixedrate in nature generally the fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of company’s longterm debt by approximately 130 million however since the company has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturities the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or financial position 

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

the company conducts business in various nonus countries primarily in canada mexico substantially all of the european countries brazil argentina malaysia china india and other asian countries therefore the company has a significant volume of foreign currency exposures that result from its international sales purchases investments borrowings and other international transactions changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the company’s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 

 

the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in nonus operations the company may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges at december 31 2010 the company had one outstanding floatingtofloating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of 50 million in exchange for chf 651 million which matures on february 15 2011 this transaction hedges a portion of the company’s net investment in nonus operations the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings the fair values at december 31 2010 reflected losses of 198 million and 133 million due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 

 

certain individual operating companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging programs the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of nonus operating companies in which the majority of all costs are localcurrency based a change of 5 or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the translation of the company’s balance sheet or statement of operations

business strategy 

 

the company operates with certain fundamental business strategies first it seeks to acquire and own businesses that manufacture proprietary engineered industrial products and are leaders in four broad markets industrial products engineered systems fluid management and electronic technologies to ensure success dover companies place strong emphasis on new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets second the company’s businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital third the company is committed to an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness fourth the company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a balanced manner to grow its businesses and to increase shareholder value 

 

management philosophy 

 

the company’s operating structure of four defined industry segments and six core business platforms within those segments drives focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of the company’s executive talent the presidents of the company’s operating companies and groups have responsibility for their businesses’ performance as they are able to serve customers by focusing closely on their products and markets and reacting quickly to customer needs the company’s segment and executive management set strategic direction and initiatives provide oversight allocate and manage capital are responsible for major acquisitions and provide other services 

 

in addition the company is committed to creating value for its customers employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and the development of products that help its customers meet their sustainability goals dover companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow 

 

company goals 

 

the company is committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives first the company is committed to achieving annual sales growth of 7 to 10 which includes 4 to 5 throughcycle organic growth the balance of sales growth is expected to be achieved from disciplined acquisitions secondly the company continues to focus on margin improvement activities and to expand return on invested capital to effectuate earnings per share growth ranging from 10 to 13 on an annual basis lastly the company is committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales in excess of 10 through disciplined capital allocation and active working capital management the company supports these goals through 1 alignment of management compensation with these objectives 2 a well defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and 3 talent development programs 

 

portfolio development 

 

acquisitions 

 

the company’s acquisition program has two elements first it seeks to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden its existing companies and their global reach manufacture innovative components and equipment specialty systems andor support services and sell to industrial or commercial users second in the right circumstances it will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement its existing companies or allow the company to pursue a new platform during the period from 2007 through 2009 the company purchased 17 businesses with an aggregate cost of 6058 million 

 

in 2009 the company acquired six addon businesses for aggregate consideration of 2284 million including 64 million of consideration paid in the form of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of inproseal company in 2008 the company acquired four addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 1038 million and in 2007 the company acquired seven addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 2736 million 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company’s future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of the company’s current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while the company expects to generate annual organic growth of 4  5 over a business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year 

 

dispositions 

 

while the company generally expects to hold and integrate businesses that it buys it continually reviews its portfolio to verify that those businesses continue to be essential contributors to the company’s longterm growth strategy occasionally the company may also make an opportunistic sale of one of its companies based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations during the past three years 2007 2009 the company decided to reduce its exposure to small lower margin operations and accordingly it discontinued 7 operations and sold 10 businesses for an aggregate consideration of approximately 1873 million for more details see the “discontinued operations” discussion below and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

raw materials 

 

the company’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while the needed raw materials are generally available commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities the company has generally kept pace with or exceeded raw material cost increases using effective pricing strategies during 2009 the company generally experienced decreases in commodity prices 

 

research and development 

 

the company’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2009 1783 million of expense was incurred for research and development including qualified engineering costs compared with 1892 million and 1932 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

our operating companies in the product identification platform and electronic technologies segment expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high the companies that develop product identification equipment and specialty electronic components for the life sciences datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

 

the company’s other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the product identification platform and the electronic technologies segment 

 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

 

the company owns many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of the company’s intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of the company’s intangible assets relate to customer relationships while the company’s intellectual property and customer relationships are important to its success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any group of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect the company on a consolidated basis the company believes that its companies’ commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to their general leadership positions in the niche markets that they serve 

 

seasonality 

 

in general dover companies while not strongly seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly companies serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets companies serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends 

 

customers 

 

dover’s companies serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated revenue in 2009 similarly within each of the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segment’s revenue in 2009 

 

with respect to the engineered systems fluid management and industrial products segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies supplying the waste handling construction agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products as well as services applicable to a broad range of end use applications 

 

certain companies within the electronic technologies segment serve the military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure markets their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers of these companies within the electronic technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers many of the largest global ems companies particularly in china and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers 

backlog 

 

backlog generally is not a significant longterm success factor in most of the company’s businesses as most of the products of dover companies have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to those businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the mobile equipment platform within the industrial products segment total company backlog as of december 31 2009 and 2008 was 10835 million and 11560 million respectively this reflects the decrease in global economic activity experienced during the latter half of 2008 which began to stabilize in the latter half of 2009 

 

competition 

 

the company’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation dover companies usually have more significant competitors domestically where their principal markets are than in nonus markets however dover companies are becoming increasingly global where more competitors exist 

 

certain companies in the electronic technologies and engineered systems segments compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and the far east 

 

international 

 

for nonus revenue and an allocation of the assets of the company’s continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions the company continues to increase its expansion into international markets including south america asia and eastern europe 

 

most of the company’s nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are based in france germany the united kingdom the netherlands sweden switzerland and with increased emphasis china malaysia india mexico brazil and eastern europe 

 

environmental matters 

 

the company believes its companies’ operations generally are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance the company believes that continued compliance will not have a material impact on the company’s financial position and will not require significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves 

 

employees 

 

the company had approximately 29300 employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2009 which was a decline of approximately 9 from the prior year end reflecting the company’s restructuring activities in response to an overall global economic slowdown 

 

other information 

 

the company makes available through the “financial reports” link on its internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom the company’s annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports the company posts each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on the company’s internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the company’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause its actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results in general the company is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural 

disasters and their effect on global energy markets continued events in the middle east and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks facing the company 

 

the company has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it considers material 

 

  

in 2010 the company’s businesses may continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which the company operates these circumstances will also impact the company’s suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on the company’s business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce such negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond the company’s control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on the company’s revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

 

  

the company’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies compete with only a few companies the ability of dover’s companies to compete effectively depends on how successfully they anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by their competitors changes in customer preferences and pricing pressures if dover’s companies are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors they could lose customers to competitors if dover’s companies do not compete effectively dover companies may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

certain dover companies particularly in the electronic technologies segment sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive the companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands also a meaningful portion of the electronic technologies segment’s revenue is derived from companies that are subject to unpredictable shortterm business cycles 

 

the energy platform in the fluid management segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of energy prices although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands in addition certain dover businesses manufacture products that are used in or related to residential and commercial construction which can be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new housing starts and other construction markets 

 

as a result of all the above factors the revenue and operating performance of these companies in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods and these factors could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

  

dover’s companies purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in their manufacturing operations which exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these 

commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain dover companies while the company’s businesses generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or they may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect the ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows

the company is continually evaluating its cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across its operations if the company is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its various programs it could adversely affect the company’s operating profits and cash flows

dover companies own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products dover companies employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of dover’s companies and have a negative impact on their revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

the company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden its existing companies and their global reach as well as in the right circumstances strategically pursuing larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement its existing companies or allow the company to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that the company will find suitable businesses to purchase or that the associated price would be acceptable if the company is unsuccessful in its acquisition efforts then its ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated or require the payment of additional expenses for assumed liabilities further failure to allocate capital appropriately could also result in over exposure in certain markets and geographies these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on the company’s operating profits and cash flows the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected time frame could also have an adverse affect on our results of operations

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and it is anticipated to be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established

special note regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 1a “risk factors” and in “special notes regarding forwardlooking statements” inside the front cover of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

 

cash and equivalents of 7144 million at december 31 2009 increased by 1670 million from the prior year balance of 5474 million cash and equivalents were invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturity of 90 days or less shortterm investments consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates between three months and one year shortterm investments of 2238 million as of december 31 2009 decreased by 557 million from the prior year balance of 2795 million 

 

the company’s total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balance of 9382 million at december 31 2009 includes 8138 million held outside of the united states 

 

the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities for 2009 decreased 2084 million from the prior year primarily reflecting lower earnings on reduced sales from continuing operations and increased contributions to employee benefit plans partially offset by improvements in working capital 

 

cash used in investing activities during 2009 decreased 1951 million compared to 2008 largely reflecting reduced capital expenditures and net purchases of shortterm investments partially offset by higher acquisition costs and higher proceeds from the sale of a business in 2008 cash acquisition spending was 2220 million excluding 64 million of consideration paid in the form of common stock during 2009 compared to 1038 million in the prior year capital expenditures during 2009 decreased 317 to 1200 million compared to 1758 million in the prior year due to discretionary management spend in response to the economic environment the company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2010 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper use of established lines of credit or public debt markets capital expenditures during 2010 are expected to be approximately 23 to 25 of revenue 

cash used in financing activities during 2009 decreased 1710 million compared to the prior year primarily driven by the absence of share repurchases versus the prior year and reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by debt repayments and higher dividend payments in 2009 

 

share repurchases 

 

the company had no share repurchases in 2009 in may 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10000000 shares through may 2012 approximately 89 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this five year authorization as of december 31 2009 

 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2008 pursuant to a separate 500 million share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company repurchased 10000000 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of 4615 per share as of december 31 2008 the company had completed the purchases of all shares authorized under this 500 million share repurchase program 

 

adjusted working capital 

 

adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable decreased from the prior year by 1833 million or 144 to 10926 million which reflected a decrease in receivables of 1344 million a decrease in net inventory of 653 million and a decrease in accounts payable of 164 million generally due to active working capital management in a lower revenue environment excluding acquisitions dispositions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of 211 million adjusted working capital would have decreased by 2462 million or 193 “average annual adjusted working capital” as a percentage of revenue a nongaap measure calculated as the fivequarter average balance of accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue increased to 199 at december 31 2009 from 183 at december 31 2008 and inventory turns were 62 at december 31 2009 compared to 71 at december 31 2008 

 

in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows the company also measures free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt pay dividends fund acquisitions and repurchase the company’s common stock for further information see nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

 

free cash flow 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2009 was 6821 million or 118 of revenue compared to 8346 million or 110 of revenue in the prior year the 2009 decrease in free cash flow reflects lower earnings from continuing operations and higher employee benefit contributions partially offset by improvements in working capital and a decrease in capital expenditures as compared to the prior year the increase in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue is due to active management of adjusted working capital in a lower revenue environment 

 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities 

 

 

 

at december 31 2009 the company’s net property plant and equipment totaled 8289 million compared to 8721 million at the end of 2008 the decrease in net property plant and equipment reflected depreciation of 1596 million and disposals of 217 million partially offset by capital expenditures of 1200 million acquisitions of 116 million and 123 million related to foreign currency fluctuations 

the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a 2407 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of 2223 million at yearend 2009 this resulted primarily from a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and other carryforwards 

 

the company’s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits increased by 310 million in 2009 the increase was due primarily to interest costs of 376 million benefits earned of 202 million currency changes of 103 million business acquisitions of 72 million a net actuarial loss of 71 million and other changes partially offset by benefits paid of 545 million in 2009 plan assets increased 569 million primarily due to company contributions of 775 million investment returns of 240 million currency and other changes amounting to 72 million partially offset by 545 million in benefits paid during the year it is anticipated that the company’s defined and supplemental retirement benefits expense will decrease from 365 million in 2009 to approximately 324 million in 2010 

 

the company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

 

 

the total debt level of 18609 million at december 31 2009 decreased 2248 million from december 31 2008 due to repayment of commercial paper borrowings of 1928 million and a decrease in longterm debt of 320 million net debt at december 31 2009 decreased 3361 million as a result of the decrease in total debt a decrease in adjusted working capital and the absence of share repurchases in 2009 

 

the company’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 18609 million on december 31 2009 and a fair value of approximately 19546 million on december 31 2008 the company’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 18929 million and a fair value of approximately 20185 million 

 

the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase the company’s debt however management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company’s various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

management is not aware of any potential deterioration to the company’s liquidity under the company’s 1 billion 5year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which expires in november 2012 the company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 35 to 1 the company was in compliance with this covenant and its other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2009 and had a coverage ratio of 91 to 1 it is anticipated that in 2010 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper given the current economic conditions the company fully expects to remain in compliance with all of its debt covenants 

 

the company periodically enters into financial transactions specifically to hedge its exposures to various items including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk through various programs the 

company hedges its cash flow exposures to foreign exchange rate risk by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts and collars the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial instruments 

 

the company’s longterm debt with a book value of 18609 million includes 356 million which matures in less than one year and had a fair value of approximately 19546 million at december 31 2009 the estimated fair value of the longterm debt is based on quoted market prices and present value techniques used to value similar instruments 

 

during the second quarter ended june 30 2008 the company repaid its 150 million 625 notes due june 1 2008 in addition on march 14 2008 the company issued 350 million of 545 notes due 2018 and 250 million of 660 notes due 2038 the net proceeds of 5941 million from the notes were used to repay borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program and were reflected in longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 the notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of the company in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that includes a makewhole premium with accrued interest to the redemption date 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 dover entered into several interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt financing completed on march 14 2008 which upon settlement resulted in a net gain of 12 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the lives of the related notes 

 

there is an outstanding swap agreement for a total notional amount of 500 million or chf651 million which swaps the us 6month libor rate and the swiss franc 6month libor rate this agreement hedges a portion of the company’s net investment in nonus operations and the fair value outstanding at december 31 2009 includes a loss of 133 million which was based on quoted market prices for similar instruments uses level 2 inputs under the asc 820 hierarchy this hedge is effective 

 

during the third quarter of 2008 the company entered into a foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the quarter in anticipation of a potential acquisition which did not occur as a result of terminating the hedge the company recorded a gain of 24 million in the third quarter ended september 30 2008 

 

at december 31 2008 the company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through december 2009 related to cash flow and fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures the fair values of these contracts were based on quoted market prices for identical instruments as of december 31 2008 uses level 1 inputs asc 820 hierarchy

consolidated results of operations 

 

 

 

revenue 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 24 compared to 2008 due to decreases experienced across all four segments primarily driven by a 8377 million or 34 decrease at industrial products and a 4431 million or 26 decrease at fluid management as a result of lower demand and sales volume stemming from general unfavorable economic conditions revenue decreased at engineered systems by 1484 million or 7 due to lower sales volume in core businesses which was offset by the incremental revenue from the 2009 acquisitions overall the company’s organic revenue growth decreased 239 with an unfavorable decrease in foreign exchange of 17 partially offset by a favorable impact of 19 in net growth from acquisitions gross profit decreased 23 to 20991 million from 2008 while the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 363 and 361 in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

selling and administrative expenses 

 

selling and administrative expenses of 15111 million for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 1896 million over the comparable 2008 period primarily due to decreased revenue activity cost curtailment efforts and integration programs partially offset by restructuring charges selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 26 from 22 in the prior year reflecting reduced revenue levels and restructuring charges of 502 million 

 

interest expense net 

 

interest expense net increased 5 to 1004 million for 2009 compared to 960 million for 2008 primarily due to lower average outstanding commercial paper balances during the period more than offset by cash and investments that were reinvested at lower interest rates during the later part of the year interest expense for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 was 1162 million and 1302 million respectively interest income for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 was 158 million and 342 million respectively 

 

other expense income net 

 

other expense income net for 2009 and 2008 of 40 million and 127 million respectively was driven primarily related to the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other the company’s functional currency 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rates for continuing operations for 2009 was 244 compared to the prior year rate of 266 the effective tax rate for 2009 was improved by 316 million of net benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled primarily in the second and fourth quarters of 2009 the effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by 263 million of net benefits recognized for tax positions that were primarily settled in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 the full year 2009 rate reflects the favorable impact of benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled and the favorable impact of a higher percentage of nonus earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions 

 

net earnings 

 

net earnings for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 were 3564 million or 191 dilutive earnings per share “eps” including a loss from discontinued operations of 155 million or 008 eps compared to net earnings of 5908 million or 312 dilutive eps for the same period of 2008 including a loss from discontinued operations of 1039 million or 055 eps the losses from discontinued operations in 2009 include approximately 103 million net of tax related to a writedown of a business held for sale the losses from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflect a loss provision for a business held for sale as well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing federal tax settlements and state tax assessments refer to note 3 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

 

in addition to these factors earnings across all platforms were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges as noted below partially offset by benefits captured from business restructuring and integration programs completed to date 

severance and exit reserves 

 

the company’s synergy capture programs and the restructuring initiatives launched during 2008 were continued throughout 2009 the company was able to respond to the economic downturn through strategic restructuring efforts undertaken by management which yielded savings of approximately 125 million in 2009 the 2010 benefits from these restructuring efforts are expected to range from 30 million to 40 million during 2009 the company had a net reduction in its workforce of approximately 2950 or 9 and a net reduction of 23 manufacturing and warehouse facilities the company does not anticipate a significant reduction to its workforce in 2010 and will continue to monitor business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity as necessary pending the economic climate 

 

from time to time the company has initiated various restructuring programs at its operating companies as noted above and has recorded severance and other restructuring costs in connection with purchase accounting for acquisitions prior to january 1 2009 

 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 the company had reserves related to severance and other restructuring activities of 168 million and 310 million respectively during 2009 the company recorded 721 million in additional charges and made 668 million in payments and 195 million of noncash writedowns related to reserve balances for 2009 approximately 219 million and 502 million of restructuring charges were recorded in cost of goods and services and selling and administrative expenses respectively in the consolidated statements of operations during 2008 the company recorded 274 million in additional charges and 56 million in purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions partially offset by other noncash writedowns of 23 million and payments of 281 million 

 

current economic environment 

 

with few exceptions the company experienced lower demand across all of its end markets resulting in lower bookings and backlog in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the first half of 2009 with modest improvements in certain segments in the second half of 2009 although this downturn had a significant adverse impact on revenue and earnings for the year the company maintained doubledigit margin levels and generated free cash flow in excess of 10 as a percentage of revenue the structural changes made over the last few years becoming less dependent on capital goods markets and having greater recurring revenue together with improved working capital management and strong pricing discipline partially offset the impact of the economic downturn during 2009 as discussed above in the liquidity and capital resources section the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates 

 

2010 outlook 

 

the company estimates full year organic growth to be in the range of 4 to 6 inclusive of a foreign currency impact of 1 and acquisition related growth to be around 3 for transactions completed in 2009 based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations the company has projected that its diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of 235 to 265 and expects its earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters the company also remains focused on key initiatives including the corporate development program post merger integration process and supply chain initiative among others 

segment results of operations 

 

industrial products 

 

 

 

 

  

industrial products revenue and earnings decreased by 34 and 53 respectively as compared to the prior year primarily due to general economic conditions as well as the continued downturn in infrastructure energy and transportation markets the segment decline in revenue primarily reflected a core business decrease of 33 and an unfavorable impact of 10 due to foreign exchange earnings and margin were impacted by decreased revenue and 175 million in restructuring charges the segment has experienced modest improvement in commercial activity across markets served during the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

material handling revenue and earnings decreased 42 and 73 respectively when compared to the prior year the platform experienced significant challenges in its core infrastructure automotive construction equipment and energy markets which were partially offset by an increase in military demand the decrease in revenue coupled with restructuring charges of 110 million negatively impacted earnings although bookings are down 47 as compared to 2008 the platforms served end markets have stabilized in the fourth quarter

operating structure 

 

the company reports its results in four business segments — industrial products engineered systems fluid management and electronic technologies dover discusses its operations at the platform level within the industrial products engineered systems and fluid management segments each of which contains two platforms electronic technologies’ results are discussed at the segment level dover companies within its business segments and platforms design manufacture assemble andor service the following 

 

  

business strategy 

 

the company operates with certain fundamental business strategies first it seeks to acquire and own businesses that manufacture proprietary engineered industrial products and are leaders in four broad markets industrial products engineered systems fluid management and electronic technologies to ensure success dover companies place strong emphasis on new product development to better serve customers and expand into 

new product and geographic markets second the company’s businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital third the company is committed to an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness fourth the company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a balanced manner to grow its businesses and to increase shareholder value 

 

management philosophy 

 

the company’s operating structure of four defined industry segments and six core business platforms drives focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of dover’s executive talent the presidents of dover’s operating companies and groups have responsibility for their businesses’ performance as they are able to serve customers by focusing closely on their products and markets and by reacting quickly to customer needs the company’s platform segment and executive management sets strategic direction and initiatives provides oversight allocates and manages capital is responsible for major acquisitions and provides other services 

 

portfolio development 

 

acquisitions 

 

dover’s acquisition program has two elements first it seeks to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden its existing companies and their global reach manufacture innovative components and equipment specialty systems andor support services and sell to industrial or commercial users second it will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement its existing companies or allow dover to pursue a new platform during the period from 2006 through 2008 the company purchased 18 businesses with an aggregate cost of 14942 million 

 

in 2008 the company acquired four businesses all of which were addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 1038 million in 2007 the company acquired seven businesses all of which were addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 2736 million in 2006 dover acquired seven companies five addons for an aggregate cost of 11168 million the highest annual acquisition investment level in its history 

 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company’s future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of the company’s current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while the company expects to generate annual organic growth of 5 — 7 over a business cycle sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year 

 

divestitures 

 

while the company generally expects to hold businesses that it buys it continually reviews its portfolio to verify that those businesses continue to be essential contributors to dover’s longterm growth strategy in addition occasionally dover might make an opportunistic sale of one of its companies based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations during the past three years 2006 — 2008 the company decided to reduce its exposure to companies that provide capital equipment particularly electronic assembly equipment as well as small lower margin operations and accordingly it discontinued 18 operations and sold 17 operations for an aggregate consideration of approximately 6296 million of which 4459 million was in 2006 for more details see the “discontinued operations” discussion below and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

companies that are considered discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” are presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations balance sheets and cash flows and are not included in continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations include charges when necessary to reduce these businesses to estimated fair value less costs to sell fair value is determined by either using directly observable inputs such as a negotiated selling price or other valuation techniques that use market assumptions that are reasonable and supportable all interim and full year reporting periods presented reflect the continuing operations on a comparable basis please refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on discontinued operations 

 

raw materials 

 

dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while generally available commodity pricing until recently has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities the company has generally kept pace or exceeded raw material cost increases using effective pricing strategies over the second half of 2008 the company has experienced in general decreases in commodity prices 

 

research and development 

 

dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2008 1892 million of expense was incurred for research and development including qualified engineering costs compared with 1932 million and 1689 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

for the product identification and electronic technologies companies efforts in these areas tend to be particularly significant because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high the companies that develop product identification equipment and specialty electronic components for the life sciences datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

 

dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the product identification platform and the electronic technologies segment 

 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

 

dover companies own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of the dover companies’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of the company’s intangible assets relate to customer relationships while the dover companies’ intellectual property and customer relationships are important to their success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any groups of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect the company on a consolidated basis the company believes that its companies’ commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to their general leadership position in the niche markets that they serve 

seasonality 

 

in general dover companies while not seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly companies serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets companies serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends 

 

customers 

 

dover’s companies serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated revenue in 2008 within each of the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segment’s revenue in 2008 

 

with respect to the engineered systems fluid management and industrial products segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies supplying the waste handling construction agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products as well as services applicable to a broad range of end use applications 

 

certain companies within the electronic technologies segment serve the military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure markets their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers of these companies within the electronic technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers many of the largest global ems companies particularly in china and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers 

 

backlog 

 

backlog generally is not a significant longterm success factor in most of dover’s businesses as most of the products of dover companies have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to those businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the mobile equipment platform within the industrial products segment total company backlog as of december 31 2008 and 2007 was 11560 million and 14464 million respectively which reflected the meaningful decrease in global economic activity experienced during the latter half of 2008 which is expected to continue into 2009 

 

competition 

 

dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation dover companies usually have more significant competitors domestically where their principal markets are than in nonus markets however dover companies are becoming increasingly global where more competitors exist 

 

certain companies in the electronic technologies and engineered systems segments compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and the far east 

 

international 

 

for nonus revenue and an allocation of the assets of the company’s continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions dover continues to increase its expansion into international markets including south america asia and eastern europe 

 

most of dover’s nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are based in france germany the united kingdom the netherlands sweden switzerland and with increased emphasis china malaysia india mexico brazil and eastern europe 

 

environmental matters 

 

dover believes its companies’ operations generally are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued compliance will not have a material impact on the company’s financial position and will not require significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves 

 

employees 

 

the company had approximately 32300 employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2008 which was a decline of approximately 6 from prior year end reflecting the overall global economic slowdown 

 

other information 

 

dover makes available through the “financial reports” link on its internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom the company’s annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports dover posts each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on the company’s internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

dover’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered the only risks facing the company the structure of dover and the many different markets its companies serve mitigate the possibility that any single risk factor will materially impact dover’s consolidated financial position 

 

in general dover is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic industry andor market conditions and growth rates the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global energy markets continued events in the middle east and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy and changes in laws or accounting rules the company has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it considers material 

 

  

in 2009 dover’s businesses will be adversely affected by disruptions in financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which the company operates these circumstances will also impact the company’s suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on the company’s business operations particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce such negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond the company’s control are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on the company’s revenue earnings cash flows and cost of capital 

  

dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies are market leaders that compete with only a few companies the ability of dover’s companies to compete effectively will depend on how successfully they anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new products and services that may be introduced by their competitors changes in customer preferences and pricing pressures if dover’s companies are unable to anticipate their competitor’s development of new products and services andor identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis they could lose customers to competitors if dover’s companies do not compete effectively or if new products and services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace dover companies may experience lower revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

certain dover companies particularly in the electronic technologies segment sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed in order to grow and remain competitive the companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands also a meaningful portion of the electronic technologies segment’s revenue is derived from companies which are subject to unpredictable shortterm business cycles 

 

the energy platform in the fluid management segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of energy prices although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands in addition certain of dover’s businesses manufacture products that are used in or related to residential and commercial construction which can be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new housing starts and other construction markets 

 

as a result of all the above factors the revenue and operating performance of these companies in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods and could have a material impact on dover’s consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

  

dover’s companies purchase raw materials subassemblies and components for use in their manufacturing operations which exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain dover companies while dover’s businesses generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products or they may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors in addition while raw materials are generally available now the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect the ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products consequently a significant price increase in raw materials or their unavailability may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

approximately 45 of dover’s revenue is derived outside of the united states and the company continues to focus on penetrating new global markets as part of its overall growth strategy this global expansion strategy is subject to but 

not limited to the following risks and uncertainties political social and economic instability and disruptions government embargoes or trade restrictions the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers import and export controls increased compliance costs transportation delays and disruptions and difficulties in staffing and managing multinational organizations in addition foreign currency fluctuations particularly the appreciation of the us dollar against european currencies generally has an adverse affect on exports and the related revenue and earnings as a result if the company is unable to successfully mitigate these risks they could have an adverse affect on the company’s growth strategy as it relates to expanding into new geographic markets and its results of operations and financial position 

 

  

dover is continually evaluating its cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across its operations if the company is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its various programs it could adversely affect the company’s operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

dover’s domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws including environmental and export laws regulations and policies failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties as well as potential damage to the company’s reputation in addition the company cannot provide assurance that its costs of complying with current or future laws including environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed its estimates in addition dover has invested in certain countries including brazil russia india and china that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect dover’s businesses and reputation 

 

dover’s effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated the company’s financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments 

 

  

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses divert management’s attention and the company may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect its financial condition in addition any insurance or indemnification rights that the company may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect it against potential loss exposures 

 

  

dover companies own patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products the company employs various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property these measures may not prevent these items from being challenged invalidated or circumvented particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected unauthorized use of these intellectual 

property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of dover’s companies and have a negative impact on their revenue operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

the company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden its existing companies and their global reach as well as strategically pursuing larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing companies or allow dover to pursue a new platform however there can be no assurance that the company will find suitable businesses to purchase as a substantial number of the company’s current businesses operate in relatively mature markets or that the associated price would be acceptable if the company is unsuccessful in its acquisition efforts its ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected in addition a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated or require the payment of additional expenses for assumed liabilities these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on dover’s operating profits and cash flows 

 

  

three major ratings agencies moody’s standard and poor’s and fitch evaluate dover’s credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for dover’s longterm debt as of december 31 2008 a2 a and a respectively in january 2009 fitch reaffirmed its credit rating for dover with a negative outlook while the ratings and outlooks from the other agencies remained unchanged although the company does not anticipate a material change in its credit ratings if the company’s current credit ratings deteriorate its borrowing costs and access to sources of liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

  

dover currently anticipates that 2009 revenue will decline 1113 below 2008 levels and currently does not anticipate a recovery in the latter half of 2009 from these demand levels based on these assumptions dover has projected that its continuing diluted earnings per share for 2009 will be in the range of 275 to 305 and expects its earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters if global or domestic economic conditions deteriorate further dover’s operating results for 2009 could be materially worse than projected

the facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted 

 

during 2008 the company ceased operations in 19 locations and has announced plans in 2009 to cease operations in several additional locations reflecting the current economic climate these reductions and plant consolidations will not restrict the company’s ability to meet customer needs should economic conditions improve materially late in 2009 and in 2010

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and is anticipated to be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established 

 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of the use of products of dover companies exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves in the opinion of management based on these reviews it is unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend  

special note regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes which appear elsewhere in the form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 1a “risk factors” and in “special notes regarding forwardlooking statements” inside the front cover of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

 

the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities during 2008 increased 827 million over the prior year primarily reflecting higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization lower tax payments in 2008 and lower receivables partially offset by higher pension contributions 

 

cash used in investing activities during 2008 increased 1209 million compared to 2007 largely due to the purchase of shortterm investments partially offset by lower spending on acquisitions in 2008 acquisition expenditures in 2008 were 1038 million compared to 2736 million in 2007 while proceeds from the disposition of businesses were essentially flat at 928 million up 18 million from 910 million in 2007 capital expenditures of 1758 million were generally consistent with the prior year level of 1737 million the company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2009 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper established lines of credit or public debt markets capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to be approximately 30 to 40 below 2008 levels 

 

cash used in financing activities during 2008 increased 2152 million compared to 2007 reflecting higher repayments of commercial paper and longterm debt partially offset by 5941 million in proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt and lower cash spent on share repurchases in the 2008 period 

 

share repurchases 

 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2008 the company repurchased 10000000 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of 4615 per share as of december 31 2008 the company had completed the purchases of all shares authorized under its 500 million share repurchase program which was approved by the board of directors in the fourth quarter of 2007 

during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 the board of directors approved two separate share repurchase programs authorizing repurchases of approximately 20000000 common shares through the end of 2008 the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement on august 2 2007 “asr” under which it purchased 6000000 shares of its common stock at an initial purchase price of 5164 per share upon final settlement of this asr in the fourth quarter of 2007 the final economic purchase price was 4836 per share representing an average of the volume weighted average price of the company’s common stock during the outstanding period less a negotiated discount amount in addition during 2007 the company made other open market purchases of its common stock totaling 64 million shares at an average price of 4678 per share 

 

adjusted working capital 

 

adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable decreased from the prior year end by 860 million or 6 to 12759 million which reflected a decrease in receivables of 910 million a decrease in inventory of 378 million and a decrease in accounts payable of 428 million excluding acquisitions of 184 million dispositions of 96 million and the effects of foreign exchange translation of 385 million adjusted working capital would have decreased by 563 million or 4 “average annual adjusted working capital” as a percentage of revenue a nongaap measure calculated as the fivequarter average balance of accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue decreased to 183 at december 31 2008 from 189 at december 31 2007 and inventory turns were 71 at december 31 2008 compared to 67 at december 31 2007 

 

in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows the company also measures free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase dover’s common stock for further information see nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2008 was 8346 million or 110 of revenue compared to 7540 million or 103 of revenue in the prior year the 2008 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments in 2008 and lower receivables and inventory partially offset by higher pension contributions 

 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities 

 

 

 

at december 31 2008 the company’s net property plant and equipment totaled 8721 million compared to 8922 million at the end of 2007 the decrease in net property plant and equipment reflected depreciation and disposals partially offset by capital expenditures of 1758 million acquisitions of 50 million and 170 million related to foreign currency fluctuations 

 

the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a 2412 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of 2407 million at yearend 2008 this resulted primarily from a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and pension assets partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and accrued expenses 

 

dover’s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits decreased by 169 million in 2008 the decrease was due primarily to currency rate changes partially offset by actuarial losses in 2008 plan assets decreased by 947 million primarily due to losses on plan investments and currency fluctuations during 

the year partially offset by company and employee contributions it is estimated that the company’s defined and supplemental retirement benefits expense will increase from 357 million in 2008 to approximately 364 million in 2009 

 

the company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

 

 

the total debt level of 20857 million at december 31 2008 decreased 50 million from december 31 2007 due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by an increase in longterm debt net debt at december 31 2008 decreased 2257 million as a result of higher cash generated from operations the percentage decrease in net debt to total capital after 462 million of share repurchases reflects strong free cash flow and proceeds from dispositions of 928 million 

 

dover’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 18929 million on december 31 2008 and a fair value of approximately 20185 million on december 31 2007 the company’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 14852 million and a fair value of approximately 14960 million 

 

the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase the company’s debt however management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company’s various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

management is not aware of any potential impairment to the company’s liquidity under the company’s 1 billion 5year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which expires in november of 2012 the company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 35 to 1 the company was in compliance with this covenant and its other longterm debt covenants at december 31 2008 and had a coverage ratio of 135 to 1 it is anticipated that in 2009 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper given the current economic conditions the company fully expects to remain in compliance with all of its debt covenants 

 

the company periodically enters into financial transactions specifically to hedge its exposures to various items including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk through various programs the company hedges its cash flow exposures to foreign exchange rate risk by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts and collars the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial instruments 

during the first quarter of 2008 dover entered into several interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt financing completed on march 14 2008 which upon settlement resulted in a net gain of 12 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the lives of the related notes 

 

there is presently one outstanding swap agreement for a total notional amount of 500 million or chf651 million which swaps the us 6month libor rate and the swiss franc 6month libor rate this agreement hedges a portion of the company’s net investment in nonus operations and the fair value outstanding at december 31 2008 was a loss of 120 million which was based on quoted market prices for similar instruments uses level 2 inputs under the sfas no 157 hierarchy this hedge is effective 

 

during the third quarter of 2008 the company entered into a foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the quarter in anticipation of a potential acquisition which did not occur as a result of terminating the hedge the company recorded a gain of 24 million in the third quarter ended september 30 2008 

 

at december 31 2008 the company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through december 2009 related to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures the fair values of these contracts were based on quoted market prices for identical instruments as of december 31 2008 uses level 1 inputs under the sfas no 157 hierarchy

severance and exit reserves 

 

from time to time the company will initiate various restructuring programs at its operating companies or record severance and exit costs in connection with purchase accounting for acquisitions during the latter half of 2008 the company announced plans to increase the amount of restructuring efforts in response to the significant decline in global economic activity at december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had reserves related to severance and exit activities of 310 million and 284 million respectively during 2008 the company recorded 274 million in additional charges and 56 million in purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions partially offset by other noncash writedowns of 23 million and payments of 281 million these costs yielded a savings of approximately 350 million in 2008 the company expects further restructuring plans to occur in 2009 resulting in costs of approximately 400 million that the company expects will yield savings of approximately 750 million in 2009 restructuring charges are recorded primarily in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations

current economic environment 

 

with few exceptions dover experienced lower demand across all of its end markets resulting in lower bookings and backlog in the fourth quarter of 2008 looking forward to 2009 a continuation of a weak and uncertain global business environment is expected though this downturn will have a significant adverse impact on revenue and earnings dover remains committed to maintaining margin levels as much as possible on a full year basis although the company expects the first quarter to be weak in part due to significant ongoing restructuring efforts the structural changes made over the last few years becoming less dependent on capital goods markets and having greater recurring revenue together with improved working capital management and strong pricing discipline is expected to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn during 2009 as discussed above in the liquidity and capital resources section the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates 

 

the company’s synergy capture programs and the restructuring initiatives launched during 2008 will continue into 2009 during 2008 dover reduced its workforce approximately 6 and expects to reduce its workforce further in 2009 by another 5 during 2009 the company will monitor business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity as necessary should the economic environment worsen the company will also remain focused on working capital levels and expects to generate strong free cash flow during 2009

 item 1   business tableend  

overview 

 

dover corporation “dover” or the “company” incorporated in 1947 in the state of delaware became a publicly traded company in 1955 the company owns and operates a global portfolio of manufacturing companies providing innovative components and equipment specialty systems and support services for a variety of applications in the industrial products engineered systems fluid management and electronic technologies markets additional information is contained in items 7 and 8 

 

recent events 

 

in the fall of 2004 the company embarked on a strategic portfolio review looking at all of its companies to determine whether every company warranted continued ownership and investment as part of that process the company elected to expand its executive management team and changed its operating structure to accommodate both the strategic review and expanded leadership this resulted in the creation of six segments and 13 platforms effective october 1 2004 over the next three years as a result of the strategic review dover decided to discontinue and sell 22 businesses with annual revenue of approximately 13 billion and aggregate operating margins of 5 generating net proceeds of 696 million at the same time the company spent 25 billion acquiring 24 businesses with expected annual revenue of 14 billion and projected operating margins of 15 

 

as a result of these actions in the third quarter of 2007 the company elected to change its operating structure to more logically align its businesses with respect to end markets resulting in the creation of four segments and six platforms which is expected to be the ongoing operating structure for the foreseeable future 

 

operating structure 

 

the company reports its results in four business segments — industrial products engineered systems fluid management and electronic technologies dover discusses its operations at the platform level within the industrial products engineered systems and fluid management segments each of which contains two platforms electronic technologies’ results are discussed at the segment level dover companies within its business segments and platforms design manufacture assemble andor service the following 

 

 2 

fluid transfer applications quick disconnect couplings used in a wide variety of biomedical and commercial applications and chemical proportioning and dispensing systems 

 

  

business strategy 

 

the company operates with certain fundamental business strategies first it seeks to acquire and own businesses which manufacture proprietary engineered industrial products which are leaders in four broad markets industrial products engineered systems fluid management and electronic technologies to ensure success dover companies place strong emphasis on new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets second the company drives its businesses to be committed to operational excellence and to be market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital third the company is committed to an operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness fourth the company seeks to utilize its strong free cash flow in a balanced manner to grow its businesses and to increase shareholder value 

 

management philosophy 

 

the company’s operating structure of four defined industry segments and six core business platforms drives focused acquisition activity accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies including global sourcing and supply chain integration and advances the development of dover’s executive talent the presidents of dover’s operating companies and groups have responsibility for their businesses’ performance as they are able to serve customers by focusing closely on their products and markets and by reacting quickly to customer needs the company’s platform segment and executive management sets strategic direction provides oversight allocates and manages capital assists in major acquisitions and provides other services 

 

portfolio development 

 

acquisitions 

 

dover’s acquisition program has two elements first it seeks to acquire value creating addon businesses that broaden its existing platforms and global reach manufacture innovative components and equipment specialty systems andor support services and sell to industrial or commercial users second it will strategically pursue larger standalone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing companies or allow dover to pursue a new platform during the period from 2005 through 2007 the company significantly increased the level of acquisition spending buying 24 businesses with an aggregate cost of 25 billion annualized revenue of these companies was approximately 14 billion as of their date of acquisition with projected operating margins in the range of 15 

 

in 2007 the company acquired seven businesses all of which were addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 2736 million in 2006 dover acquired seven companies five addons for an aggregate cost of 11168 million the highest annual acquisition investment level in its history during 2005 the company acquired a total of ten businesses eight addons for an aggregate cost of 10897 million 

 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company’s future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of the company’s current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while the company expects all of its businesses to generate annual organic growth of 5 — 7 over a business cycle sustained organic growth at these levels is difficult to achieve consistently each year 

divestitures 

 

while the company generally expects to hold businesses that it buys during the past three years 2005 — 2007 the company engaged in a thorough review of its portfolio of businesses to verify that those businesses continue to be essential contributors to dover’s longterm growth strategy based on that review the company has over the past three years discontinued 22 and sold 20 operations for an aggregate consideration of approximately 696 million in addition there are occasionally situations in which one of dover’s companies is a very attractive acquisition for another company based on specific market conditions in those circumstances dover might make an opportunistic sale for more details see the “discontinued operations” discussion below and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

raw materials 

 

dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits while generally available commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years particularly for various grades of steel copper aluminum and select other commodities the company has generally kept pace or exceeded raw material cost increases using pricing strategies 

 

research and development 

 

dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2007 2126 million was spent on research and development including qualified engineering costs compared with 1550 million and 1447 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

for the product identification and electronic technologies companies efforts in these areas tend to be particularly significant because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high the companies that develop product identification equipment and specialty electronic components for the life sciences datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the product identification platform and the electronic technologies segment 

 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

 

dover companies own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of the dover companies’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of the company’s intangible assets relate to customer relationships while the dover companies’ intellectual property and customer relationships are important to their success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any groups of related rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect the company on a consolidated basis the company believes that its companies’ commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to their general leadership position in the niche markets that they serve 

 

seasonality 

 

in general dover companies while not seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly companies serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets companies serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends 

 

customers 

 

dover’s companies serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated revenue in 2007 within each of the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segment’s revenue in 2007 

 

with respect to the engineered systems fluid management and industrial products segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies supplying the waste handling construction agricultural defense energy automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products as well as services applicable to a broad range of end use applications 

 

certain companies within the electronic technologies segment serve the military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure markets their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers of these companies within the electronic technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers many of the largest global ems companies particularly in china and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers 

 

backlog 

 

backlog generally is not a significant longterm success factor in most of dover’s businesses as most of the products of dover companies have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to those businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the mobile equipment platform within the industrial products segment and in the testing equipment and components business in the electronic technologies segment total company backlog as of december 31 2007 and 2006 was 13857 million and 12270 million respectively 

competition 

 

dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies are market leaders that compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation dover companies usually have more significant competitors domestically where their principal markets are than in nonus markets however dover companies are becoming increasingly global where more competitors exist 

 

certain companies in the electronic technologies and engineered systems segments compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and the far east 

 

international 

 

for nonus revenue and an allocation of the assets of the company’s continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and nonus governmental restrictions dover continues to increase its expansion into international markets including south america asia and eastern europe 

 

most of dover’s nonus subsidiaries and affiliates are based in france germany the united kingdom the netherlands sweden switzerland and with increased emphasis china malaysia india mexico brazil and eastern europe 

 

environmental matters 

 

dover believes its companies’ operations generally are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued compliance will not have a material impact on the company’s financial position and will not require significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves 

 

employees 

 

the company had approximately 33400 employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2007 

 

other information 

 

dover makes available through the “financial reports” link on its internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom the company’s annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports dover posts each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on the company’s internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

dover’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated see the discussion in “special notes regarding forwardlooking statements” included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

cyclical economic conditions may affect the company’s financial performance 

 

a meaningful portion of the company’s revenue most notably that from the electronic technologies segment is derived from companies that serve the global electronics markets which are subject to unpredictable shortterm business cycles as a result the revenue and operating performance of these companies in any one period are not 

necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods and could have a material impact on dover’s consolidated financial position 

 

the energy platform in the fluid management segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of energy prices although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and rig counts 

 

in addition dover is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other usbased industrial manufacturers however except as noted above the structure of dover and the many different markets its companies serve mitigates the possibility that any of these risk factors will materially impact dover’s consolidated financial position

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the subsidiary’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and is anticipated to be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established 

 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are and from time to time may become parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of products of dover companies exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves in the opinion of management based on these reviews it is unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position

liquidity and capital resources 

 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends repurchases of outstanding shares adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

 

the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities during 2007 increased 359 million over the prior year primarily reflecting higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization partially offset by higher incentive compensation interest and tax payments 

 

cash used in investing activities during 2007 decreased 5102 million compared to 2006 reflecting lower acquisition spending and capital expenditures partially offset by lower proceeds from the disposition of businesses during 2007 compared to 2006 acquisition expenditures in 2007 were 2736 million compared to 11168 million in 2006 while proceeds from the disposition of businesses were 910 million down 3549 million from 4459 million in 2006 capital expenditures of 1743 million decreased from 1907 million in the prior year and primarily funded investments in plant expansions plant machinery and information systems the company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2008 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper established lines of credit or public debt markets capital expenditures for 2008 are generally expected to be at or below 2007 levels 

 

cash used in financing activities during 2007 totaled 3457 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of 1283 million in the 2006 period the change in financing activity during 2007 primarily reflected cash used to purchase 124 million shares of dover common stock on the open market under its share repurchase program throughout 2007 for a total of 591 million a portion of these shares were acquired through an accelerated share repurchase agreement “asr” under which the company during the third quarter of 2007 purchased 6 million shares of its common stock at an initial purchase price of 5164 per share upon settlement of this asr in the fourth quarter of 2007 the final economic purchase price was 4836 per share representing an average of the volume weighted average price of the company’s common stock during the outstanding period less a negotiated discount amount the 2007 share repurchases were funded through cash from operations proceeds from the disposition of businesses and an increase in outstanding commercial paper borrowings 

adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased from the prior year end by 291 million or 2 to 13630 million which reflected an increase in receivables of 574 million a decrease in inventory of 130 million and an increase in accounts payable of 153 million excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation adjusted working capital would have decreased by 501 million or 4 average annual adjusted working capital as a percentage of revenue a nongaap measure calculated as the fivequarter average balance of accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue increased slightly to 192 at december 31 2007 from 190 at december 31 2006 

 

in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows the company also measures free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase dover’s common stock for further information see nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2007 was 7277 million or 101 of revenue compared to 6754 million or 107 of revenue in the prior year the 2007 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower capital expenditures partially offset by higher tax payments in 2007 the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities 

 

 

 

at december 31 2007 the company’s net property plant and equipment totaled 8851 million compared to 8152 million at the end of 2006 the increase in net property plant and equipment reflected capital expenditures of 1743 million acquisitions of 270 million and 250 million related to foreign currency fluctuations partially offset by depreciation and disposals 

 

the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a 2685 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of 2386 million at yearend 2007 this resulted primarily from an increase in deferred tax assets arising from accrued expenses principally for state income taxes and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets 

 

dover’s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits decreased by 310 million in 2007 the decrease was due primarily to actuarial gains benefits paid and plan amendments offset by benefits earned interest cost and currency rate changes in 2007 plan assets increased 188 million primarily due to gains on plan investments during the year and company contributions partially offset by benefits paid it is estimated that the company’s defined and supplemental retirement benefits expense will decrease from 495 million in 2007 to approximately 383 million in 2008 

 

the company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the 

following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

 

 

the total debt level of 20907 million at december 31 2007 increased 3196 million from december 31 2006 due to increased commercial paper borrowings used to fund the company’s asr program and other open market purchases of its common stock net debt at december 31 2007 increased 92 million as a result of the total debt increase partially offset by an increase in cash generated from operations the percentage increase in net debt to total capital after 591 million of share repurchases reflects strong operational free cash flow and proceeds from dispositions of 91 million 

 

dover’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 14852 million on december 31 2007 and a fair value of approximately 14960 million on december 31 2006 the company’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 15128 million and a fair value of approximately 15029 million 

 

the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending andor share repurchases could potentially increase company debt however management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company’s various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

management is not aware of any potential impairment to the company’s liquidity and the company is in compliance with all of its longterm debt covenants it is anticipated that in 2008 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper and depending upon market conditions through the issuance of longterm debt 

 

as of december 31 2007 there were two interest rate swap agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of 1000 million designated as fair value hedges on part of the company’s 4000 million 650 notes due on february 15 2011 one 50 million interest rate swap exchanges fixedrate interest for variablerate interest the other 50 million swap is designated in foreign currency and exchanges fixedrate interest for variablerate interest and also hedges a portion of the company’s net investment in international operations the swap agreements have reduced the effective interest rate on the notes to 643 there is no hedge ineffectiveness and the fair value of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2007 was determined through market quotation

the company reports its results in six reportable business segments — diversified electronics industries resources systems and technologies and discusses their operations in 13 groups which are each comprised of two or more business units diversified builds products for use in the defense aerospace and automotive aftermarket industries heat transfer equipment specialized bearings construction and agricultural cabs as well as color measurement and control systems for printing presses electronics designs and manufactures a wide variety of electronic and electromechanical components for original equipment manufacturers “oems” serving numerous end markets including hearing aids telecom infrastructure and cell phones defense and aerospace electronics and medicallife sciences in addition this segment manufactures atm hardware and software for retail applications and financial institutions and chemical proportioning and dispensing systems for janitorialsanitation applications industries produces equipment and components for use in waste handling bulk transport and automotive service industries resources manufactures products primarily for the petroleum and natural gas automotive fueling fluid handling engineered components material handling and chemical equipment industries systems manufactures refrigeration systems display cases walk in coolers food service cooking equipment and other products for the supermarketrestaurant industries in addition this segment manufactures specialized machinery for use in the beverage and food processing industries technologies builds sophisticated automated imaging and testing equipment for the electronics industry and industrial printers and consumables for coding and marking 

 

business strategy 

 

the company operates with certain fundamental strategies first it seeks to acquire and own businesses with proprietary engineered industrial products which make them leaders in the niche markets they serve to ensure success dover companies place emphasis on new product development to better serve customers and expansion into new markets to serve new customers second it expects these businesses to be committed to operational excellence and all of dover’s operating companies are expected to be market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital third the company is committed to a highly autonomous operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness 

 

management philosophy 

 

the company practices a highly decentralized management style the presidents of the operating companies within the 13 groups are given a great deal of autonomy and have a high level of independent responsibility for their businesses and their performance this is in keeping with the company’s operating philosophy that independent operations are better able to serve customers by focusing closely on their products and markets and reacting quickly to customer needs the company’s executive management role is to provide management oversight allocate and manage capital assist in major acquisitions evaluate motivate and as necessary replace operating company management and also provide selected other services 

 

acquisitions 

 

dover has a longstanding acquisition program that seeks to acquire and develop “platform” businesses that are market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital ideal acquisition candidates are generally manufacturers of high valueadded engineered products sold to a broad customer base of industrial or commercial users one of the most critical factors in the decision to acquire a 

business is the company’s judgment of the skill energy ethics and compatibility of the top executives at the acquisition target in keeping with the company’s decentralized structure dover generally expects that acquired companies will continue to be operated by the management team in place at acquisition with a high degree of autonomy during the period from 2004 through 2006 the company significantly increased the level of acquisition spending buying 25 businesses with an aggregate cost of 27090 million annualized revenue of these companies were 16000 million as of their date of acquisition with projected annualized operating margins in the range of 15 dover also changed its focus towards acquiring fewer larger businesses with better growth characteristics 

 

the company has traditionally focused on acquiring new businesses that can operate independently from other dover companies “standalones” beginning in 1993 the company began increasing the number of “addon” businesses it acquired — businesses that could be added on to existing dover companies in recent years including 2006 the company has indicated an intention to buy larger standalones while continuing to acquire “addon” businesses to enhance companies already owned 

 

in 2004 the company acquired eight addon businesses for an aggregate cost of 5025 million during 2005 the company acquired a total of ten businesses eight addons for an aggregate cost of 10897 million in 2006 dover acquired seven companies five addons for an aggregate cost of 11168 million the highest annual acquisition investment level in its history 

 

for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company’s future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of the company’s current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while the company expects all of its businesses to generate annual organic growth of 5 — 7 over a business cycle sustained organic growth at these levels is difficult to achieve consistently each year 

 

divestitures 

 

while the company generally expects to hold businesses that it buys it periodically reassesses its portfolio of businesses to verify that those businesses continue to be essential contributors to dover’s longterm growth strategy the company will strategically divest operations that cannot meet dover’s longterm performance goals in addition on occasion there are situations in which one of dover’s companies is a very attractive acquisition for another company based on specific market conditions in those circumstances dover might make an opportunistic sale based on these criteria the company has over the past six years discontinued 38 and sold 32 operations for an aggregate pretax consideration of approximately 1066 million 

 

in 2005 the company announced a formal portfolio review which was substantially completed in 2006 resulting in the discontinuance of 20 businesses of which 14 were sold by december 31 2006 these actions have resulted in aggregate pretax consideration of 6052 million received for the businesses sold which had annualized revenue of approximately 1055 million with approximately 5 operating margins this process has improved the company’s focus on key markets for longterm growth

raw materials 

 

dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits in 2004 there 

were meaningful increases in raw material costs particularly steel and higher energy costs including an estimated increase in unrecovered steel costs of approximately 35 million these increases primarily affected the company’s industrial segments in 2005 and 2006 the impact of commodity prices moderated and the operating companies have been able to substantially offset cost increases with surcharges and price increases over time 

 

research and development 

 

dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2006 1550 million was spent on research and development including qualified engineering costs compared with 1496 million and 1338 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

for the technologies and electronics companies efforts in these areas tend to be particularly significant because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high electronics companies developing specialty electronic components for the life sciences datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

 

dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the technologies and electronics businesses 

 

intellectual property and intangible assets 

 

dover companies own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of the dover companies’ intellectual property consists of patents unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate in addition a significant portion of the company’s intangible assets relate to customer relationships while the dover companies’ intellectual property and customer relationships are important to their success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships or any groups of related rights or relationships would not materially affect the company on a consolidated basis the company believes that its companies’ commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to their general leadership position in the niche markets that they serve 

 

seasonality 

 

in general operations of the dover companies while not seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly companies serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets companies serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries tend to have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends 

 

customers 

 

dover’s companies serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated revenue in 2006 one customer within the systems segment accounted for approximately 20 of systems revenue during 2006 within each of the other five segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segment’s revenue in 2006 

 

the components group within the electronics segment serves the military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure markets its customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers of the components group outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies customers of the am group within the technologies segment also include many of the largest global ems companies particularly some of the newer ems companies in china and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers 

 

in the other dover segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies supplying the hearing aid cell phone telecom automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end use applications 

 

backlog 

 

backlog generally is not a significant longterm success factor in most of dover’s businesses as most of the products of dover companies have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to those businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the diversified segment as well as the mobile equipment group within the industries segment the am group within the technologies segment and the components group within the electronics segment total company backlog as of december 31 2006 and 2005 was 13410 million and 11115 million respectively 

 

competition 

 

dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies are market leaders which compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation dover usually is a more significant competitor domestically where its principal markets are than in foreign markets however dover companies are becoming increasingly global where greater competition exists 

 

in the technologies segment dover companies compete globally against a variety of companies primarily operating in europe and the far east 

 

within the other segments competition is primarily domestic although an increasing number of dover companies see more international competitors in the markets that they serve particularly certain companies in the electronics systems resources and diversified segments 

 

international 

 

for foreign revenue including exports and an allocation of the assets of the company’s continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign governmental restrictions dover intends to increase its expansion into foreign markets including south america asia and eastern europe 

 

the countries where most of dover’s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are based are france germany the uk the netherlands sweden switzerland and with increased emphasis malaysia and china 

 

environmental matters 

 

dover believes its operations generally are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover 

believes that continued compliance will not have a material impact on the company’s financial position and will not require significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves 

 

employees 

 

the company had approximately 33000 employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2006 

 

other information 

 

dover makes available free of charge through the “financial reports” link on its internet website httpwwwdovercorporationcom the company’s annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports dover posts each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the securities and exchange commission the information on the company’s internet website is not incorporated into this form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

dover’s business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated see the discussion in “special notes regarding forwardlooking statements” included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

cyclical economic conditions may affect the company’s financial performance 

 

a meaningful portion of the company’s revenue most notably those from the am group in the technologies segment and the components group in the electronics segment is derived from companies which serve the global electronics markets that are subject to somewhat unpredictable shortterm business cycles as a result the revenue and operating performance of these companies in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods and could have a material impact on dover’s consolidated financial position 

 

the oil and gas group in the resources segment has a certain level of risk related to the volatility of energy prices although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and rig counts 

 

in addition dover is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other usbased industrial manufacturers however except as noted above the structure of dover and the many different markets its companies serve mitigate the possibility that any of these risk factors will materially impact dover’s consolidated financial position

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and is anticipated to be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established 

 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are and from time to time may be parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of products of dover companies exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves in the opinion of management based on these reviews it is very unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position

special note regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

this annual report on form 10k particularly this item 7 contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of applicable law forwardlooking statements are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks it is important that you read “special notes regarding forwardlooking statements” inside the front cover of this annual report of form 10k for more information about these forwardlooking statements and their inherent uncertainties and risks 

 

1 financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

 

the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities during 2006 increased 3085 million over the prior period primarily reflecting higher earnings and margins from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments 

 

cash used in investing activities during 2006 decreased 2025 million compared to 2005 reflecting essentially flat acquisition spending higher proceeds from the disposition of businesses in the 2006 period partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily in the oil  gas and microacoustics businesses acquisition expenditures in 2006 were 11168 million compared to 10897 million in 2005 while proceeds from the disposition of businesses increased 2866 million over 2005 to 4459 million capital expenditures of 1947 million which increased 642 million over the prior year primarily funded investments in plant expansions plant machinery and information systems the company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2007 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper established lines of credit or public debt markets capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to be consistent with 2006 levels 

 

cash provided by financing activities during 2006 decreased 1463 million when compared to 2005 acquisitions during 2006 were primarily funded through cash from operations and proceeds generated from dispositions in addition the company repurchased 483 million of treasury shares and paid dividends of 1448 million 

 

adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased from december 31 2005 by 2625 million primarily as a result of acquisitions foreign exchange translation and the company’s organic growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency working capital would have increased by 413 million from december 31 2005 average annual adjusted 

working capital as a percentage of revenue a nongaap measure calculated as the five quarter average balance of accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue decreased to 189 from 207 at year end 2005 and inventory turns improved to 65 turns from 57 turns in the prior year 

 

in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flow the company also measures free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase dover’s common stock for further information see nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2006 was 6841 million or 105 of revenue compared to 4400 million or 82 of revenue in the prior year the 2006 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings and margins from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments partially offset by higher capital expenditures the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities 

 

 

 

at december 31 2006 the company’s net property plant and equipment totaled 8568 million compared to 7067 million at the end of 2005 the increase in net property plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of 837 million capital expenditures of 1947 million partially offset by decreases related to foreign currency fluctuation of 219 million and depreciation 

 

the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a 3075 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of 2983 million at yearend 2006 this resulted primarily from decreases in current tax liabilities increases in deferred tax assets from accruals a decrease in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the adoption of sfas no 158 see below and net operating loss carryforwards primarily acquisition related partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets 

 

dover’s consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits increased by 520 million in 2006 the increase was due principally to net obligations of 505 million related to acquisitions offsetting this increase was a plan asset increase of 376 million due to gains on plan investments during the year and company contributions of 30 million which were partially offset by benefit payouts during 2006 plan amendments primarily from union negotiated contracts created an increase in the benefit obligation of 85 million due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses it is estimated that pension expense will increase from 428 million to approximately 452 million in 2007 effective december 31 2006 dover adopted sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of financial accounting standards board “fasb” statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” see notes 2  13 in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the adoption of this standard 

 

the company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation a nongaap measure to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

 

 

net debt at december 31 2006 remained relatively flat as increased cash flow from operations and cash generated from dispositions were used to fund dover’s acquisition program the percentage decrease in net debt to total capital after record acquisition spending reflects strong operational free cash flow and the proceeds from dispositions of 4459 million 

 

dover’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 15128 million on december 31 2006 and a fair value of approximately 15029 million on december 31 2005 the company’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 13454 million and a fair value of approximately 14060 million 

 

the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending could potentially increase company debt however management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company’s various cash flow requirements including acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

management is not aware of any potential impairment to the company’s liquidity and the company is in compliance with all of its longterm debt covenants it is anticipated that in 2007 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or depending upon market conditions through the issuance of longterm debt or some combination of the two 

 

as of december 31 2006 there were two interest rate swap agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of 1000 million designated as fair value hedges on part of the company’s 1500 million 625 notes due on june 1 2008 one 50 million interest rate swap exchanges fixedrate interest for variablerate interest the other 50 million swap is designated in foreign currency and exchanges fixedrate interest for variablerate interest and also hedges a portion of the company’s net investment in foreign operations the swap agreements have reduced the effective interest rate on the notes to 578 there is no hedge ineffectiveness and the fair value of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2006 was determined through market quotation 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 the company closed a structured fiveyear noninterest bearing 1651 million amortizing loan with a nonus lender which also included a participation fee received by the company of 99 million the loan was recorded at face value the company also expects to incur a total of 57 million in debt related issuance costs beginning in april 2007 the repayment schedule requires payments every april and september with the final payment to be made in july 2011 the participation fee will be amortized ratably into other expense income net over the term of the loan and is recorded in other deferrals in the consolidated balance sheet the loan agreement includes a put and call provision that can be exercised starting in june 2008 though the end of the loan term 

 

at december 31 2006 the company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through march 2007 related to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures as follows

2006 compared to 2005 

 

  consolidated results of operations 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 22 over 2005 due to increases at all six segments led by increases of 3226 million at resources and 3346 million at electronics resources revenue increased due to positive market fundamentals acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies while electronics’ revenue increased due to acquisitions and strong organic growth overall dover’s organic revenue growth was 14 acquisition growth was 8 and the impact from foreign exchange was negligible gross profit increased 25 to 23480 million from 2005 while the gross profit margin increased 80 basis points to 361 

 

selling and administrative expenses of 14362 million for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 2248 million over the comparable 2005 period primarily due to increased revenue activity and 264 million of equity compensation expense related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard 123r “share based payment” “sfas no 123r” which required companies to expense the fair value of equity compensation such as stock options and stocksettled stock appreciation rights “ssars” primarily over the related vesting period the company used the modified prospective method to adopt sfas no 123r which did 

not require the restatement of prior periods selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 221 from 227 in 2005 excluding the effect of sfas no 123r selling and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2006 would have been 14098 million or 217 of revenue 

 

interest expense net increased 66 to 770 million for 2006 compared to 722 million for 2005 due to higher average outstanding borrowings and average commercial paper rates

segment results of operations 

 

diversified 

 

 

 

diversified’s revenue and earnings increases were driven by both the industrial equipment group and the process equipment group due to growth in the aerospace defense heat exchanger and oil and gas markets 

 

industrial equipment’s revenue and earnings increased 29 and 19 respectively over the prior year the revenue increase was driven primarily by strength in the aerospace and construction markets the margin decrease resulted from unfavorable product mix and acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by volume increases and moderating raw material pricing the automotive and powersports business was down as gains from the north american professional racing market were not enough to offset a weak powersports market bookings increased 26 and backlog increased 25 

 

process equipment’s fullyear revenue and earnings rose 19 and 33 respectively and margin grew to over 15 reflecting double digit revenue growth in all areas and significant earnings and margin growth in the oil and gas market for bearings in addition overall growth was driven by the expanding hvac markets for heat exchangers as well as productivity gains bookings increased 20 and backlog grew 30 

 

electronics 

 

 

 

the increases in both revenue and earnings at electronics were primarily driven by the acquisition of two significant components companies knowles electronics and colder products in the third quarter of 2005 and 

operating improvements within core businesses although these gains were partially offset by decreases in commercial equipment and purchase accounting amortization

industries 

 

 

 

revenue and earnings increases in industries were driven primarily by the mobile equipment group due to strong military sales and strength in environmental markets industries’ earnings increase was partially offset by a decrease at the service equipment group bookings and backlog both exceeded prioryear levels on improved strength in the environmental and military markets 

 

strong military sales and strength in the oil field industry contributed to mobile equipment revenue and earnings increases of 15 and 41 respectively with significant margin improvement earnings were also positively impacted by a gain of approximately 1 million on the sale of a facility and cost control initiatives bookings increased 14 driven by strong demand for trailer and refuse products and backlog increased 15 

 

service equipment revenue and margin were flat while earnings declined moderately reflecting overall end market conditions and weakness in the automotive service industry earnings were negatively impacted by product mix new product introduction costs and a facility shutdown bookings were essentially flat while backlog increased 18

business strategy 

 

the company operates with certain fundamental strategies first it seeks to acquire and own businesses with proprietary engineered industrial products which make them leaders in the niche markets they serve to ensure success the dover companies place emphasis on new product development to better serve customers and expansion into new markets to serve new customers second these businesses are committed to operational excellence and all of dover’s operating companies are expected to be market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital third the company is committed to an autonomous operating culture with high ethical standards trust respect and open communication to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness 

 

management philosophy 

 

the company practices a highly decentralized management style the presidents of the operating companies are given a great deal of autonomy and have a high level of independent responsibility for their businesses and their performance this is in keeping with the company’s operating philosophy that independent operations are better able to serve customers by focusing closely on their products and markets and reacting quickly to customer needs the company’s executive management role is to provide management oversight allocate and manage capital assist in major acquisitions evaluate motivate and as necessary replace operating company management and also provide selected other services 

 

acquisitions 

 

dover has a longstanding acquisition program which seeks to acquire and develop “platform” businesses that are market leaders as measured by market share customer service innovation profitability and return on invested capital ideal acquisition candidates are generally manufacturers of high valueadded engineered products sold to a broad customer base of industrial or commercial users one of the most critical factors in the decision to acquire a business is the company’s judgment of the skill energy ethics and compatibility of the top executives at the 

  acquisition target keeping with the company’s decentralized structure dover generally expects that acquired companies will continue to be operated by the management team in place at acquisition with a high degree of autonomy 

 

the company has traditionally focused on acquiring new businesses that can operate independently from other dover companies “standalones” beginning in 1993 the company began increasing the number of “addon” businesses it acquired — businesses that could be added on to existing dover companies in recent years including 2005 the company has indicated an intention to buy larger standalones while continuing to acquire “addon” businesses to enhance companies already owned 

 

from january 1 2000 through december 31 2005 the company made 68 acquisitions at a total acquisition cost of 29008 million these acquisitions have had a substantial impact on the company’s revenue and earnings since 2000 during the three years 20012003 the overall number of company acquisitions and dollars invested was lower than in previous years this largely reflected the general economic conditions and the lack of attractive acquisition candidates in 2004 the company acquired eight addon businesses for an aggregate of 5143 million during 2005 the company acquired a total of ten businesses eight addons for an aggregate cost of 10918 million the highest annual acquisition investment level in its history for more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company’s future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of the company’s current businesses operate in relatively mature markets while the company expects all of its businesses to generate annual internal growth of 5 – 7 sustained internal growth at these levels is difficult to achieve 

 

divestitures 

 

in 2006 dover is entering the second year of a strategic review of its portfolio of businesses a process that has improved the company’s focus on key markets for longterm growth while the company generally expects to hold businesses that it buys it periodically reassesses the portfolio of businesses to verify that those businesses continue to be essential contributors to dover’s longterm growth strategy on occasion there are situations in which one of dover’s companies is a very attractive acquisition for another company based on specific market conditions in those circumstances dover might make an opportunistic sale such as the 2005 sale of hydratight sweeney and the agreement to sell tranter phe in addition the company will strategically divest operations that cannot meet dover’s longterm performance goals such as the 2005 sales of somero enterprises and koolant koolers based on these criteria the company has from time to time divested businesses over the past five years the company has discontinued 26 and sold 21 operations for an aggregate pretax consideration of approximately 619 million for more details see the “discontinued operations” discussion below and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

raw materials 

 

dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on operating profits during 2002 steel tariffs were imposed on the importation of certain steel products which had a slight adverse impact on a number of dover operating companies that use large amounts of steel these tariffs remained in effect throughout most of 2003 and were repealed late in the year in 2004 there were meaningful increases in raw material costs particularly steel and higher energy costs including an estimated increase in unrecovered steel costs of 35 million these increases primarily affected the company’s industrial segments in 2005 the impact of commodity prices moderated and most of the operating companies were able to offset cost increases with surcharges and price increases 

 

research and development 

 

dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2005 1922 million was spent on research and development including qualified engineering costs compared with 1814 million and 1515 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

for the technologies and electronics companies efforts in these areas tend to be particularly significant because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high in general the technologies companies that provide electronic assembly equipment and services believe that their customers expect the performance capabilities of such equipment to improve significantly over time with a concurrent lowering of operating costs and increasing efficiency significant new product development and introduction costs were incurred in 20032004 and moderated in 2005 likewise electronics companies developing specialty electronic 

  components for the datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced costs the result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period 

 

dover’s other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the technologies and electronics businesses 

 

intellectual property 

 

dover companies own many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large portion of the dover companies’ intellectual property consists of confidential and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the companies seek to protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate while the dover companies’ intellectual property is important to their success the loss or expiration of any of these rights or any groups of related rights probably would not materially affect the company on a consolidated basis the company believes that its companies’ commitment to continuous engineering improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to their general leadership position in the niche markets that they serve 

 

seasonality 

 

in general operations of the dover companies while not seasonal tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters particularly companies serving the consumer electronics transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets companies serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries tend to have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends 

 

customers 

 

dover’s companies serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated revenue in 2005 one customer within the systems segment accounted for approximately 20 of systems revenue during 2005 within each of the other five segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segment’s revenue in 2005 

 

the components group within the electronics segment serves the military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure markets its customers include some of the largest operators in these markets in addition many of the oem customers of the components group outsource their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services “ems” companies the cat group customers include many of the largest global ems companies particularly some of the newer ems companies in china 

 

in the other dover segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies supplying the automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end use applications 

 

backlog 

 

backlog generally is not a significant factor in most of dover’s businesses as most of the products of dover companies have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to those businesses that produce larger 

  and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the diversified segment as well as the mobile equipment group within the industries segment the cat group within the technologies segment and the components group within the electronics segment total company backlog as of december 31 2005 and 2004 was 12765 million and 9960 million respectively 

 

competition 

 

dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products its companies manufacture and the markets they serve in general most dover companies are market leaders which compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation dover usually is a more significant competitor domestically where its principal markets are than in foreign markets however dover companies are becoming increasingly global where greater competition exists 

 

in the technologies segment dover companies compete globally against a few very large companies primarily operating in japan europe and elsewhere in the far east their primary competitors are japanese and european manufacturers 

 

within the other segments competition is primarily domestic although an increasing number of dover companies see more international competitors and several serve markets which are predominantly international particularly certain companies in the electronics systems resources and diversified segments 

 

international 

 

for foreign revenue including exports and an allocation of the assets of the company’s continuing operations see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign governmental restrictions dover intends to increase its expansion into foreign markets including south america asia and eastern europe 

 

the countries where most of dover’s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are based are france germany the uk the netherlands sweden switzerland and with increased emphasis china 

 

environmental matters 

 

dover believes its operations generally are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued compliance will not have a material impact on the company’s financial position and will not require significant expenditures or adjustments to reserves 

 

employees 

 

the company had approximately 31650 employees in continuing operations as of december 31 2005

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially 

  from recent results or from anticipated future results for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated see the discussion in “special notes regarding forwardlooking statements” included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

cyclical economic conditions may affect our financial performance 

 

a meaningful portion of the company’s revenue most notably from the circuit assembly and test group in the technologies segment is derived from companies in capital goods markets that are subject to inherently unpredictable business cycles as a result the revenue and operating performance of these companies in any one period are not necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating performance in other periods and could have a material impact on dover’s consolidated financial position 

 

in addition dover is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other usbased industrial manufacturers however except as noted above the structure of dover and the many different markets its companies serve mitigate the possibility that any of these risk factors will materially impact dover’s consolidated financial position

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among “potentially responsible parties” in each instance the extent of the company’s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other “potentially responsible parties” involved and is anticipated to be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been established 

 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of products of dover companies exposure to hazardous substances or patent infringement litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves in the opinion of management based on these reviews it is very unlikely that the disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position

liquidity and capital resources 

 

management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

 

the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities during 2005 increased 821 million or 14 compared to 2004 which included a tax refund of approximately 41 million the increase in cash flows provided by operations reflected higher net earnings and incremental decreases in working capital which was partially offset by an 180 million pension contribution higher benefits and compensation payouts and an increase in tax payments of approximately 83 million in 2005 

 

cash used in investing activities during 2005 increased 5475 million compared to 2004 reflecting an increase in acquisition and capital expenditure activity partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of businesses and sale of property and equipment acquisition expenditures in 2005 were 10918 million compared to 5061 million in 2004 capital expenditures in 2005 increased 496 million to 1521 million as compared to 1025 million in 2004 primarily due to investments in plant expansions plant machinery and information systems proceeds from the disposition of businesses increased 854 million to 1593 million the company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions made during 2006 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and if necessary through the issuance of commercial paper established lines of credit or public debt markets capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to increase moderately over 2005 levels 

 

cash provided by financing activities during 2005 totaled 2728 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of 1010 million during 2004 the net change in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a net increase in borrowings of 4395 million that were used to fund current year acquisitions partially offset by cash used in the repurchase of treasury shares 519 million and dividends paid of 1339 million 

 

adjusted working capital a nongaap measure calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased from december 31 2004 by 164 million or 13 to 12921 million primarily driven by increases in receivables of 1271 million increases in payables of 569 million offset by decreases in inventory of 538 million excluding the impact of acquisitions on working capital of 807 million and changes in 

  foreign currency of 493 million working capital decreased by 150 million or 3 from december 31 2004 the increase in receivables was driven by increased revenue activity and acquisitions of 540 million partially offset by decreases due to foreign currency fluctuations of 489 million the inventory balance decrease was driven by operations and decreases due to foreign currency fluctuations of 238 million partially offset by acquisitions of 595 million increases in accounts payable were a result of a concerted effort by management to better align the payable cycle with the company’s cash receipts cycle acquisitions of 328 million partially offset by a decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations of 234 million 

 

in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flow the company also measures free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions pay dividends repay debt and repurchase dover’s common stock for further information see nongaap disclosures at the end of this item 7 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2005 was 5075 million or 83 of revenue compared to 4750 million or 91 of revenue in the prior year period which included a tax refund of approximately 41 million in the first quarter of 2004 the 2005 increase in free cash flow reflected higher net earnings and incremental decreases in working capital which was partially offset by pension contributions of 180 million to the knowles electronics holdings inc pension plan higher benefits and compensation payouts and increased capital expenditures of 496 million and tax payments of approximately 83 million the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities 

 

 

 

at december 31 2005 the company’s net property plant and equipment totaled 8167 million compared to 7270 million at the end of 2004 the increase in net property plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of 1003 million capital expenditures of 1521 million partially offset by decreases related to foreign currency fluctuation of 227 million and depreciation 

 

the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities increased from a 4259 million net liability at the beginning of the year to 4282 million at yearend 2005 this resulted primarily from decreases in current tax liabilities increases in deferred tax assets from accruals and net operating loss carryforwards primarily acquisition related partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets 

 

dover’s consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by 1607 million in 2005 the increase was due principally to acquisitions of 962 million and actuarial losses related to lower discount rate assumptions offsetting this plan assets increased 1110 million due to acquisitions of 685 million gains on plan investments during the year and company contributions of 180 million which were partially offset by the payouts of benefits during 2005 plan amendments created an increase in the benefit obligation of 97 million due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses it is estimated that pension expense will increase from 267 million to approximately 41 million in 2006 the company anticipates discretionary contributions to its pension benefit plans of under 25 million in 2006 

  the company utilizes the total debt and net debt to total capitalization calculations a nongaap measure to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculations are useful to its stockholders for the same reasons the following table provides a reconciliation of total debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

 

 

the total debt level of 15384 million as of december 31 2005 increased 4461 million from december 31 2004 as a result of an increase in borrowings to fund acquisitions made in 2005 on october 26 2005 the company closed a 1 billion 5year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that replaces the company’s 400 million 364day facility and its 5year 600 million facility this facility is primarily used to support the company’s commercial paper borrowings and had no outstanding balance at december 31 2005 in addition on october 13 2005 dover issued 300 million of 4875 notes due 2015 and 300 million of 5375 debentures due 2035 the net proceeds from the notes and debentures were used to fund acquisitions the notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of dover in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that includes a makewhole premium with accrued interest to the redemption date 

 

also on november 25 2005 the company entered into a 3 year € 75 million credit facility this facility had no outstanding balance as of december 31 2005 

 

dover’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 13454 million on december 31 2005 and a fair value of approximately 14060 million on december 31 2004 the company’s longterm debt instruments had a book value of 10057 million and a fair value of approximately 10930 million 

 

the company was in compliance with the covenants related to its debt as of december 31 2005 and 2004 

 

the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the foreseeable future acquisition spending may increase company debt however management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company’s various cash flow requirements including for acquisition spending and capital expenditures 

 

management is not aware of any potential impairment to the company’s liquidity and the company is in compliance with all of its longterm debt covenants it is anticipated that in 2006 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or depending upon market conditions through the issuance of longterm debt or some combination of the two 

 

during the third quarter 2005 dover entered into several treasury rate locks related to the october 13 2005 notes and debentures the contracts were settled on october 13 2005 and the resulting gain of 30 million is being deferred and amortized over the life of the related notes and debentures 

 

as of december 31 2005 the company had two interest rate swaps outstanding for a total notional amount of 1000 million designated as fair value hedges of the 1500 million 625 notes due on june 1 2008 one 50 million interest rate swap exchanged fixedrate interest for variablerate interest the other 50 million swap is 

  designated in foreign currency and exchanges fixedrate interest for variablerate interest and also hedges a portion of the company’s net investment in foreign operations the swap agreements reduced the effective interest rate on the notes to 512 there was no hedge ineffectiveness as of december 31 2005 and the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps of 09 million was determined through market quotation and is reported in other assets and longterm debt 

 

during 2005 the company entered into derivative contracts to hedge potential foreign currency volatility on current assets and liabilities the contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were considered by management to be highly effective the derivative foreign exchange contracts settled during 2005 and resulted in a gain of approximately 06 million which is recognized in other income expense net 

 

at december 31 2005 the company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through december 2006 related to hedges of foreign currency exposures as follows 

 

 

 

the company’s credit ratings which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies are as follows for the years ended december 31

consolidated results of operations

  revenue would have increased 16 to 60661 million if 2004 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2005 results acquisitions completed during 2005 contributed 2093 million to revenue and contributed operating profit before purchase accounting writeoffs of 326 million gross profit of 20794 million in 2005 represented a 16 increase compared to 17937 million in 2004 while gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 342 and 344 respectively

net interest expense increased 178 to 722 million for 2005 compared to 613 million for 2004 the primary reason for the increase in net interest expense was higher outstanding borrowings used to fund 2005 acquisitions 

 

other income expense net for 2005 of 153 million was driven primarily by foreign exchange gains other income expense net of 16 million for 2004 included gains on dispositions favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of 95 million which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of 79 million 

 

the 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 263 compared to 254 in 2004 and includes a 95 million us tax provision related to the repatriation of 3737 million of dividends a 255 million benefit primarily related to the resolution of us tax issues and a 55 million first quarter benefit related to a favorable federal tax court decision excluding the repatriation provision the full year 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 248 dover expects the 2006 effective tax rate to be between 28 and 30 for continuing operations

segment results of operations 

diversified 

 

 

 

diversified’s revenue and earnings increases were driven by both the industrial equipment group and the process equipment group due to growth in the aerospace defense heat exchanger and oil and gas markets 

 

industrial equipment’s revenue and earnings increased 27 and 17 respectively over the prior year the revenue increase was driven primarily by strength in the aerospace and construction markets the margin decrease resulted from unfavorable product mix and acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by volume increases and moderating raw material pricing the automotive and powersports business was down as gains from the north 

  american professional racing market were not enough to offset a weak powersports market bookings increased 23 generating a booktobill ratio of 108 and backlog increased 22 

 

process equipment fullyear revenue and earnings rose 19 and 33 respectively and margin grew to over 15 reflecting double digit revenue growth in all areas and significant earnings and margin growth in the oil and gas market for bearings in addition overall growth was driven by the expanding hvac markets for heat exchangers as well as productivity gains bookings increased 20 backlog grew 30 and the booktobill ratio was 108 

electronics 

 

 

 

the increase in both revenue and earnings at electronics was primarily driven by the acquisition of two significant components companies knowles electronics and colder products in the third quarter of 2005 and operating improvements within core businesses although these gains were partially offset by decreases in commercial equipment and purchase accounting amortization 

 

components operating earnings increased 128 in 2005 compared to the prior year on a 46 increase in revenue reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and revenue and earnings growth in almost all of the other components businesses the margin grew to exceed 11 and was aided by the two recent acquisitions and included 53 million of integration costs related to a 2004 vectron acquisition which has essentially been completed bookings increased 57 backlog grew 81 and the booktobill ratio was 107 

 

commercial equipment full year revenue was flat with earnings down 23 and a substantial decrease in margin reflecting some market softness and the effect of hurricane katrina which disrupted the atm operations significantly in the third quarter of 2005 bookings decreased 2 backlog grew 23 and the booktobill ratio was 101 

industries 

 

 

 

revenue and earnings increases in industries were driven primarily by the mobile equipment group due to strong military sales and strength in environmental markets industries earnings increase was partially offset by a decrease at the service equipment group bookings and backlog both exceeded prioryear levels on improved strength in the environmental and military markets 

 

strong military sales and strength in the oil field industry contributed to mobile equipment revenue and earnings increases of 15 and 45 respectively with significant margin improvement earnings were also positively impacted by a gain of approximately 1 million on the sale of a facility and cost control initiatives bookings increased 14 driven by strong demand for trailer and refuse products generating a booktobill ratio of 105 and a backlog increase of 15 

  service equipment revenue and margin were flat while earnings declined moderately reflecting overall end market conditions and weakness in the automotive service industry earnings were negatively impacted by product mix new product introduction costs and a facility shutdown bookings were essentially flat backlog increased 18 and the booktobill ratio was 101 

resources

2004 compared with 2003 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

revenue for 2004 of 52171 million was up 10509 million or 25 from 2003 primarily driven by increases of 3673 million at technologies and 3503 million at resources technologies’ revenue was impacted by positive trends in the global electronics industry particularly in the backend semiconductor market as well as expansion of the chinese manufacturing capacity resources’ revenue increased due to improved market conditions and the full year impact of the 2003 acquisition of warn industries 

 

revenue would have increased 22 to 50971 million if 2003 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2004 results acquisitions completed during 2004 contributed 1041 million to revenue and contributed gross profit of 386 million gross profit of 17937 million in 2004 represented a 26 increase compared to 14263 million in 2003 the gross profit margin was essentially flat for both 2004 and 2003 at 344 and 342 as volume increases in 2004 were offset by rising commodity prices 

 

selling and administrative expenses for 2004 were 12053 million or 231 of revenue compared to 10032 million or 241 of revenue in 2003 the increase in selling and administrative expenses included the costs related to sarbanesoxley requirements and increases in compensation and pension benefits operating earnings of 5883 million for 2004 increased 1653 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 25 increase in revenue benefits from the company’s restructuring programs undertaken during 2002 and 2001 and slightly improved global economic conditions operating margin for 2004 was 113 compared to 102 for 2003 

 

net interest expense decreased 2 to 613 million for 2004 compared to 623 million for 2003 the primary reason for the decrease in net interest expense was income related to the company’s outstanding interest rate swaps related to a portion of its longterm debt 

 

other income expense net for 2004 was 16 million and includes gains on dispositions favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of 95 million which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of 79 million other income expense net of 97 million for 2003 primarily related to foreign exchange losses of 

  62 million the foreign exchange losses in both 2004 and 2003 primarily relate to the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 

 

dover’s effective 2004 tax rate for continuing operations was 254 compared to the 2003 rate of 230 the low effective tax rate for both years is largely due to the continuing benefit from tax credit programs such as those for research and experimentation combined with the benefit from us export programs lower effective foreign tax rates from the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and the recognition of certain capital loss benefits which were higher in 2003 

 

earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were 3942 million or 192 per diluted share compared to 2701 million or 133 per diluted share from continuing operations in 2003 for 2004 net earnings were 4128 million or 202 per diluted share including 186 million or 009 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations compared to 2929 million or 144 per diluted share for 2003 which included 228 million or 011 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations refer to note 7 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

 

segment results of operations 

diversified 

 

 

 

diversified revenue and earnings increases were driven by both the industrial equipment group and the process equipment group 

 

industrial equipment revenue and earnings increased 23 and 34 respectively primarily due to the continued recovery of the commercial and defense aerospace markets increased cab sales volumes with key customers in the constructionagriculture equipment markets and the recovery of the automotive racing and powersports markets solid execution of performance improvement plans as well as the addition of new customers and improved operating efficiencies all contributed to the earnings and margin increases bookings increased 32 generating a booktobill ratio of 112 and backlog increased 33 

 

process equipment revenue increased 15 while earnings increased 21 primarily due to the addition of new key customers for its color and ink control products moving its customer base from small and medium size printers in the aftermarket to large printers and the highend new press oem market in the heat pump and boiler markets order activity was steady throughout the year and production capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity programs to meet the growing demand cost reduction activities and favorable currency rates also contributed to the earnings and margin increases bookings increased 23 generating a booktobill ratio of 107 and backlog increased 33 

  electronics 

 

 

electronics revenue and earnings growth in 2004 was primarily due to increases in the atm business and the impact of acquisitions on the components group 

 

components revenue and earnings increases of 30 and 61 respectively were primarily due to acquisitions made at the end of 2003 and during 2004 as well as stronger demand from communication equipment customers which peaked in the second quarter of 2004 bookings increased 27 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 100 and backlog increased 30

industries 

 

 

industries revenue and earnings increases reflected continued market share gains helped by considerable new product introductions in the mobile equipment group which was the largest contributor to the revenue and earnings increases 

 

mobile equipment revenue and earnings were up 23 and 42 respectively over the prior year due to an increase in buying in municipal markets increases in market share within the national account segment and further penetration into the independent hauler segment recycling products had a strong year as baler sales increased behind new product introductions and product redesigns the mobile equipment group increased its market share due in part to a large onetime order from a national account by leveraging its broad product line and by focusing engineering efforts on identifying customer needs bookings increased 10 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 106 and backlog increased 21 

 

service equipment revenue increased 15 while earnings increased 7 much of the increase in revenue was due to new lower margin product categories introduced in the latter half of 2003 earnings were also hampered by escalating steel costs and pricing pressures from lowcost asian car wash imports sales to major oil companies were up for the year but investor sales were flat as hurricanes and heavy rain reduced nearterm car wash volume and therefore made current investors reconsider their replacement and expansion plans for the year bookings increased 14 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 101 and backlog increased 19 

  resources

fluid solutions 2004 revenue and earnings increased 14 and 30 respectively when compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in retail service station construction and remodeling the opening of a new manufacturing facility in china an expanded presence in brazil and stronger growth in the rail tank car market the group’s earnings benefited from restructuring and consolidation initiatives in 2003 generating strong earnings leverage as a result of these initiatives bookings increased 15 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 103 and backlog increased 37 

 

material handling revenue and earnings increased 79 and 113 respectively which includes the results of warn industries which was acquired in october 2003 the group achieved record revenue in power sports products strong growth in its branded truck products and continued growth in powertrain products driven by increased demand for light trucks and sport utility vehicles also strong growth was achieved in robotics tooling and through major industrial catalog sales these strengths were dampened by slow growth in the automotive tooling and work holding markets the petroleum military construction equipment and mobile crane markets rebounded in early 2004 and provided increased opportunities for growth and the business has been able to realize synergy in sales and engineering from prior acquisitions orders finished strong with a bookings increase of 89 resulting in a booktobill ratio of 106 and backlog increased 61 

 

systems 

 

 

systems 2004 revenue was flat while 2004 earnings decreased by 14 primarily due to weakness in the food equipment group which experienced slower market conditions and a rise in commodity costs 

 

food equipment revenue was essentially flat while earnings decreased 18 continued weakness in municipal spending negatively impacted the institutional equipment market for the third consecutive year 2004 saw numerous chain restaurant newstore openings being delayed or put on hold despite slower overall market conditions and consolidations in the supermarket industry revenue continued to grow through expansion of its customer base by 

  offering industryleading product innovations and strong customer service in addition the group was heavily impacted by the rise in commodity costs and a slowdown in new construction and remodels by two of its major customers bookings increased 11 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 106 and backlog increased 37 

 

packaging equipment revenue increased 4 while earnings were essentially flat despite weakness in the german market and the result of a consolidating retail environment international sales were strong driven by strength in eastern europe primarily russia poland romania hungary and the baltic states the us business moderately increased amid continued pricing pressures earnings were negatively impacted by investments in product development startup costs associated with opening a new facility in the czech republic and increases in commodity costs bookings increased 15 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 105 and backlog increased 48 

 

technologies 

 

 

technologies revenue and earnings increases were due primarily to the continued recovery of the overall electronics industry which commenced in 2003 particularly strong was the midyear activity in the backend semiconductor markets however by the fourth quarter the semiconductor and related markets had slowed significantly as did the level of chinese contract manufacturers’ capital expenditures 

 

cat experienced 42 revenue growth and 159 earnings growth in 2004 compared to 2003 most of this growth came from the companies serving the backend semiconductor markets and from new technology requirements in solder paste management and soldering in addition the group acquired a test handling company rasco gmbh in june 2004 which contributed to the overall growth in revenue and earnings revenue was also positively impacted by increased sales of circuit assembly feeders and strong market acceptance of selective soldering machines and product breadth that addresses the specific needs of the north american european and asian markets the memory chip attach and special application segments also contributed to the revenue and earnings growth bookings increased 33 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 098 and backlog increased 3 

 

pip reported a 17 increase in revenue and a 15 increase in earnings primarily due to its cij applications in primary packaging and dod and ttol applications in secondary packaging and large character printing cij unit volume for the year was at a record level although noncij products were becoming an increasing percentage of the group’s business in addition during december the group completed the acquisition of datamax international a floridabased manufacturer of bar code printers which was immaterial to the revenue and earnings of the group in 2004 due to the timing of the acquisition in addition the group experienced significant growth in label press orders driven by the strength of the euro us tax incentives and improvements in sales strategies bookings increased 18 over the 2003 period resulting in a booktobill ratio of 101 and backlog increased 36

foreign exchange 

 

the company conducts business in various foreign countries primarily in canada europe brazil china and other asian countries therefore changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the company’s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations as of december 31 2005 the company had not established a formal companywide foreigncurrency hedging program but may from time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges certain individual operating companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value andor cash flow hedging the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are localcurrency based a change of 10 or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company’s financial position and cash flows

diversified industrial manufacturing corporation encompassing 49 operating
companies that primarily manufacture a broad range of specialized industrial
products and sophisticated manufacturing equipment and seek to expand their
range of related services additional information is contained in items 7 and 8

     the companys businesses have been divided into four business segments

food refrigeration and display cases specialized bearings construction and
agricultural cabs as well as sophisticated products for use in the defense
aerospace and automotive industries industries makes products for use in the
waste handling bulk transport automotive service commercial food service and
packaging welding cash dispenser and construction industries resources
manufactures products primarily for the automotive fluid handling petroleum
original equipment manufacturers oem engineered components and chemical
equipment industries technologies builds sophisticated automated assembly and
testing equipment and specialized electronic components for the electronics
industry and industrial printers for coding and marking

     effective january 1 2005 the company organized its 49 operating companies
into 13 groups within six segments adding the electronics and systems
subsidiaries beginning with the first quarter 2005 earnings announcement in
april 2005 the company will report its results in these six business segments
and discuss its operating companies in 13 groups management believes this new
operating structure will enhance the companys market focus acquisition
capacity and executive leadership

business strategy

     the company operates with certain fundamental objectives first it seeks
to acquire and own businesses with proprietary engineered industrial products
which make them leaders in the niche markets which they serve second these
businesses should be customer focused innovative and well managed to achieve
above average profit margins by supplying customers with valueadded products
and related services third the company expects that these types of businesses
will generate strong cash flow which can not only sustain such operations but
also provide excess cash flow which the company can then reinvest in similar
business opportunities

     the company expects to manage its cash flow so that the mix of its external
debt levels and capital structure are optimized to support continued ready
access to the capital markets

management philosophy

     the company practices a highly decentralized management style the
presidents of the operating companies are given a great deal of autonomy and
have a high level of independent responsibility for their businesses and their
performance this is in keeping with the companys operating philosophy that
independent operations are better able to serve customers by focusing closely on
their products and reacting quickly to customer needs the companys executive
management role is to provide management oversight allocate and manage capital
assist in major acquisitions evaluate motivate and as necessary replace
operating company management and provide selected other services

acquisitions and divestitures

     the company has a longstanding acquisition program the company seeks to
acquire and develop platform businesses which are marked by growth
innovation and higher than average profit margins each of its businesses should
be a leader in its market as measured by market share customer service
innovation profitability and return on assets the company traditionally
focused on acquiring new businesses that could
                                        2

operate independently from other dover companies standalones since 1993
an increased emphasis has been placed on acquiring businesses that can be added
on to existing operations addons the target companies are generally
manufacturers of high valueadded engineered products sold to a broad customer
base of industrial or commercial users one of the most critical factors in the
decision to acquire a business is the companys judgment of the skill energy
ethics and compatibility of the top executives at the acquisition target dover
generally expects that acquired companies will continue to be operated by the
management team in place at acquisition with a high degree of autonomy in
keeping with the companys decentralized structure from january 1 2000 through
december 31 2004 the company made 58 acquisitions at a total acquisition cost
of 18090 million these acquisitions have had a substantial impact on the
companys sales and earnings since 2000 during the three years 20012003 the
overall number of company acquisitions and dollars invested was lower than in
previous years this largely reflected the general economic conditions and the
lack of attractive acquisition candidates in 2004 the company acquired eight
addon businesses for an aggregate of 5143 million its highest acquisition
spending level since 1999 for more details regarding acquisitions completed
over the past two years see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in
item 8 the companys future growth depends in large part on finding and
acquiring successful businesses as a substantial number of the companys
current businesses operate in relatively mature markets where sustained internal
growth objectives are difficult to achieve

     while the company generally expects to buy and hold businesses it does
periodically reassess each business to verify that it continues to represent a
good longterm investment there may also be situations where a company business
represents a very attractive acquisition for another company based on specific
market conditions based on these criteria the company has divested businesses
over the past three years the company has been more proactive in evaluating its
operating companies against internal growth and profitability criteria during
that time the company has discontinued 13 and sold 15 operations for an
aggregate consideration of 999 million for more details see the
discontinued operations discussion below and note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements in item 8

     during 2002 the company discontinued seven businesses four in the
technologies segment and three in the resources segment in 2002 two of these
businesses one from each of technologies and resources were
                                        10

sold for a net after tax loss of 45 million the five remaining businesses
were classified as held for sale as of december 31 2002 in 2003 all five
businesses were disposed of or liquidated for a net after tax gain of 49
million

     charges to reduce these discontinued businesses to their estimated fair
values have been recorded in earnings losses from discontinued operations net
of tax for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 pretax charges were
recorded to writeoff goodwill of 173 million and 316 million respectively
and other longlived asset impairments and other charges were recorded of 02
million and 123 million respectively no charges related to the writeoff of
goodwill or other longlived asset impairments were recorded in 2004

     also during 2003 in connection with the completion of a federal income tax
audit and commercial resolution of other issues the company adjusted certain
reserves established in connection with the sales of previously discontinued
operations and recorded a gain on the sales of discontinued operations net of
tax of 166 million and additional tax benefits of 51 million related to
losses previously incurred on sales of business these amounts were offset by
charges of 136 million net of tax to reduce discontinued businesses to their
estimated fair value and a loss on the sale of discontinued operations net of
tax of 60 million related to contingent liabilities from previously
discontinued operations total losses from discontinued operations in 2002
primarily relate to charges to reduce discontinued businesses to their estimated
fair value

raw materials

     dovers operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily
metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available
from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single
supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on
operating profits during 2002 steel tariffs were imposed on the importation of
certain steel products which had a slight adverse impact on a number of dover
operating companies that use large amounts of steel these tariffs remained in
effect throughout most of 2003 and were repealed late in the year in 2004
there were meaningful increases in raw material costs particularly steel and
higher energy costs including an estimated increase in unrecovered steel costs
of 35 million these increases primarily affected all three of the companys
industrial segments although steel prices are expected to remain relatively
high during 2005 and will continue to have an impact on a number of dover
operating companies the company expects that the overall raw material cost
impact will be less in 2005 than it was in 2004

research and development

     dovers operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well
as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand
sales opportunities maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product
reliability and reduce production costs during 2004 approximately 1883
million was spent on research and development compared with 1587 million and
1662 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively

     for the technologies companies efforts in these areas tend to be
particularly significant because the rate of product development by their
customers is often quite high in general the technologies companies that
provide electronic assembly equipment and services can anticipate that the
performance capabilities of such equipment are expected to improve significantly
over time with a concurrent expectation of lower operating costs and increasing
efficiency significant new product development and introduction costs were
realized in 20032004 which are expected to moderate in 2005 likewise
technologies companies developing specialty electronic components for the
datacom and telecom commercial markets anticipate a continuing rate of product
performance improvement and reduced cost such that product life cycles
generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions
over that time period

     the industries resources and diversified segments contain many businesses
that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these
businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific
applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously
improving manufacturing processes only a few of these businesses experience the
same rate of change in their markets and products that is experienced generally
by the technologies businesses

intellectual property

     the company owns many patents trademarks licenses and other forms of
intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to
the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large
portion of the companys intellectual property consists of confidential and
proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the company seeks to
protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and
suppliers where appropriate while the companys intellectual property is
important to its success the loss or expiration of any significant portion of
these rights probably would not materially affect the company or any of its
segments the company believes that its commitment to continuous engineering
improvements new product development and improved manufacturing techniques as
well as strong sales marketing and service efforts are significant to its
general leadership position in the niche markets that it serves

seasonality

     in general dovers operations while not seasonal tend to have stronger
revenues in the second and third quarters in particular those companies
serving the transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial
refrigeration and food service markets tend to be strong during the second and
third quarters companies serving the major equipment markets such as power
generation chemical and processing industries tend to have long lead times
geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands which tend to delay or
accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends

customers

     dovers businesses serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted
for more than 10 of the companys consolidated revenues in 2004 within each of
the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segments
sales in 2004

     the technologies specialty electronic component sec group addresses the
military space aerospace commercial and datacomtelecom infrastructure
markets their customers include some of the largest customers in these markets
including raytheon military and lucent cisco and huawei datacomtelecom in
addition many of the oem customers of the sec group outsource their
manufacturing to electronic manufacturing services ems companies the
technologies circuit board assembly and test group customers also include many
of the largest global ems companies including jabil solectron celestica and
flextronics and the newer emerging ems companies in china such as foxconn
asustek inventec and wistron

     in the other dover segments customer concentrations are quite varied
companies supplying the automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend
to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries
this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation
aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually
a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies
provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad
range of end use applications

backlog

     backlog generally is not a significant factor in most of dovers
businesses as most of dovers products have relatively short ordertodelivery
periods it is more relevant to those businesses in the segments which produce
larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts
primarily in the diversified segment as well as the heil companies from the
industries segment and the cbat and sec companies from the technologies segment
total company backlog as of december 31 2004 and 2003 was 10574 million and
8229 million respectively

competition

     dovers competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of
the products it manufactures and the markets it serves in general most dover
companies are market leaders which compete with only a few companies and the key
competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation in
addition since most of dovers manufacturing operations are in the united
states dover usually is a more significant competitor domestically than in
foreign markets

     in the technologies segment dover competes globally against a few very
large companies primarily operating in japan europe and the far east its
primary competitors are japanese producers including fuji machine panasonic
and tdk and european manufacturers like philips and siemens

     within the other segments competition is primarily domestic although an
increasing number of dover companies see more international competitors and
several serve markets which are predominantly international particularly
belvac quartzdyne rpa process technologies tipper tie tranter and waukesha

international

     for foreign sales export sales and an allocation of the assets of the
companys continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements in item no 8 of this form 10k

     although international operations are subject to certain risks such as
price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign governmental restrictions
dover intends to increase its expansion into foreign markets including south
america asia and eastern europe

     the countries where most of dovers foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are
based are france germany the uk the netherlands sweden switzerland and
with increased emphasis china

environmental matters

     dover believes its operations generally are in substantial compliance with
applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses
have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental
agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of
regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with
specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued
compliance will not have any material impact on the companys financial position
going forward and will not require significant capital expenditures

employees

     the company had approximately 28100 employees as of december 31 2004

     the facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for the
operations conducted in 2005 the company expects to make modest increases in
capacity for a few businesses experiencing strong growth demands



item 3  legal proceedings

     a few of the companys subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings
relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and
state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among potentially
responsible parties in each instance the extent of the companys liability
appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the
number of other potentially responsible parties involved and is anticipated to
be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the companys subsidiaries
are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in
cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been
established

     the company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of
other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses these proceedings
primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use
of the companys products exposure to hazardous substances or patent
infringement litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment
matters and commercial disputes management and legal counsel periodically
review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of insurance
coverage and established reserves while it is not possible at this time to
predict the outcome of these legal actions or any need for additional reserves
in the opinion of management based on these reviews it is remote that the
disposition of the lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a
material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of
operations cash flows or competitive position



item 4  submission of matters to a vote of security holders

     no matter was submitted to a vote of the companys security holders in the
last quarter of 2004

         of operation

2004 compared with 2003

  summary

     sales for 2004 of 54881 million were up 10748 million or 24 from
2003 primarily driven by increases of 3969 million at technologies and 3546
million at resources technologies sales were impacted by positive trends in
the global electronics industry particularly in the backend semiconductor
market as well as expansion of the chinese manufacturing capacity resources
sales increased due to improved market conditions and the full year impact of
the 2003 acquisition of warn industries industries sales increased 1812
million and diversifieds sales increased by 1426 million sales would have
increased 209 to 53369 million if 2003 foreign currency translation rates
were applied to 2004 results acquisitions completed during 2004 contributed
1041 million to sales and contributed gross profit of 386 million gross
profit of 18944 million in 2004 represented a 25 increase compared to
15204 million in 2003 gross profit margins for both 2004 and 2003 were 345
as volume increases in the current year were offset by rising commodity prices

     selling and administrative expenses for 2004 were 12822 million or 23
of net sales compared to 10767 million or 24 of net sales in 2003 the
increase in selling and administration expenses includes the costs related to
sarbanesoxley requirements and increases in compensation and pension benefits
operating profit of 6122 million for 2004 increased 1684 million compared to
the prior year due primarily to the 24 increase in revenues benefits from the
companys restructuring programs undertaken during 2002 and 2001 and slightly
improved global economic conditions operating profit margin for 2004 was 112
compared to 101 for 2003

     net interest expense decreased 1 to 613 million for 2004 compared to
622 million for 2003 the primary reason for the decrease in net interest
expense was income related to the companys outstanding interest rate swaps
related to a portion of its longterm debt

     other net income for 2004 was 12 million and includes gains on
dispositions favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of 99 million
which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of 87 million other
expenses of 97 million for 2003 primarily related to foreign exchange losses
of 62 million the foreign exchange losses in both 2004 and 2003 primarily
relate to appreciation of the euro against the us dollar

     dovers effective 2004 tax rate for continuing operations was 259
compared to the 2003 rate of 233 the low effective tax rate for both years is
largely due to the continuing benefit from tax credit programs such as those for
re combined with the benefit from us export programs lower effective foreign
tax rates from the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and the
recognition of certain capital loss benefits which were higher in 2003

     net earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were 4091 million or
200 per diluted share compared to 2852 million or 140 per diluted share
from continuing operations in 2003 for 2004 net earnings before cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle were 4128 million or 202 per
diluted share including 36 million or 02 per diluted share in earnings from
discontinued operations compared to 2929 million or 144 per diluted share
for 2003 which included 77 million or 04 per diluted share in earnings from
discontinued operations

     discontinued operations earnings for 2004 were 36 million compared to
earnings of 77 million in 2003 during 2003 in connection with the completion
of a federal income tax audit and commercial resolution of other issues the
company adjusted certain reserves established in connection with the sales of
previously discontinued operations and recorded a gain on the sales of
discontinued operations net of tax of 166 million and additional tax benefits
of 51 million related to losses previously incurred on sales of business
these amounts were offset by charges of 136 million net of tax to reduce
discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value and a loss on the sale of
discontinued operations net of tax of 60 million related to contingent
liabilities from previously discontinued operations total losses from
discontinued operations in

estimated fair value please refer to note 7 in the consolidated financial
statements in item 8

     diversifieds earnings increased 14 on a 12 sales increase as capital
equipment markets improved throughout the year the earnings increase was
achieved mainly through higher sales volumes new products and successful
marketing programs most of the companies especially swep tranter phe and hill
phoenix were negatively affected by significantly increased raw material
prices crenlo mark andy graphics microsystems and hydratight sweeney
accounted for most of the earnings gain which was somewhat offset by declines
at swf and belvac segment bookings improved 22 over prior year and
diversified enters 2005 with a record yearend backlog

     hill phoenix reported record sales and bookings and earnings were the
second best ever at 3 below last years record despite slower overall market
conditions and consolidations in the supermarket industry hill phoenix
continues to grow sales through expansion of its customer base by offering
industryleading product innovations and strong customer service earnings at
refrigeration systems and national cooler both exceeded last year these
increases were offset by lower earnings at display cases which was heavily
impacted by the unprecedented rise in commodity costs and a slow down in new
construction and remodels by two of its major customers margins were down
slightly as the rise in material prices outpaced the businesses ability to
increase prices or fully offset them with costreduction initiatives revenue
growth is expected to continue in 2005 as hill phoenix finished the year with
its highest backlog in three years

     sargent reported record sales fueled by the continued recovery of the
commercial and defense aerospace markets earnings improved 10 however margins
were negatively impacted by startup investments in a facility in mexico and
increased operational support for sargent canadas 89 volume increase raw
material availability and increasing cost remained a challenge at all business
units especially at sonic record bookings improved 23 over prior year led by
the marine division being awarded a large us military order for a submarine
ship set

     performance motorsports produced excellent operating leverage as earnings
increased 15 on a 4 sales increase their performance was driven by the
recovery of the automotive racing and powersports markets the addition of new
customers and improved operating efficiency earnings records were set at three
of their business units je pistons prox and carrillo je pistons and carrillo
achieved market share gains with a number of nascar racing teams while prox
benefited from new products and improved distribution wisecos margins declined
as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the shift from
2cycle to 4cycle pistons performance motorsports exceeded prior year sales
earnings and margins in every quarter of 2004

     swep achieved record bookings sales and earnings while margins decreased
slightly due to significant material cost increases order activity was steady
throughout the year in both its heat pump and boiler markets and production
capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity programs
to meet the growing demand earnings were up 12 driven by volume increases
cost reduction and favorable currency rates due to brisk sales in asia the
plant in malaysia increased production volume by almost 100 for the year

     tranter phe set new bookings and sales records in 2004 though earnings
dropped below last year by 2 earnings benefited from the higher sales volume
but were more than offset by significantly increased stainless steel and
titanium prices and costs associated with the implementation of a new business
system prior investment made in its lowcost facility in india produced
increased capacity and allowed it to double output in 2004 margins improved
significantly in the fourth quarter due to an improved sales mix better
pricing and a reduced workforce tranter phe has had success in selling to new
markets such as ethanol plants in the us and processing plants in brazil

     belvac finished the year with flat sales compared to 2003 earnings were
down 16 due to investments in product development startup costs associated
with opening a new facility in the czech republic and increases in commodity
costs bookings especially in the second half were very strong and increased
by 41 for the full year the increase in bookings is related to a growing
requirement for can size diversity conversions in can top sizes and growth in
the european market a significant portion of its business includes spares and
retrofits that improve productivity of its customers equipment backlog at
yearend was at its highest point in seven years and was 72 higher than the
prior year

     crenlo achieved record bookings and sales due to increased cab volumes
with key customers in the constructionagriculture equipment market in addition
to the higher volume its earnings and margins increased significantly as a
result of solid execution of its performance improvement plan although steel
costs continued to be a significant issue it was able to pass through the
majority of the price increase to its customers its specialty enclosure
business reported flat sales and earnings for the year crenlos backlog
increased each quarter and ended the year at 49 above 2003

     mark andys results were much improved over prior year as it achieved
record sales and bookings and more than doubled earnings significant growth in
label press orders were driven by the strength of the euro us tax incentives
and improvements in sales strategies a number of new product introductions in
both the mark andy and comco product lines have enhanced its technology
leadership position in the industry growth was seen in both the domestic and
international markets and indications are that it has taken market share from
competitors

     hydratight sweeney had a record year as earnings grew 57 on a sales gain
of 23 its tension and service business drove the performance with strong sales
to the robust oil and gas markets especially in the north sea and the middle
east both its morgrip and hevilift product lines made strong contributions to
its results in 2004 the torque business units results were down to prior year
due to low hydraulic sales partially offset by increased industrial and aero
sales especially to military customers

     waukesha bearings reported slightly lower earnings on flat sales as the
power generation market is experiencing a slow recovery however its oil and
gas markets continue to be buoyant and are expected to remain strong in 2005
the decline in earnings is primarily the result of significant onetime charges
associated with a warranty reserve employee redundancy and recruitment costs
and a writedown of a facility held for sale partially offset by a favorable
legal settlement bookings and backlog were up due to a large order in the
nuclear equipment market for its crl business unit

     graphics microsystems had an outstanding year with record bookings sales
and earnings as it won significant business from six new key customers for its
color and ink control products it has been successful at changing its business
model moving its customer base from small and medium size printers in the
aftermarket to large printers and the highend new press oem market a new
product was added ribbon control which was successfully approved by an oem
customer as the standard for its presses a sizeable rd operation was

established in india which directly contributed to graphics microsystems
market growth by improving software quality and the overall development process

     swf had a disappointing year with declines in sales and a loss for the
year results continued to be adversely affected by high warranty costs and
product development expenses the lack of sustained bookings at a level for
efficient production was another significant negative factor in its performance
although market activity improved the closing cycle for capital investment in
packaging automation continued to increase the acquisition of gsma systems in
march of 2004 increased the companys capabilities by being able to provide
robotic solutions to complex handling problems

     dover industries sales increased 17 reflecting continued market share
gains helped by considerable new product introductions sales have now increased
for seven consecutive quarters earnings grew 14 driven by sales gains but
were offset by rising steel prices the largest contributors to earnings
increases were heil environmental due to share gains and chief automotive which
benefited from new product introductions

     heil environmentals performance improved versus 2003 despite significant
steel cost increases as a small decline in the refuse collection vehicle market
was offset by market share gains an increase in buying in municipal markets
increases in market share within the national account segment further
penetration into the independent hauler segment and an active new york city
market drove revenues to doubledigit gains bayne a 2001 acquisition also
contributed with record performance during the year driven primarily by newly
gained distribution heils european business grew as well increasing market
share in the municipal market

     rotary lift delivered improved sales driven partially by market share gains
in the important 2post segment of the market although much of the increase in
revenues was due to new product categories introduced in the latter half of 2003
that carry lower margins earnings were also hampered by escalating steel costs
and margin pressures from lowcost asian imports rotary continues to focus on
providing productivitybased solutions which has partially insulated it from
severe pricing pressures seen at the commodity end of the business rotarys
european operations enhanced by the acquisition of blitz in mid2003 delivered
double digit gains in their first full year as rotary lift europe total rotary
yearend backlog is up over 40 compared to 2003

     heil trailer the only global manufacturer of tank trailers recovered from
a weak 2003 a stronger us tank market improved results in argentina due to
pentup demand in the argentine and surrounding economies and strong
governmental sales at kalyn siebert drove the favorable comparisons however a
stagnant asian market hurt by ambivalent enforcement of truck weight limits
plant shutdown expenses in the uk and material cost escalations partially
offset this gain revenues were positively impacted by a full year of military
shipments although rising steel costs impacted profitability

     tipper tie reported its best results in over four years tippers
international operations which account for 60 of sales had another strong
year building from 2003s solid results despite weakness in the german market
the result of a consolidating retail environment international sales increased
over 10 driven by strength in eastern europe primarily russia poland
romania hungary and the baltic states alpina a swiss company acquired in
2000 delivered record sales and earnings surpassing its record performance in

2003 the us business rebounded moderately amid continued pricing pressures
tipper tie benefited from strength in the european currencies which was offset
by increased aluminum costs

     marathon delivered record sales driven by strength across its product line
recycling products had a strong year as baler sales increased behind new product
introductions and product redesigns marathon increased its market share due in
part to a large onetime order from a national account by leveraging its broad
product line and by focusing engineering efforts on identifying customer needs
this has led to increased new product activity that will continue into 2005
accordingly backlogs are up 19

     investments in products for major retail financial institutions and
global customers drove tritons sales to the highest level in its history
during the year triton produced its 100000thatm while achieving sales of
over 20000 units this year marked the transition from serving primarily
lowend retail atm markets to becoming a player in the mid to highend market of
major retail and financial institutions costs associated with these endeavors
hampered margins but set the stage for positive returns in 2005 and beyond in
canada unit sales were at an all time high while european unit sales climbed
over 30

     pdqs revenues were flat with the prior year as the in bay automatic
domestic market held relatively flat throughout the year after a relatively
strong start to the year poor weather and rising gas prices were negative
influences on orders which began to fall off in the third quarter sales to
major oil companies were up for the year but investor sales were flat as
hurricanes and heavy rain reduced nearterm car wash volume and therefore made
current investors reconsider their replacement and expansion plans for the year
new products introduced during the year were well received both the g5
sseries a higherend laser wash and the access machine a wash activation
unit delivered sales gains in excess of 50 but were not enough to make up for
a less active jobber market

     di foodservice which includes groen randell and avtec reported a
revenue decline and a 70 decline in earnings continued weakness in municipal
spending negatively impacted the institutional equipment market for the third
consecutive year 2004 saw numerous chain restaurant newstore openings being
delayed or put on hold earnings results were also impacted by a number of
adverse accrual adjustments that occurred during the year a management change
has been implemented and performance is expected to improve in 2005

     kurzkaschs revenues increased over 40 in 2004 primarily driven by the
effect of the acquisition of wabash magnetics at the end of 2003 strong
specialty plastics sales offset weakness in stator sales performance at wabash
was above expectations driven primarily by strength in its irrigation markets
profits at kurzkasch consolidated increased over 2003 levels but were impacted
by unfavorable product mix and plant closing costs associated with the wabash
acquisition

     despite a continued soft economy consolidation of the auto repair market
rising steel prices and insurance industry trends negatively impacting the
collision industry chief delivered its best performance since 2001 rebounding
from a difficult year in 2003 chief grew sales and earnings at double digit
rates fueled by the introduction of new pulling products and a 75 increase in
measuring equipment unit sales

     somero grew sales and earnings as the introduction of two new products
contributed to gains both domestically and internationally the sxp large screed
was developed to replace the original laser screed machine and sales of large
screeds doubled from 2003 levels the copperhead xd a product that primarily
serves the upper deck and smaller floor concrete screeding markets was improved
to add more power and torque and contributed to an 18 sales gain in copperhead
revenue international sales increased to 30 of total revenue driven by new
market penetration in europe and australia

     koolant koolers rode a recovery in the machine tool industry and posted
double digit sales and earnings gains in addition koolant koolers continued
its diversification into other markets and applications making significant
inroads into the food processing market in 2004 at schreiber a recovery in the
plastics and welding markets was partially offset by a slowdown in medical
shipments

growth and earnings in the first full year as a dover company warn experienced
record sales in power sports products strong growth in its branded truck
products and continued growth in powertrain products driven by increased demand
for light trucks and sport utility vehicles sales increases of 22 generated
earnings increases of 13 which included the impact of increased material costs

line of lifting and pulling products gained market acceptance at two major home
improvement retailers the continued flow of new products at warn is expected to
fuel future growth

     vitronics soltec performed very well in 2004 sales and earnings not only
grew 67 and 425 respectively but exceeded the record sales and earnings
level of 2000 vitronics soltec is gaining market share due to its leadership
role in lead free soldering strong market acceptance of its selective soldering

critical accounting policies

     the companys consolidated financial statements and related public
financial information are based on the application of generally accepted
accounting principles in the united states of america gaap gaap requires
the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of
accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue
and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental
information contained in the public disclosures of the company including
information regarding contingencies risk and its financial condition the
company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions
conform to gaap and are consistently applied valuations based on estimates are
reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company
primary areas where the financial information of dover is subject to the use of
estimates assumptions and the application of judgment include the following
areas

     revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following circumstances
are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists b price is
fixed or determinable c collectibility is reasonably assured and d delivery
has occurred in revenue transactions where installation is required revenue
can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the
functionality of the delivered products revenue transactions involving
nonessential installation obligations are those which can generally be
completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills
required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in
many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers if the
installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered
product revenues are deferred until installation is complete in a limited
number of revenue transactions other post shipment obligations such as training
and customer acceptance are required and accordingly revenues are deferred
until the customer is obligated to pay or acceptance has been confirmed
service revenues are recognized and earned when services are performed and are
not significant to any period presented

     allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating
companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on
historical losses adjusting for current economic conditions and in some cases
evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss the establishment of
reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential
for losses on receivable balances though dover considers these balances
adequate and proper changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which
the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required
in times of rapid market decline such as affected a number of technologies
companies in 2001 and 2002 reserve balances need to be adjusted in response to
these unusual circumstances

     inventory for the majority of the companys subsidiaries including all
international subsidiaries and the technologies segment are stated at the lower
of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or market other
domestic inventory is stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout
lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions
estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the
company to properly value inventory technologies companies tend to experience
higher levels of inventory value fluctuations particularly given the relatively
high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time

     occasionally the company will establish restructuring reserves at an
operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles these reserves
for both severance and exit costs require the use of estimates though dover
believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs actual
results may be different than the estimated amounts

     dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet
that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions the
valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful
depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use
of estimates the testing of these intangibles under established accounting
guidelines including sfas no 142 for impairment also requires significant use
of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the identification of
reporting units and the determination of fair market value dovers assets and
reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during
the fourth quarter or when there is a significant change in

circumstances the company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions
are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles changes
in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these
valuations

     the valuation of dovers pension and other postretirement plans requires
the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial
valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities these assumptions include
discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and
mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used in dovers pension reporting are
reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they
accurately account for dovers future pension obligations changes in
assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material
impact on dovers pension expenses and related funding requirements dovers
expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on
actual returns and portfolio allocation

     dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for
recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using
estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning
strategies reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal
state and international issues that are currently unresolved the company
routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it
is properly reserved valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be
impacted by changes in accounting regulations changes in tax codes and rulings
changes in statutory tax rates and the companys future taxable income levels

     dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management
program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to
risk exposure and ultimate liability the company estimates losses under these
programs using actuarial assumptions dovers experience and relevant industry
data dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate
relative to current market conditions and company experience

     dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at
both the operating company and corporate levels a significant amount of
judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dovers ultimate exposure
in these matters the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a
quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is
properly reserved reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in
circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves
for emerging issues while dover believes that the current level of reserves is
adequate future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations

     the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for
various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and
liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs
to sell these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds
anticipated as a result of the sale the adjustments to fair market value of
these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in
business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially
require future adjustments to these estimates

liquidity and capital resources

     management assesses the companys liquidity in terms of its ability to
generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating
activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends
adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit and the ability
to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company continues to
generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial
position with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing
businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a
short and longterm basis

cash flows used in investing activities    524853     435238
cash flows used in financing activities    100950      98281


     cash flow provided from operating activities during 2004 were up 42
compared to 2003 increases in cash flows from operations were primarily driven
by increased net earnings of 1199 million in 2004 while 1046 million in tax
refunds were received in 2003

     cash used in investing activities for 2004 rose to 5249 million from the
prior year reflecting an increase in acquisition activity from the prior year
the acquisition expenditures for 2004 were 5061 million compared to 3621
million in 2003 as the company completed eight new purchases the company is
hopeful that 2005 acquisition activity will be consistent with the 2004 level
but that will depend largely upon the availability and pricing of appropriate
acquisition candidates capital expenditures of 1074 million for the year were
110 million higher than in 2003 capital expenditures during 2004 and 2003
were funded by internal cash flow capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to
increase over 2004 levels

     cash used in financing activities during 2004 and 2003 were essentially
flat dividends paid of 1261 million in 2004 were the primary use of the cash
for financing activities in 2004 cash used in financing activities during 2003
primarily reflected a net 135 million increase of debt and dividend payments
of 1155 million during 2004 dover repaid approximately 9 million of
longterm debt and had 65 million of commercial paper outstanding as of
december 31 2004

     in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the
operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated
statements of cash flow the company also measures free cash flow management
believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance
because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash
generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt
dovers free cash flow for 2004 and 2003 remained essentially flat including a
large tax refund in 2003 the following table is a reconciliation of free cash
flow with cash flows from operating activities

     adjusted working capital calculated as accounts receivable plus
inventory less accounts payable increased from december 31 2003 by 2209
million or 200 to 1324 million primarily driven by increases in receivables
of 1651 million to 9127 million and increases in inventory of 1364 million

million excluding the impact of acquisitions on working capital of 1054
million and changes in foreign currency of 332 million working capital
increased by 821 million or 74 from december 31 2003 increases in

capital equipment markets remained soft the earnings increase was achieved
mainly through operational improvements volume and cost reduction efforts
record segment bookings improved 7 over the prior year hill phoenix swep and
belvac accounted for a large portion of the earnings gain which was somewhat
offset by declines at waukesha performance motorsports graphics microsystems
and crenlo

hill phoenix benefited from growth at several of its largest customers as well
as securing new key accounts hill phoenix has been able to outperform its
competition and gain market share in recent years due largely to industry
leading product innovation and strong customer service the improvement was
across all its business units as display cases refrigeration systems national
cooler and edp all showed a yearoveryear earnings increase a three point
operating margin improvement was achieved largely the result of leveraging
valueadded pricing and productivity gains all growth in 2003 and 2002 was
internal as there were no acquisitions impacting results

     sargents earnings were slightly down compared to the prior year as strong
military business and a successful addon acquisition were offset by the
extended commercial aerospace downturn record bookings improved 32 over the
prior year led by the marine division being awarded a large us military order
for submarine ship sets margins fell in 2003 largely due to an unfavorable
sales mix and the decision to invest in several development programs the sonic
business unit was hurt by continued airline cutbacks and a significant reduction
in production at their largest customer sargent aerospace canada a
manufacturer of airplane components in montreal canada was acquired in april
and produced positive results throughout the year

     performance motorsports earnings declined for the first time since being
acquired by diversified in 1998 due to several production issues and a weak
powersports market performance motorsports struggled throughout the year
integrating its december 2002 acquisition of chambon where volumes declined and
significant losses resulted perfect bore absorbed high production costs and
also reported a loss due to lingering production problems resulting from
internalizing a key manufacturing process that had previously been outsourced
performance motorsports two largest business units wiseco and je pistons both
had steady years and reported sales and earnings slightly ahead of prior year
after four consecutive quarters of unfavorable comparisons to the prior year
performance motorsports saw order intake increase in the fourth quarter and
earnings improved over the prior year despite market softness in 2003
performance motorsports maintained its market share and was well positioned to
improve as its markets recovered

     swep exceeded prior year bookings sales and earnings in every quarter in
2003 though the year started slow order activity improved in both its heat
pump and boiler markets and was very strong in the last nine months of the year
production capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity
programs to meet the growing demand backlog at the end of 2003 was 67 above
last year earnings were up 60 on a 24 increase in sales driven by cost
reduction favorable currency rates and a robust market its new central
warehouse in germany was fully consolidated in 2003 which drove down lead times
and reduced selling and administrative expenses though the price of stainless
steel dropped slightly late in the year potential increases in metal prices
threatened to affect near term margins

     in 2003 belvac reported its highest earnings in five years improving 64
over the prior year as the only independent global supplier of can forming
equipment belvacs recent success was in the nonus market especially russia
and australia where can manufacturing and consumer use is growing a
significant portion of its business includes spares and retrofits that improve
the productivity of its customers equipment further investment and advancement
in its plastic container equipment was beginning to complement its can forming
business and opening up new opportunities for growth in 2003 belvac began the
process of establishing a warehouse service center and related supply chains in
the czech republic

     waukesha had a strong finish to the year but still recorded a 15 earnings
decline on a 6 drop in revenue the weak power generation market continued to
negatively impact the bearings division and costs to close its south carolina
facility further reduced earnings this was the third time in two years that
bearings downsized its capacity due to the soft market demand on a positive
note the magnetics bearing group had a record year in sales and earnings as
project development work began to show a payback after a slow start to the
year the hydratight sweeney division had a solid comeback in the last three
quarters on strong torque and service business the tension business was down
for the year though bookings in its oil  gas markets improved in the fourth
quarter setting a good foundation for 2004 central research labs sales and
earnings were significantly down as orders for a number of large nuclear waste
cleanup projects were delayed into 2004 crl continues to develop the use of
their products with large oems in the pharmaceutical markets

     tranter phe set new bookings and sales records in 2003 though earnings
dropped below 2002 by 6 marine bookings came back strong especially with
shipyards in south korea another solid contributor was the north america
ethanol market that is being driven by investments in alternative energy
sources favorable currency translations due to the weakening of the dollar and
higher eurasian business also increased reported sales investments were made in
the india operations to add manufacturing and engineering capability to make
welded products for the eurasia market this facility attained the highest
quality approvals for its industry in 2003 ped pressure equipment directive
for europe and asme american society of mechanical engineers for north
america significant gains in productivity reduced lead times and ontime
delivery in the swedish manufacturing operations were also achieved

     mark andy earnings declined 12 on slightly lower sales as cost reduction
efforts did not offset weaker gross margins an unfavorable product mix
production startup problems on a new label press and higher warranty expenses
caused lower earnings in the st louis operations results improved at yearend
with fourth quarter earnings contributing over half of the years total
earnings the package printing equipment market further weakened in 2003 but
began to see some firming late in the year after a short rebound in label press
orders in 2002 bookings declined 13 in 2003 comco packaging press orders were
flat in 2003 although 2003 ended with its best quarterly bookings performance
since the acquisition in early 2001 improvements in sales coverage upgrades in
sales personnel and worldwide sales organization changes were made to
strengthen its position both us operations received iso certification and
lean manufacturing initiatives continued to drive improvement

     crenlo followed 2002s substantial turnaround with lower earnings despite
slightly increased volume earnings were down due to an unfavorable sales mix
rising medical natural gas and wage costs and costs associated with projects
that will generate future revenue the unfavorable sales mix is attributable to
a decline in the specialty enclosure business which has been negatively
impacted by a large customers restructuring following a merger the south
carolina facility continued to be hurt by underleveraged fixed costs and high
overtime resulting in the inability to reach consistent production levels on a
positive note cost reductions and productivity gains achieved in 2003
positioned crenlo to capitalize on higher volumes increased order activity in
the fourth quarter by several key customers provided cautious optimism for 2004
as shipment levels for the first quarter were projected to be higher

     graphics microsystems gmi sales grew 3 over 2002 despite the third
consecutive year of a decline in the printing industry the colorquick product
set a new sales record and required a realignment of its business resource and
processes gmi decided to target large growth opportunities and shifted its
business model from serving only small to medium size printers in the
aftermarket to a focus on large printers and the high end new press oem market
2003 earnings were negatively affected by necessary investments in rd price
concessions and technical service to pursue this new business

key managers were replaced and plant consolidations were finalized facilities
in florida and washington were consolidated into the california operation
resulting in overhead cost reduction and business simplification going forward
several large warranty issues were resolved in 2003 and new warranty claims
steadily declined throughout the year positive strides were made operationally
including the introduction of laser machining capabilities formally
establishing preferred suppliers restructuring the sales and engineering
organizations and the introduction of integrated work groups the internal
improvements achieved in 2003 swf to be more externally focused in 2004

     industries earned 12 less on essentially flat sales reflecting plant
closing costs and margin pressure from earlier in the year nevertheless
quarterly sales and earnings improved sequentially as the year progressed
fourth quarter results topped the previous three quarters reflecting market
share increases and improved market conditions across the majority of companies
the biggest contributors to earnings increases were pdq with strong new product
sales and tipper tie which benefited from strong overseas performance
capitalizing on the opening of the eastern european markets

     2003 was a challenging year for heil environmental earnings were down 30
as its market declined over 20 resulting in the lowest industry volume since
1997 municipal markets remained weak and pricing pressures continued
environmental closed down a facility and consolidated their two parts
businesses performance increased in the second half as both the third and
fourth quarters showed favorable comparisons to prior year and full year
bookings and backlog were up reflecting favorable year over year comparisons
overseas heil was able to leverage a strong uk market while increasing share

     rotary lifts 2003 sales were enhanced by the may 2003 acquisition of
blitz a german lift manufacturer however integrating the existing rotary lift
italian operations into blitz negatively impacted earnings north american sales
fell slightly as the industry declined and competitive pressures led to
contracting margins for the full year rotary lifts sales grew 5 and earnings
were flat however a number of new products were introduced in the latter half
of the year resulting in sales growth of over 8 in the second half backlog
was up over 50 leading to optimism heading into 2004

     industry declines impacted heil trailer as the us tank trailer markets
decreased for the fourth consecutive year reacting to the contraction trailer
closed two facilities during 2003 despite continued price competition trailer
was able to grow share in both the petroleum and dry bulk markets business
began to pick up later in the year as fourth quarter revenues in 2003 were 16
above 2002 levels military shipments began in earnest in the fourth quarter of
2003 and will account for an additional 200 million of sales in 2004 the
result of a military contract awarded to heil in late 2003 kalyn siebert a
heil trailer subsidiary benefited from this strong military volume as revenues
almost doubled for the year

     tipper ties european operations achieved record sales driven by strong
performance in eastern europe earnings improved 21 on a sales increase of 9
alpina a 2000 acquisition surpassed 2003s record results as it continued to
expand its product line into new geographic regions the us business continued
to be challenged amid a weak capital equipment market and continued pricing
pressure

     marathons sales and margins declined three percentage points in 2003 which
were primarily the result of pricing pressures driven by market weakness the
waste equipment market was down adjusting to the overcapacity of production in
the industry ultimately leading to price erosion as a result marathon closed
a facility while reducing headcount by over 10 strength in their recycling
systems group helped stem the tide and was viewed as a key growth area for
2004

     triton which saw significant improvement in 2002 delivered record
revenues in 2003 although earnings were relatively flat because of new product
startup costs unit sales were up over 10 in a flat us market resulting in
share gains again in 2003 these gains were attributable to the success of the
9100 product line which was introduced in mid2002 and focuses on the broadest
segment of the cash dispenser market it represented more than two thirds of
2003 unit sales volume tritons strong new product focus continued in 2003 as
two key products were introduced late in the year the ft5000 is a
throughthewall model aimed at the financial institution market while the
rl5000 is aimed principally at the retail market internationally

                                        38

both the uk and canadian markets remained strong and market share increased in
both of these key focus regions as 2003 ended triton expected to enter
additional countries in 2004 and international markets accounted for
approximately 35 of unit sales

     pdqs record fourth quarter results contributed to solid yearoveryear
gains earnings increased 22 while sales increased 12 an increase in major
oil and gas station business coupled with continued strong investor demand drove
the lateyear surge market share continued to increase although competitors
were beginning to have an impact on the lowend market a major driver in 2002
was the introduction and customer acceptance of several new products one of
which a higherend laser wash accounted for over 30 of sales in the fourth
quarter in 2003

     declining tax revenues for most states counties and municipalities led to
a slowdown in di foodservices institutional foodservice equipment market
continuing a trend which began in 2002 however both groen and randell were
able to grow market share during 2003 there was a pickup in chain restaurant
sales as many experienced strong samestoresales growth in the later half of
2003 institutional markets will continue to struggle although renovation and
replacements have shown some growth in 2003 and are expected to continue into
2004 consolidation costs experienced in 2003 to bring the groen randell and
avtec businesses under the di foodservice umbrella were expected to positively
impact margins in 2004

     kurzkasch rebounded from a challenging 2002 as revenues and earnings
increased in 2003 over 10 driven by the successful integration of
businessproduct lines acquired in late 2002 in addition kurz kasch purchased
wabash magnetics a manufacturer of actuators and sensors in december of 2003
this acquisition positioned kurzkasch to expand into the medical and irrigation
markets among others

     dovatechs performance in 2003 benefited from strength in both the chiller
and laser businesses a pickup in semiconductor demand drove the laser business
performance while strong sales into the medical market resulted in the chiller
business growing over 18 strength in chief automotives computerized measuring
products was more than offset by market contraction in the framestraightening
market somero partially offset significant market weakness with the successful
introduction of the copperhead a walkbehind laser screed which accounted
for over 60 of unit sales in 2003

payable provides a meaningful measure of the companys operational results by
showing the changes caused solely by sales in addition management believes
that reporting operational working capital and revenues at constant currency
which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates provides a meaningful measure of the companys
operational changes given the global nature of dovers businesses management
also believes that reporting organic sales growth which excludes the impact of
foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions provides a

investment in foreign operations as of december 31 2004 the company had not
established a formal companywide foreigncurrency hedging program but may from
time to time for a specific exposure enter into fair value hedges the company
has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure
through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the

business strategy

     the company operates with certain fundamental objectives first it seeks
to acquire and own businesses with proprietary engineered industrial products
which make them leaders in the niche markets which they serve second these
businesses should be customer focused innovative and well managed to achieve
above average profit margins by supplying customers with value added products
and related services third the company expects that these types of businesses
will generate strong cash flow which can not only sustain such operations but
also provide excess cash flow which the company can then reinvest in similar
business opportunities

     the company expects to manage its cash flow so that the mix of its external
debt levels and capital structure are optimized to support continued ready
access to the capital markets

management philosophy

     the company practices a highly decentralized management style the
presidents of the operating companies are given a great deal of autonomy and
have a high level of independent responsibility for their businesses and their
performance this is in keeping with the companys operating philosophy that
independent operations are better able to serve customers by focusing closely on
their products and reacting quickly to customer needs the companys executive
management role is to provide management oversight allocate and manage capital
assist in major acquisitions evaluate motivate and as necessary replace
operating management and provide selected other services

acquisitions and divestitures

     the company has a longstanding acquisition program the company seeks to
acquire and develop platform businesses which are marked by growth
innovation and higher than average profit margins each of its businesses should
be a leader in its market as measured by market share customer service
innovation profitability and return on assets the company traditionally
focuses on acquiring new businesses which could operate independently from other
dover companies standalones over the last ten years increased emphasis
has been placed on acquiring businesses that can be added on to existing
operations addons the target companies are generally manufacturers of high
valueadded engineered products sold to a broad customer base of industrial or
commercial users one of the most critical factors in the decision to acquire a
business is the companys judgment of the skill energy ethics and
compatibility of the top executives at the

                                        2

acquisition target dover expects that acquired companies will continue to be
operated by the management team in place at acquisition with a high degree of
autonomy in keeping with the companys decentralized structure from january 1
1999 through december 31 2003 the company made 66 acquisitions at a total
acquisition cost of 18154 million in 2003 the company completed one
standalone and five addon acquisitions at a total cost of 3621 million for
more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years see note
2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 these acquisitions have
had a substantial impact on the companys sales and earnings since 1999 during
the past three years the overall number of company acquisitions and dollars
invested has been dropping this largely reflects the general economic
conditions and the lack of attractive acquisition candidates the companys
future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful
businesses as a number of the companys current businesses operate in
relatively mature markets where sustained internal growth objectives are
difficult to achieve

     while the company expects to buy and hold businesses it does periodically
reassess each business to verify that it continues to represent a good longterm
investment there may also be situations where a company business represents a
very attractive acquisition for another company based on specific market
conditions based on these criteria the company has divested businesses over
the past three years the company has been more proactive in evaluating its
operating companies against internal growth and profitability criteria during
that time the company has discontinued 16 operations and subsequently sold 11
for an aggregate consideration of 3859 million for more details see the
discontinued operations discussion below and note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements in item 8

from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single
supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on
operating profits during 2002 steel tariffs were imposed on the importation of
certain steel products which had a slight adverse impact on a number of dover
operating companies which use large amounts of steel these tariffs remained in
effect throughout most of 2003 and were repealed late in the year steel prices
are expected to remain relatively high during 2004 which will have an impact on
a number of dover operating companies

research and development

     dovers operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well
as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand
sales opportunities maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product
reliability and reduce production costs during 2003 approximately 1587
million was spent on research and development compared with 1662 million and
1682 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively

     for the technologies companies efforts in these areas tend to be
particularly significant because the rate of product development by their
customers is often quite high in general the technologies companies that
provide electronic assembly equipment and services can anticipate that the
performance capabilities of such equipment are expected to improve significantly
over time with a concurrent expectation of lower operating costs and increasing
efficiency likewise technologies companies developing specialty electronic
components for the datacom and telecom commercial markets anticipate a
continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced cost such that
product life cycles generally average less than five years with meaningful sales
price reductions over that time period

     industries resources and diversified contain many businesses that are also
involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also
concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications
expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving
manufacturing processes only a few of these businesses experience the same rate
of change in their markets and products that is experienced generally by the
technologies businesses

intellectual property

     the company has a number of patents trademarks licenses and other forms
of intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and
to the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large
portion of the companys intellectual property consists of confidential and
proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the company seeks to
protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and
suppliers where appropriate while the companys intellectual property is
important to its success the loss or expiration of any significant portion of
these rights would not materially affect the company or any of its segments the
company believes that its commitment to continuous engineering improvements new
product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong
sales marketing and service efforts are significant to its general leadership
position in the niche markets that it serves

seasonality

     in general dovers operations while not seasonal tend to have stronger
revenues in the second and third quarters in particular those companies
serving the transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial
refrigeration and food service markets tend to be strong during the second and
third quarters companies serving the major equipment markets such as power
generation chemical and processing

                                        11
page

industries tend to have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or
consumer demands which tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and
delivery to coincide with those market trends

customers

     dovers businesses serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted
for more than 10 of the companys consolidated revenues in 2003 within each of
the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segments
sales in 2003

     in the technologies segment the rapid growth in datacomtelecom
infrastructure market development during the period 19972000 involving both
equipment providers and software developers such as lucent motorola nortel
cisco siemens phillips and qualcomm tended to concentrate the new product
development and demand with relatively few customers at the same time a number
of these customers outsourced a significant amount of their manufacturing
capability to electronic manufacturing services ems companies such as jabil
solectron celestica and flextronics which firms are now the direct customers
of technologies companies for a number of different oem customers given the
significant downturn in these markets since 2000 and the shift in
manufacturing this has tended to increase the concentration of manufacturing
with the emss companies particularly with those located in china hence
machine and specialty component demand is concentrated with a smaller number of
customers the more significant chinese customers are foxconn asustek
inventec wistron and arima

     in the other dover segments customer concentrations are quite varied
companies supplying the automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend
to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries
this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation
aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually
a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies
provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad
range of end use applications

backlog

     backlog generally is not a significant factor in most of dovers
businesses as most of dovers products have relatively short ordertodelivery
periods it is more relevant to those businesses in the segments which produce
larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts
primarily in the diversified segment as well as the heil companies from the
industries segment and the cbat and sec companies from the technologies segment
total company backlog as of december 31 2003 and 2002 was 8229 million and
6499 million respectively

competition

     dovers competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of
products manufactured and markets served in general most dover companies are
market leaders which compete with only a few companies and the key competitive
factors are customer service product quality and innovation in addition since
most of dovers manufacturing operations are in the united states dover usually
is a more significant competitor domestically than in foreign markets

     in the technologies segment dover competes globally against a few very
large companies primarily operating in japan europe and the far east its
primary competitors are japanese producers including fuji machine panasonic
and tdk and european manufacturers like philips and siemens

     within the other segments competition is primarily domestic although an
increasing number of dover companies see more international competitors and
several serve markets which are predominantly international particularly
belvac quartzdyne rpa process technologies tipper tie tranter and waukesha

international

companys continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements in item no 8 of this form 10k

page

     although international operations are subject to certain risks such as
price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign governmental restrictions
dover intends to increase its expansion into foreign markets including south
america asia and eastern europe

     the countries where most of dovers foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are
based are france germany the uk the netherlands sweden and switzerland
and with increased emphasis china

environmental matters

     dover believes its operations generally are in substantial compliance with
applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses
have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental
agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of
regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with
specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued
compliance will not have any material impact on the companys financial position
going forward and will not require significant capital expenditures

employees

     the company had approximately 25700 employees as of december 31 2003

item 3  legal proceedings

     a few of the companys subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings
relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and
state statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among potentially
responsible parties in each instance the extent of the companys liability
appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the
number of other potentially responsible parties involved and is anticipated to
be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the companys subsidiaries
are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in
cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been
established

     the company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of
other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses management and legal
counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs
and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of
insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible at this
time to predict the outcome of these legal actions in the opinion of
management based on these reviews it is remote that the disposition of the
lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse
effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

     no matter was submitted to a vote of the companys security holders in the

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

summary

     sales for 2003 of 44133 million were up 3597 million or 9 from 2002
primarily driven by increases of 1948 million at technologies and 1098
million at resources technologies sales were impacted by recovery in the
electronics industry resources sales increased due to improved market
conditions and the acquisition of warn industries diversifieds sales increased
525 million while industries sales were essentially flat sales would have
increased 46 to 42381 million if 2002 foreign currency translation rates
were applied to 2003 results acquisitions completed during 2003 contributed
677 million to sales and gross profit of 184 million gross profit of
15204 million in 2003 represented a 14 improvement compared to 13309
million in 2002 gross profit for 2002 included approximately 120 million of
inventory provisions primarily incurred by technologies and to a lesser extent
diversified gross profit margins of 345 for 2003 compared to 328 for 2002
and were positively impacted by increased volume levels and the prior years
operational realignment and restructuring

     selling and administrative expenses for 2003 were 10767 million or 24
of net sales compared to 9962 million or 25 of net sales in 2002 selling
and administrative expenses for 2002 included approximately 287 million of
restructuring provisions primarily incurred by technologies and to a lesser
extent industries and diversified operating profit of 4438 million for 2003
increased 1090 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 9
increase in revenues benefits from the companys restructuring programs
undertaken during 2002 and 2001 and slightly improved global economic
conditions operating profit margin for 2003 was 101 compared to 83 for
2002

     net interest expense decreased 4 to 622 million for 2003 comparable to
648 million for 2002 the primary reasons for the decrease in net interest
expense was the decrease in longterm debt during the year of approximately 26
million higher levels of interest bearing cash equivalents in addition to
interest income related to the companys outstanding interest rate swaps on some
of its longterm debt

     other net expenses for 2003 were 97 million and primarily related to
foreign exchange losses of 62 million and legal settlements at the industries
and resources segments other expenses of 66 million for 2002 primarily
related to foreign exchange losses of 60 million the foreign exchange losses
in both 2003 and 2002 primarily relate to appreciation of the euro against the
us dollar

     dovers effective 2003 tax rate for continuing operations was 233
compared to 2002s rate of 211 the low effective tax rate for both years is
largely due to the continuing benefit from tax credit programs such as those for
rd combined with the benefit from us export programs lower effective foreign
tax rates from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the
recognition of certain capital loss benefits

     net earnings from continuing operations for 2003 were 2852 million or
140 per diluted share compared to 2078 million or 102 per diluted share
from continuing operations in 2002 for 2003 net earnings before cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle were 2929 million or 144 per
diluted share including 77 million or 04 per diluted share in earnings from
discontinued operations compared to 1718 million or 84 per diluted share
for 2002 which included 361 million or 18 per diluted share in losses from
discontinued operations

     discontinued operations earnings for 2003 were 77 million compared to
losses of 361 million in 2002 during 2003 in connection with the completion
of a federal income tax audit and commercial resolution of other issues the
company adjusted certain reserves established in connection with the sales of
previously discontinued operations and recorded a gain on the sales of
discontinued operations net of tax of 166 million and additional tax benefits
of 51 million related to losses previously incurred on sales of business
these amounts were offset by charges of 136 million net of tax to reduce
discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value and a loss on the sale of
discontinued operations net of tax of 60 million related to contingent
liabilities from previously discontinued operations total losses from
discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001 primarily relate to charges to reduce
discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value refer to note 7 in the
consolidated financial statements in item 8

     diversifieds earnings increased 3 in 2003 on a 5 sales increase as
capital equipment markets remained soft the earnings increase was achieved
mainly through operational improvements volume and cost reduction efforts
record segment bookings improved 7 over the prior year hill phoenix swep and
belvac accounted for a large portion of the earnings gain which was somewhat
offset by declines at waukesha performance motorsports graphics microsystems
and crenlo

     hill phoenix reported its second consecutive record year setting new highs
in sales earnings and cash flow again leading diversified in each of these
three categories despite its overall market being down hill phoenix benefited
from growth at several of its largest customers as well as securing new key
accounts hill phoenix has been able to outperform its competition and gain
market share in recent years due largely to industry leading product innovation
and strong customer service the improvement was across all its business units
as display cases refrigeration systems national cooler and edp all showed a
yearoveryear earnings increase a three point operating margin improvement was
achieved largely the result of leveraging valueadded pricing and productivity
gains all growth over the last two years was internal as there were no
acquisitions impacting results growth is expected to slow somewhat in 2004
although hill phoenix expects to deliver another strong performance as the
capital programs of its large customers are expected to remain strong

     sargents earnings were slightly down compared to the prior year as strong
military business and a successful addon acquisition were offset by the
extended commercial aerospace downturn record bookings improved 32 over prior
year led by the marine division being awarded a large us military order for
submarine ship sets margins fell in 2003 largely due to an unfavorable sales
mix and the decision to invest in several development programs the sonic
business unit was hurt by continued airline cutbacks and a significant reduction
in production at their largest customer sargent aerospace canada a
manufacturer of airplane components in montreal canada was acquired in april
and produced positive results throughout the year

     performance motorsports earnings declined for the first time since being
acquired by diversified in 1998 due to several production issues and a weak
powersports market performance motorsports struggled throughout the year
integrating its december 2002 acquisition of chambon where volumes declined and
significant losses resulted perfect bore absorbed high production costs and
also reported a loss due to lingering production problems resulting from
internalizing a key manufacturing process that had previously been outsourced
performance motorsports two largest business units wiseco and je pistons both
had steady years and reported sales and earnings slightly ahead of prior year
after four consecutive quarters of unfavorable comparisons to the prior year
performance motorsports saw order intake increase in the fourth quarter and
earnings improved over the prior year despite market softness in 2003
performance motorsports maintained its market share and is well positioned to
improve as its markets recover

     swep exceeded prior year bookings sales and earnings in every quarter in
2003 though the year started slow order activity improved in both its heat
pump and boiler markets and was very strong in the last nine months of the year
production capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity
programs to meet the growing demand backlog at the end of 2003 was 67 above
last year earnings were up 60 on a 24 increase in sales driven by cost
reduction favorable currency rates and a robust market its new central
warehouse in germany was fully consolidated in 2003 which drove down lead times
and reduced selling and administrative expenses though the price of stainless
steel dropped slightly late in the year potential increases in metal prices may
affect near term margins

     belvac reported its highest earnings in five years improving 64 over
prior year as the only independent global supplier of can forming equipment
belvacs recent success has been in the nonus market especially russia and
australia where can manufacturing and consumer use is growing a significant
portion of its business includes spares and retrofits that improve the
productivity of its customers equipment further investment and advancement in
its plastic container equipment is beginning to complement its can forming
business and is opening up new opportunities for growth belvac began the
process of establishing a warehouse service center and related supply chains in
the czech republic and the facility will be fully operational in 2004

     waukesha had a strong finish to the year but still recorded a 15 earnings
decline on a 6 drop in revenue the weak power generation market continued to
negatively impact the bearings division and costs to close its south carolina
facility further reduced earnings this was the third time in two years that
bearings down sized its capacity due to the soft market demand on a positive
note the magnetics bearing group had a record year in sales and earnings as
project development work is beginning to show a payback after a slow start to
the year the hydratight sweeney division had a solid comeback in the last three
quarters on strong torque and service business the tension business was down
for the year though bookings in its oil  gas markets improved in the fourth
quarter setting a good foundation for 2004 central research labs sales and
earnings were significantly down as orders for a number of large nuclear waste
cleanup projects were delayed into 2004 crl continues to develop the use of
their products with large oems in the pharmaceutical markets

     tranter phe set new bookings and sales records in 2003 though earnings
dropped below last year by 6 marine bookings came back strong especially with
shipyards in south korea another solid contributor was the north america
ethanol market that is being driven by investments in alternative energy
sources favorable currency translations due to the weakening of the dollar and
higher eurasian business also increased reported sales investments were made in
the india operations to add manufacturing and engineering capability to make
welded products for the eurasia market this facility attained the highest
quality approvals for its industry in 2003  ped pressure equipment directive
for europe and asme american society of mechanical engineers for north
america significant gains in productivity reduced lead times and on time
delivery in the swedish manufacturing operations were also achieved tranter is
well positioned to benefit from what seems to be a pent up demand in many of its
markets

     mark andy earnings declined 12 on slightly lower sales as cost reduction
efforts did not offset weaker gross margins an unfavorable product mix
production startup problems on a new label press and higher warranty expenses
caused lower earnings in the st louis operations results improved at yearend
with fourth quarter earnings contributing over half of the years total
earnings the package printing equipment market further weakened in 2003 but
began to see some firming late in the year after a short rebound in label press
orders in 2002 bookings declined 13 in 2003 comco packaging press orders were
flat in 2003 although 2003 ended with its best quarterly bookings performance
since the acquisition in early 2001 improvements in sales coverage upgrades in
sales personnel and worldwide sales organization changes were made to
strengthen its position both us operations received iso certification and
lean manufacturing initiatives continue to drive improvement

     crenlo followed 2002s substantial turnaround with lower earnings despite
slightly increased volume earnings were down due to an unfavorable sales mix
rising medical natural gas and wage costs and costs associated with projects
that will generate future revenue the unfavorable sales mix is attributable to

                                        20

a decline in the specialty enclosure business which has been negatively
impacted by a large customers restructuring following a merger the south
carolina facility continued to be hurt by underleveraged fixed costs and high
overtime resulting in the inability to reach consistent production levels on a
positive note cost reductions and productivity gains achieved in 2003 have
crenlo well positioned to capitalize on higher volumes increased order activity
in the fourth quarter by several key customers provides cautious optimism going
into 2004 as shipment levels for the first quarter are projected to be higher

     graphics microsystems gmi sales grew 3 over 2002 despite the third
consecutive year of a decline in the printing industry the colorquick product
set a new sales record and has required a realignment of its business resource
and processes gmi has decided to target large growth opportunities and has
shifted its business model from only serving small to medium size printers in
the aftermarket to a focus on large printers and the high end new press oem
market 2003 earnings were negatively affected by necessary investments in rd
price concessions and technical service to pursue this new business

     swf completed a year of transition reporting breakeven results as several
key managers were replaced and plant consolidations were finalized facilities
in florida and washington were consolidated into the california operation
resulting in overhead cost reduction and business simplification going forward
several large warranty issues were resolved in 2003 and new warranty claims
steadily declined throughout the year positive strides were made operationally
including the introduction of laser machining capabilities formally
establishing preferred suppliers restructuring the sales and engineering
organizations and the introduction of integrated work groups the internal
improvements achieved in 2003 will allow swf to be more externally focused in
2004

     industries earned 12 less on essentially flat sales reflecting plant
closing costs and margin pressure from earlier in the year nevertheless
quarterly sales and earnings improved sequentially as the year progressed
fourth quarter results topped the previous three quarters reflecting market
share increases and improved market conditions across the majority of companies
the biggest contributors to earnings increases were pdq with strong new product
sales and tipper tie which benefited from strong overseas performance
capitalizing on the opening of the eastern european markets

     2003 was a challenging year for heil environmental earnings were down 30
as its market declined over 20 resulting in the lowest industry volume since
1997 municipal markets remained weak and pricing pressures continued
environmental closed down a facility and consolidated their two parts
businesses performance increased in the second half as both the third and
fourth quarters showed favorable comparisons to prior year and full year
bookings and backlog were up reflecting favorable year over year comparisons
overseas heil was able to leverage a strong uk market while increasing share

     rotary lifts sales were enhanced by the may 2003 acquisition of blitz a
german lift manufacturer however integrating the existing rotary lift italian
operations into blitz negatively impacted earnings north american sales fell
slightly as the industry declined and competitive pressures led to contracting
margins for the full year rotary lifts sales grew 5 and earnings were flat
however a number of new products were introduced in latter half of the year
resulting in sales growth of over 8 in the second half backlog is up over 50
leading to optimism heading into 2004

     industry declines impacted heil trailer as the us tank trailer markets
decreased for the fourth consecutive year reacting to the contraction trailer
closed two facilities during the year despite continued price competition
trailer was able to grow share in both the petroleum and dry bulk markets
business began to pick up later in the year as fourth quarter revenues were 16
above 2002 levels military shipments began in earnest in the fourth quarter
and will account for an additional 200 million of sales in 2004 the result of
a military contract awarded to heil in late 2003 kalyn siebert a heil trailer
subsidiary benefited from this strong military volume as revenues almost
doubled for the year

     tipper ties european operations achieved record sales driven by strong
performance in eastern europe earnings improved 21 on a sales increase of 9
alpina a 2000 acquisition surpassed last years record results as they
continue to expand their product line into new geographic regions the us
business continues to be challenged amid a weak capital equipment market and
continued pricing pressure however the declines witnessed last year have been
stemmed and a rebound is expected in 2004

     marathons sales and margins declined three percentage points in 2003 which
were primarily the result of pricing pressures driven by market weakness the
waste equipment market was down adjusting to the overcapacity of production in
the industry ultimately leading to price erosion as a result marathon closed
a facility while reducing headcount by over 10 strength in their recycling
systems group helped stem the tide and will be a key growth area in 2004

     triton which saw significant improvement in 2002 delivered record
revenues in 2003 although earnings were relatively flat because of new product
startup costs unit sales were up over 10 in a flat us market resulting in
share gains again in 2003 these gains were attributable to the success of the
9100 product line which was introduced mid2002 and focuses on the broadest
segment of the cash dispenser market it now represents more than two thirds of
2003 unit sales volume their strong new product focus continued in 2003 as two
key products were introduced late in the year the ft5000 is a throughthewall
model aimed at the financial institution market while the rl5000 is aimed
principally at the retail market internationally both the uk and canadian
markets remained strong and market share increased in both of these key focus
regions triton expects to enter additional countries in 2004 as international
markets currently account for approximately 35 of unit sales

     pdqs record fourth quarter results contributed to solid yearoveryear
gains earnings increased 22 while sales increased 12 an increase in major
oil and gas station business coupled with continued strong investor demand drove
the late year surge market share continues to increase although competitors
are beginning to have an impact on the lowend market a major driver in 2002
was the introduction and customer acceptance of several new products one of
which a higherend laser wash accounted for over 30 of sales in the fourth
quarter

     declining tax revenues for most states counties and municipalities led to
a slowdown in di foodservices institutional foodservice equipment market
continuing a trend which began last year however both groen and randell were
able to grow market share during the year there has been a pickup in chain
restaurant sales as many experienced strong samestoresales growth in the
later half of the year institutional markets will continue to struggle
although renovation and replacements have shown some growth in 2003 and are
expected to continue into 2004 consolidation costs experienced in 2003 to bring
the groen randell and avtec businesses under the di foodservice umbrella will
positively impact margins in 2004

     kurzkasch rebounded from a challenging 2002 as revenues and earnings
increased over 10 driven by the successful integration of businessproduct
lines acquired in late 2002 in addition kurz kasch purchased wabash magnetics
a manufacturer of actuators and sensors in december of 2003 this acquisition
will allow kurzkasch to expand into the medical and irrigation markets among
others

     dovatechs performance benefited from strength in both the chiller and
laser businesses a pickup in semiconductor demand drove the laser business
performance while strong sales into the medical market resulted in the chiller
business growing over 18 strength in chief automotives computerized measuring
products was more than offset by market contraction in the framestraightening

terrain vehicles and fourwheel drive vehicles in addition warn is a leading
manufacturer of all wheel drive and fourwheel drive disconnect

improvements in channel management provided very positive results the german
and french operations achieved significant improvement in earnings the

basis wildens nonus sales grew 20 and were enhanced by the opening of a
manufacturing facility in china which exceeded first year plan results and
growth in their argentina operation as that economy began to recover

million earnings improved significantly to 73 million when compared to a loss
of 121 million last year the 2002 loss included inventory restructuring and
other charges of 99 million substantially all of this earnings growth came in
the fourth quarter as the first three quarters were basically flat on a
yeartoyear comparison during 2003 the sec companies made considerable
efforts to expand their customer base and industries served telecom products
were a lesser portion of the overall businesses as military space avionics
medical automotive and other industrial applications grew as a percent of
sales towards the end of 2003 even telecom customers increased their spending
with indications that this trend will continue into 2004

     vectron formerly referred to as quadrant the largest of the sec
companies reported an increase in sales of 5 for the year but 23 for the
fourth quarter alone margins improved to 10 in the fourth quarter earnings

industrial markets as its base station customers consolidated their supply
chains kl found much of its planned asian telecom infrastructure business had
diminished accordingly kl has exited all asian manufacturing leaving in
place a sales and marketing team to respond to appropriate opportunities this
realignment of its business resulted in a loss for kl for 2003

related to these new capabilities grew to 21 of equipment sales from 17 in
2002 while at the same time ink jet unit sales grew 17 year over year

     imaje has a strong global presence sales for 2003 as compared to 2002
were enhanced by a 20 strengthening of the euro against the dollar however
margins continue to be pressured as the majority of imajes product costs are
incurred in euros while significant amounts of revenues are denominated in us
dollars consequently imaje is in the process of expanding its production and

critical accounting policies

     the companys consolidated financial statements and related public
financial information are based on the application of generally accepted
accounting principles in the united states of america gaap gaap requires
the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of
accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue
and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental
information contained in the external disclosures of the company including
information regarding contingencies risk and its financial condition the
company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions
conform to gaap and are consistently applied valuations based on estimates are
reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company
primary areas where the financial information of dover is subject to the use of
estimates assumptions and the application of judgment include the following

     revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following circumstances
are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists b price is
fixed or determinable c collectibility is reasonably assured and d delivery
has occurred in revenue transactions where installation is required revenue
can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the
functionality of the delivered products revenue transactions involving
nonessential installation obligations are those which can generally be
completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills
required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in
many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers if the
installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered
product revenues are deferred until installation is complete in a limited
number of revenue transactions other post shipment obligations such as training
and customer acceptance are required and accordingly revenues are deferred
until the customer is obligated to pay or acceptance has been confirmed
service revenues are recognized and earned when services are performed and are
not significant to any period presented

     allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating
companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on
historical losses adjusting for current economic conditions and in some cases
evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss the establishment of
reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential
for losses on receivable balances though dover considers these balances
adequate and proper changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which
the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required
in times of rapid market decline such as affected a number of technologies
companies in 2001 and 2002 reserve balances needed to be adjusted in response
to these unusual circumstances

     inventory for the majority of the companys subsidiaries including all
international subsidiaries and the technologies segment are stated at the lower
of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or market other
domestic inventory is stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout
lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions
estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the
company to properly value inventory technologies companies tend to experience
higher levels of inventory value fluctuations particularly given the relatively
high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time

     occasionally the company will establish restructuring reserves at an
operation these reserves for both severance and exit costs require the use of
estimates though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the
costs of these plans actual results may be different than the estimated
amounts

     dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet
that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions the
valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful
depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use
of estimates the testing of these intangibles under established accounting
guidelines including sfas no 142 for impairment also requires significant use
of judgment and assumptions particularly as it relates to the identification of
reporting units and the determination of fair market value dovers assets and
reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during
the fourth quarter or when there is a significant change in circumstances the
company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and
comply
                                        27

with generally accepted accounting principles changes in business conditions
could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations

     the valuation of dovers pension and other postretirement plans requires
the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial
valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities these assumptions include
discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and
mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used in dovers pension reporting are
reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they
accurately account for dovers future pension obligations changes in
assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material
impact on dovers pension expenses and related funding requirements dovers
expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on
actual returns and portfolio allocation

     dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for
recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using
estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning
strategies reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal
state and international issues that are currently unresolved the company
routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it
is properly reserved valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be
impacted by changes to tax codes and rulings changes in statutory tax rates and
the companys future taxable income levels

     dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management
program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment in regards to
risk exposure and ultimate liability the company estimates losses under these
programs using actuarial assumptions dover experience and relevant industry
data dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate
relative to current market conditions and company experience

     dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at
both the operating company and corporate levels a significant amount of
judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dovers ultimate exposure
in these matters the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a
quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is
properly reserved reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in
circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves
for emerging issues while dover believes that the current level of reserves is
adequate changes in the future could impact these determinations

     the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for
various reasons estimates are used to adjust if necessary the assets and
liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs
to sell these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds
anticipated as a result of the sale the adjustments to fair market value of
these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold changes in
business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially
require future adjustments to these estimates

liquidity and capital resources

     management assesses the companys liquidity in terms of its ability to
generate cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating
activities capital expenditures acquisitions dispositions dividends
adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit and the ability
to attract longterm capital with satisfactory terms the company continues to
generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial
position with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing
businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a
short and longterm basis

     the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash
flows



                                                               twelve months ended
                                                                  december 31

                                                                 in thousands
                                                                    
cash flows provided by operating activities   593666    357144
cash flows used in investing activities   448600   179451
cash flows used in financing activities    98281   140070


     cash flow provided from operating activities during 2003 was 2365 million
higher than 2002 increases in cash flows from operations were primarily driven
by increased net earnings of 774 million and tax refunds of 1515 million

     cash used in investing activities for 2003 rose 2691 million from the
prior year reflecting an increase in acquisition activity from the prior year
the acquisition expenditures for 2003 were 3621 million compared to 997
million in 2002 acquisitions expenditures during 2003 were primarily related to
the purchase of warn for 3260 million the company expects that 2004
acquisition activity will be consistent with the 2003 level but will depend
largely upon the availability and pricing of appropriate acquisition candidates
capital expenditures were essentially flat at 964 million for both 2003 and
2002 capital expenditures during 2003 and 2002 were funded by internal cash
flow capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to increase slightly over 2003
levels

     cash used in financing activities during 2003 was down 418 million
compared to 2002 dividends paid of 1155 million was the primary use of the
cash offset by a net increase in debt of 135 million cash used in financing
activities during 2002 primarily reflected a net 215 million decrease of debt
and dividend payments of 1094 million during 2003 dover repaid approximately
264 million of longterm debt and had 400 million of commercial paper
outstanding as of december 31 2003

     in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the
operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated
statement of cash flow the company also measures free cash flow management
believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance
because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash
generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt
dovers free cash flow for 2003 increased significantly as cash generated from
operations improved 2365 million from 2002 the following table is a
reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities

     the companys cash and cash equivalents increased 26 during 2003 to 3704
million at december 31 2003 compared to 2938 million at december 31 2002

     working capital calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory less
accounts payable increased from december 31 2002 by 1038 million or 101 to
10242 million primarily driven by increases in receivables of 1057 million
to 7476 million and increases in inventory of 658 million to 6393 million
offset by increases in payables of 677 million to 2589 million excluding
the impact of acquisitions on working capital of 589 million and changes in
foreign currency of 607 million working capital decreased by 158 million or
2 from december 31 2002 increases in receivables were driven by acquisitions
of

                                        29
page

332 million increases due to foreign currency fluctuations of 562 million
and increased sales activity inventory balances increases were driven by
acquisitions of 385 million increases due to foreign currency fluctuations of
321 million and decreases due to operational efforts to reduce inventory on
hand increases in accounts payable were driven by acquisitions of 127
million foreign currency fluctuations of 276 million and a concerted effort
by management to better align the payable cycle with the companys cash receipts
cycle

     other assets and deferred charges increased 406 million to 2081 million
at december 31 2003 increases were primarily due to increased prepaid pension
assets resulting from 485 million of contributions made during 2003

     at december 31 2003 the companys net property plant and equipment
amounted to 7179 million compared with 6762 million at the end of the
preceding year the increase in net property plant and equipment reflected
acquisitions of 640 million capital expenditures of 964 million and
increases related to foreign currency fluctuation of 265 million offset by
depreciation

     goodwill and intangible assets increased 2168 million and 1469 million
respectively increases were primarily driven by acquisitions which resulted in
goodwill of 1849 million and intangible assets of 1495 million and
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 689 million offset by
amortization

     the aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities
increased from 1520 million at the beginning of the year to 3308 million at
yearend this resulted primarily from the increase in deferrals related to
intangible assets the federal tax refund of 1515 million and increase in
taxable income during 2003

     current accrued expenses increased 660 million to 4468 million at
december 31 2003 increases during 2003 related to increased accrued
compensation and employee benefits of 207 million increased insurance
accruals of 192 million and increases in other accrued expenses of 262
million

     retained earnings increased from 31646 million at the beginning of 2003
to 33420 million at december 31 2003 the 1774 million increase resulted
from 2003 net earnings of 2929 million reduced by cash dividends which
aggregated 1155 million stockholders equity increased from 23948 million
to 27427 million the 3479 million increase resulted mainly from the
increase in retained earnings and increased equity adjustments related to
foreign currency translation of 1579 million

     dovers consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by 1009 million
in 2003 the increase was due principally to increases in actuarial losses
related to decreases in the discount rate in addition plan assets increased
762 million due to gains on plan investments during the year and contributions
of 485 million during 2003 plan amendments created an increase in the
benefit obligation of 270 million due to the decrease in the net funded
status of the plans and the amortization of unrecognized losses it is estimated
that pension expense will increase to approximately 161 million in 2004 the
company anticipates making discretionary contributions to its pension benefit
plans of 15 million to 25 million in 2004

     the company utilizes the total debt and net debt to total capitalization
calculations to assess its overall financial leverage and believes the
calculations are useful to its stakeholders for the same reasons the total debt
level of 10676 million as of december 31 2003 increased 135 million from
december 31 2002 as a result of drawing down approximately 400 million of
shortterm commercial paper partially offset by repayment of 264 million of
longterm debt as of december 31 2003 net debt of 6962 million represented
202 of total capital a decrease of 39 percentage points from december 31
2002 during 2003 dover borrowed 175 million in commercial paper to fund the
acquisition of warn which was then paid down in the same period with tax
refunds of approximately 1515 million

business strategy

since inception the company has operated with certain fundamental objectives
first it seeks to acquire and own businesses with proprietary engineered
industrial products which make them leaders in the niche markets which they
serve second these businesses must be customer focused innovative and well
managed to achieve above average profit margins by supplying customers with
value added products and related services third the company expects that these
types of businesses will generate strong cash flow which can not only sustain
such operations in terms of new product development and growth but also provide
excess cash flow which the company can then reinvest in new similar business
opportunities

the companys stated objectives are longterm earnings growth of 10 built on
businesses which can produce operating profits of 15 and generate a return on
capital of 25 these are goals the company strives to achieve it will not
necessarily be successful in every instance

to the extent the company is successful in its basic business strategy over
time it will generate operating cash flow which is sufficient to fund a large
part of its internal and external growth strategies as well as provide a return
to its shareholders in the form of modest annual cash dividends and long term
capital appreciation enhanced periodically by company stock repurchases

the company expects to manage its cash flow so that external debt levels and its
capital structure are optimized to support continued ready access to the capital
markets

management philosophy

the company practices a highly decentralized management style the presidents of
the operating companies are given a great deal of autonomy and have a high level
of independent responsibility for their businesses and their performance this
is in keeping with the companys operating philosophy that independent
operations are better able to serve customers by focusing closely on their
products and reacting quickly to customer needs the companys executive
management role is to provide management oversight allocate and manage capital
assist in major acquisitions evaluate motivate and as necessary replace
operating management and provide selected other services

acquisitions and divestitures

the company has a longstanding and successful acquisition program the company
seeks to acquire and develop platform businesses which are marked by growth
innovation and higher than average profit margins each of its businesses should
be a leader in its market as measured by market share customer service
innovation profitability and return on assets the company traditionally
focused on acquiring new businesses which could operate independently from other
dover companies standalones in addition over the last ten years
increased emphasis has been placed on acquiring businesses that can be added on
to existing operations addons the target companies are generally

manufacturers of high valueadded engineered products sold to a broad customer
base of industrial or commercial users one of the most critical factors in the
decision to acquire a business is the companys judgment of the skill energy
ethics and compatibility of the top executives at the acquisition target dover
expects that acquired companies will continue to be operated by the management
team in place at acquisition with a high degree of autonomy in keeping with the
companys decentralized structure from january 1 1998 through december 31
2002 the company made 74 acquisitions at a total acquisition cost of 20335
million in 2002 the company completed one standalone and five addon
acquisitions at a total cost of about 1008 million for more details regarding
acquisitions completed over the past two years see note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements in item 8 these acquisitions have had a substantial impact
on the companys sales and earnings since 1998

while the companys expects to buy and hold businesses it does periodically
reassess each business to verify that it continues to represent sound
stewardship for the shareholders there may also be situations where a company
business represents a very attractive acquisition for another company based on
specific market conditions based on these criteria the company has divested
businesses on occasion during the past two years the company has sold 8
companies for an aggregate consideration of 3766 million for more details

discontinued operations

in october of 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 sfas no
144 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the impairment and
disposal of longlived assets and discontinued operations the company elected
to early adopt sfas no 144 in 2001 the application of this statement results
in the classification and separate financial presentation of certain entities
as discontinued operations which are not included in continuing operations the
earnings loss from discontinued operations include charges to reduce these
businesses to estimated fair value less costs to sell fair value is determined
by using quoted market prices when available or other accepted valuation
techniques all interim and full year reporting periods have been restated to
reflect the discontinued operations discussed below

in 2002 the company concluded that several businesses either had limited growth
prospects under its ownership due to relevant domestic and international market
conditions or did not align with managements longterm strategic plans
accordingly four businesses were discontinued in technologies and three
businesses were discontinued in resources vectron gmbh from technologies and
tarby from resources were sold during 2002 for a net after tax loss of 45
million the remaining five businesses were classified as held for sale for the
year ended december 31 2002 one of those businesses wittemann in the
resources segment was subsequently sold in february of 2003 the company
expects to dispose of the rest of these businesses by the end of 2003

during 2001 the company discontinued four businesses in the diversified segment
and one business in both the industries and resources segments the company
determined that these businesses were not suited for longterm strategic growth
under its ownership the dovatech welding equipment business from industries and
the ac compressor business from diversified were sold during 2001 for a net gain
after tax of 966 million the four remaining businesses were classified as
held for sale as of december 31 2001 in 2002 all four of these businesses
were disposed of or liquidated for a net after tax gain of 36 million

during 2000 the company reported a 136 million loss after tax due to
subsequent adjustments to both the purchase price and expenses related to the
disposition of the dover elevator international market segment in 1999 these
results are reported in the gain loss on sale of discontinued operations net
of tax

                                    9 of 79

charges to reduce these discontinued businesses to their estimated fair values
have been recorded in earnings losses from discontinued operations net of
tax for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 charges were recorded to
write off goodwill of 316 million and 116 million and other longlived asset
impairments of 123 million and 77 million respectively

raw materials

dovers operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily
metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available
from a number of sources as a result shortages or the loss of any single
supplier have not had and are not likely to have a material impact on
operating profits during 2002 steel tariffs were imposed on the importation of
certain steel products which had a slight adverse impact on a number of dover
operating companies which use large amounts of steel

research and development

dovers operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to
upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand sales
opportunities maintain or extend competitive advantages improve product
reliability and reduce production costs during 2002 approximately 1685
million was spent on research and development compared with 1702 million and
1654 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively

for the dover technologies companies efforts in these areas tend to be
particularly significant because the rate of product development by their
customers is often quite high in general dover technologies companies that
provide electronic assembly equipment and services can anticipate that the
performance capabilities of such equipment are expected to improve significantly
over time with a concurrent expectation of lower operating costs and increasing
efficiency likewise dover technologies companies developing specialty
electronic components for the datacom and telecom commercial markets anticipate
a continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced cost such that
product life cycles generally average less than five years with meaningful sales
price reductions over that time period

dover industries dover resources and dover diversified contain many businesses
that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these
businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific
applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously
improving manufacturing processes none of these businesses experience the rate
of change in markets and products as are experienced generally by the dover
technologies companies

intellectual property

the company has a number of patents trademarks licenses and other forms of
intellectual property which have been acquired over a number of years and to
the extent relevant expire at various times over a number of years a large
portion of the companys intellectual property consists of confidential and
proprietary information constituting trade secrets that the company seeks to
protect in various ways including confidentiality agreements with employees and
suppliers where appropriate while the companys intellectual property is
important to its success the loss or expiration of any significant portion of
these rights would not materially affect the company or any of its segments the
company believes that its commitment to continuous engineering improvements new
product development and improved manufacturing techniques as well as strong
sales marketing and service efforts are significant to its general leadership
position in the niche markets that it serves

seasonality

in general dovers operations are not seasonal to any significant degree but
tend to have stronger revenues in the second and third quarters in particular
those companies serving the transportation construction waste hauling
petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets tend to be strong
during the second and third quarters companies serving the major equipment
markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries tend to
have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands which

customers

dovers businesses serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for
more than 10 of the companys consolidated revenues in 2002 within each of the
four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segments sales
in 2002

in the dover technologies segment the rapid growth in datacomtelecom
infrastructure market development during the period 19972000 involving both
equipment providers and software developers such as lucent motorola nortel
cisco siemens phillips and qualcomm tended to concentrate the new product
development and demand with relatively few customers at the same time a number
of these customers have outsourced a significant amount of their manufacturing
capability to electronic manufacturing services ems companies such as jabil
solectron celestica and flextronics which firms are now the direct customers
of dover technologies companies for a number of different oem customers given
the significant downturn in these markets since 2000 and the shift in
manufacturing this has tended to increase the concentration of manufacturing
with the emss companies particularly with those located in china hence
machine and specialty component demand is concentrated with a smaller number of
customers

in the other dover segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies
supplying the automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal
with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this
also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace
and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much
lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a
substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end
use applications

backlog

backlog generally is not a significant factor in most of dovers businesses as
most of dovers products have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is
more relevant to those businesses in the segments which produce larger and more
sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily in the
diversified segment as well as the heil companies from the industries segment
and the cbat and sec companies from the technologies segment total company
backlog as of december 31 2002 and 2001 was 6879 million and 7283 million
respectively

competition

dovers competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of
products manufactured and markets served in general most dover companies are
market leaders which compete with only a few companies and the key competitive
factors are customer service product quality and innovation in addition since
most of dovers manufacturing operations are in the united states dover usually
is a more significant competitor domestically than in foreign markets

in the dover technologies segment dover competes globally against a few very
large companies primarily operating in japan europe and the far east its
primary competitors are japanese producers including fuji machine panasonic
and tdk and european manufacturers like philips and siemens

within the other segments competition is primarily domestic although an
increasing number of dover companies see more international competitors and
several serve markets which are predominantly international particularly
belvac le quartzdyne rpa process technologies tipper tie tranter and
waukesha

international

for foreign sales export sales and an allocation of the assets of the companys
continuing operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in
item no 8 of this form 10k

although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price
and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign governmental restrictions dover
intends to increase its expansion into foreign markets including south america
far east and eastern europe

the countries where most of dovers foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are
based are france germany the uk the netherlands sweden and switzerland
and to a lesser extent china

environmental matters

dover believes its operations generally are in substantial compliance with
applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses
have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental
agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of
regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with
specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued

compliance will not have any material impact on the companys financial position
going forward and will not require significant capital expenditures

the facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for the operations
conducted during 2002 and 2001 excess capacity rapidly developed within the
technologies segment and to a much lesser degree within the other three
segments during the year 2002 steps were taken to reduce capacity where
appropriate



item 3  legal proceedings

a few of the companys subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating
to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state
statutes which provide for the allocation of such costs among potentially
responsible parties in each instance the extent of the companys liability
appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the
number of other potentially responsible parties involved and is anticipated to
be immaterial to the company in addition a few of the companys subsidiaries
are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain plant sites in
cooperation with regulatory agencies and appropriate reserves have been
established

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of
other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses management and legal
counsel periodically review the probable outcome of such proceedings the costs
and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred the availability and extent of
insurance coverage and established reserves while it is not possible at this
time to predict the outcome of these legal actions in the opinion of

management based on these reviews it is remote that the disposition of the
lawsuits and the other matters mentioned above will have a material adverse
effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

summary

dover corporation had net earnings from continuing operations for 2002 of 2111
million or 104 diluted earnings per share deps compared to 1818 million or
89 deps from continuing operations in 2001 earnings from continuing
operations net of tax included inventory restructuring and other charges of
253 million or 12 deps in 2002 and 526 million or 26 deps in 2001 for
2002 net earnings before changes in accounting principles were 1718 million
or 84 deps including 394 million or 20 deps in losses from discontinued
operations compared to 2485 million or 122 deps in 2001 which included
667 million or 33 deps in earnings from discontinued operations which was
primarily the result of gains from the sale of ac compressor and dovatech
businesses

for 2002 the net loss was 1213 million or 60 deps compared to earnings of
2485 million or 122 deps in 2001 2002 results include the impact of the
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and
other intangible assets sfas 142 the adoption resulted in a goodwill
impairment charge of 3451 million 2930 million net of tax or 144 deps
which was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the first quarter of 2002 the adoption of sfas 142 also included
the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill effective january 1 2002
goodwill amortization adjusted for discontinued operations totaled 422
million net of tax or 21 deps for 2001

sales for 2002 were 41837 million compared to 43684 million last year a
decrease of 4 gross profit of 13603 million for the year 2002 was down 2
compared to the prior years comparable amount of 13863 million this decline
was primarily due to the impact on dover technologies of the market contraction
in demand for its products serving the electronics industry at the same time
many of the industrial businesses in the other three operating segments were
negatively impacted by the slowdown in general economic activity however the
gross profit margin of 33 for 2002 compared favorably to 32 in 2001 operating
profit of 3416 million improved 7 compared to 3203 million in 2001 as a
percentage of sales operating profit in 2002 was 8 compared to 7 in 2001
comparisons to the prior year benefited from the discontinuation of goodwill
amortization in accordance with sfas no 142

segment earnings of 3654 million improved 2 from 3580 million in the prior
year diversifieds earnings of 1331 million improved 39 compared to the
prior year on a 7 sales increase to 11921 million in the industries segment
earnings increased 4 to 1476 million on a 3 sales decline to 11240
million resources earnings improved 1 to 1151 million on a 7 sales
decrease to 8374 million in the technologies segment a loss for 2002 of 303
million compared to 2001 earnings of 56 million and reflected a 13 sales
decline to 10365 million for 2002 diversified had margins of 11 up two
points and industries produced margins of 13 an improvement of one percentage
point resources margins improved one percentage point to 14 technologies
negative margins of 3 compared to breakeven margins in the prior year

dovers tax rate for continuing operations was 217 for 2002 and 298 in 2001
the lower effective tax rate in 2002 was attributable to three factors first
the company continued to benefit from tax credit programs such as r  d
foreign tax and the us export program which have been enhanced in the us
and various other jurisdictions over the past two years second the company
implemented a reorganization of various entities third the adverse impact
which market conditions have had on the company particularly in connection with
its adoption of sfas 142 has provided the company with the ability to identify
and recognize related tax benefits

interest expense of 700 million for the year ended 2002 was down 23 compared
to the prior year primarily due to lower levels of commercial paper borrowings
throughout 2002 interest income declined in 2002 compared to the prior year
which included 50 million related to a us federal tax settlement

all other net income or expense declined 209 million for 2002 compared to the
prior year total which included an insurance recovery of 64 million in the
diversified segment foreign exchange losses of 63 million for 2002 compared
to gains of 13 million in the prior year current year losses were due to
unfavorable exchange rate movements primarily involving the euro

restructuring and inventory charges
 
in 2002 the company initiated restructuring programs at selected operating
companies with ongoing efforts to reduce costs in the continually challenging
business environments in which the company operates the total restructuring
charges related to these programs in 2002 were 287 million the restructuring
charges included both employee separation costs of 119 million and costs
associated with exit activities of 168 million the restructuring in
technologies took place in the cbat and sec groups in response to the
significant declines in the endmarkets served by these operations

                                    16 of 79

of whom have been terminated as of december 31 2002 as a result of the
severance programs the company anticipates annual cost savings of approximately
25 to 35 million the company expects to complete the restructuring programs
undertaken in 2002 by the end of 2003 and the majority of the 2001 restructuring
programs were completed by december 31 2002

due to significant declines in the demand for certain products special
inventory reserves of 638 million were established in 2001 primarily in the
technologies segment and to a lesser degree in the diversified and resources
segments certain additions to these reserve balances were made in 2002 for
approximately 120 million in the technologies and diversified segments

dover diversified

dover diversifieds earnings increased 39 in 2002 to 1331 million on a 7
sales increase to 11921 million implementation of lean initiatives
operational improvements and cost reduction efforts helped the earnings
increase as well the absence of 181 million in restructuring inventory and
other charges taken in 2001 the impact of goodwill amortization on earnings for
the full year 2001 was 144 million segment profit margins improved to 11
from 9 a significant turnaround at crenlo strong earnings growth at hill
phoenix and pmi gains accounted for a large portion of the earnings
improvement which were somewhat offset by declines at swf le tranter mark
andy waukesha and sargent

hill phoenixs financial performance improved significantly in 2002 setting new
records in sales earnings and cash flow leading diversified in each of these
three categories this was accomplished through ongoing market share gain in
recent years and benefiting from their largest customers continuing expansion
programs market share improved to 18 in 2002 from 14 in 2001 this growth was
the result of being well positioned with the fastest growing customers as well
as securing new key accounts aggressive cost reduction initiatives at the
refrigeration division were a major contributor to the companys margin
improvement in 2002 hill phoenix enters 2003 looking forward to another
positive year as the capital programs of their core customer base are expected
to remain strong

tranter ended 2002 with a weak fourth quarter that left earnings and margins
below 2001 despite a record sales and bookings year tranter is highly
dependent on industrial capital spending which remained weak in 2002 after
years of stable margins the past two years have seen significant margin
erosion a soft us and european economy reduced total orders in the
marketplace and led to stronger price competition for the orders that were
available tranters markets are not expected to improve significantly in 2003
and cost reduction actions are planned to better handle periods of declining
prices and lower volumes tranters three business units swep tranter
radiator and tranter phe will report as independent operating companies of
diversified beginning in 2003

the increased focus on the medical automotive and military markets were not
enough to offset the continued major softness in the computer and industrial
electronics market segments although it appeared that a recovery was beginning
to take place in the spring of 2002 it became clear that this was not
sustainable for the remainder of 2002 accordingly the companies serving the
communications computer and industrial electronics industries began to resize
their companies for profitability at the sales levels they were experiencing
during the second half of the year by the end of the first quarter 2003 the
circuit board assembly and test cbat businesses and the specialty electronics
components sec businesses will have reduced their workforces by 15 and 13
respectively from the beginning of 2002 in addition where warranted the
companies have reduced their capacity needs to adapt to the current market
opportunities

the most significant change at substantially all of the cbat and sec companies
has been the geographic shift in their markets the year marked the continued
shift to asia with an emphasis on china for electronic manufacturing services
ems companies and china was the strongest of the telecommunications equipment
markets by the end of 2003 substantially all of the cbat companies will be
manufacturing in china either at their own facility or through subcontractors
where the strengths of the markets warrant the sec companies will have asian
based sales offices and in certain cases manufacturing facilities while the
american markets reflect stronger automotive medical and military
opportunities the asian and in particular china markets offer the best
opportunity for telecommunication equipment and electronic assembly growth in
the near term

the sec companies produce highly specialized often custom designed highend
components used in a wide variety of electronic devices during 2002 all of the
sec companies began to shift their focus from predominantly serving the wired
and wireless telecommunications industry to highreliability medical space
avionics and military applications though there is a greater mix of industries
served today the largest customer base still remains in the telecommunications
market much of the excess industry inventory built up during 2000 and early
2001 has been depleted however the telecom and datacom service providers are
still very cautious in their capital equipment spending as their business models
are changing and new federal telecommunications regulations are being developed
although it is starting to become apparent that the imbedded communications
infrastructure systems and equipment are showing the stresses of increased
capacity and lack of investment over the past 24 months it will be necessary
for the anticipated federal regulations to evolve and a rationalization of the
business model of these telecom service providers to occur before growth in
capital spending will resume the timing of this impact is unknown

reliability space and military positions

the capacitor companies novacap and dielectric saw continued decreases in
their sales as they both serve the telecommunications industries however
their specialty products have avionics military and medical applications which
are showing growth novacap and dielectric reported small losses mostly
attributable to writeoff of excess equipment

flat sales dowkey has a strong military and space program that continues to

critical accounting policies

the companys consolidated financial statements and related public financial
information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting
principles in the united states of america gaap gaap requires the use of
estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting
principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense
amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information
contained in the external disclosures of the company including information
regarding contingencies risk and its financial condition the company believes
its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and
are consistently and conservatively applied valuations based on estimates are
reviewed for reasonableness and conservatism on a consistent basis throughout
the company primary areas where financial information of dover is subject to
the use of estimates assumptions and the application of judgment include the
following

revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following circumstances are
satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists b price is fixed or
determinable c collectibility is reasonably assured and d delivery has
occurred in revenue transactions where installation is required revenue can be
recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the
functionality of the delivered products revenue transactions involving
nonessential installation obligations are those which can generally be
completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills
required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in
many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers if the
installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered
product revenues are deferred until installation is complete in a limited
number of revenue transactions other post shipment obligations such as training
and customer acceptance are required and accordingly revenues are deferred
until the customer is obligated to pay or acceptance has been confirmed
shipping and handling fees are not material and are generally credited to
revenue with related costs principally charged to cost of sales service
revenues are recognized and earned when services are performed and are not
significant to any period presented

allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating
companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on
historical losses adjusting for current economic conditions and in some cases
evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss the establishment of
reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential
for losses on receivable balances though dover considers these balances
adequate and proper changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which
the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required
in times of rapid market decline such as affected a number of dover
technologies companies in 2001 and 2002 reserve balances needed to be adjusted
in response to these unusual circumstances

inventory for the majority of the companys subsidiaries including all
international subsidiaries and the dover technologies segment are stated at the
lower of cost determined on the firstin firstout fifo basis or market
other domestic inventory is stated at cost determined on the lastin firstout
lifo basis which is less than market value under certain market conditions
estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the
company to properly value inventory dover technologies companies tend to
experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations particularly given the
relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of
time

during the year the company established restructuring reserves at a number of
operations these reserves for both severance and exit costs required the use
of estimates though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the
costs of these plans actual results may be different than the estimated
amounts

dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that
include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions the valuation
and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and
amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates the
testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines including
the recently adopted sfas no 142 for impairment also requires significant use
of judgment and assumptions dovers assets are tested and reviewed for
impairment on an annual basis changes in business conditions could potentially
require future adjustments to these valuations

the valuation of dovers pension and other postretirement plans requires the
use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations
of expenses and assetsliabilities these assumptions include discount rates
investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality
rates the actuarial assumptions used in dovers pension reporting are reviewed
annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately
account for dovers future pension obligations changes in assumptions and

dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for
recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using
estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning
strategies reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal
state and international issues that are currently unresolved the company
routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it
is properly reserved valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be
impacted by changes to tax codes and rulings changes in statutory tax rates and
the companys future taxable income levels

dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management
program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment in regards to
risk exposure and ultimate liability the company estimates losses under these
programs using actuarial assumptions dover experience and relevant industry
data dover considers the current level of accrual and reserves adequately
valued relative to current market conditions and company experience

dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both
the operating company and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and
use of estimates is required to quantify dovers ultimate exposure in these
matters the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly
basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is properly
reserved reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances
for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging
issues while dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate
changes in the future could impact these determinations

the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various
reasons estimates are used to properly restate the assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell these
estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result
of the sale changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an
operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates

liquidity and capital resources

management assesses the companys liquidity in terms of its ability to generate
cash to fund its operating investing and financing activities significant
factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities
capital expenditures acquisitions dividends stock repurchases adequacy of
available bank lines of credit and the ability to attract longterm capital with
satisfactory terms

cash flows from continuing operations



               in thousands                       2002          2001

cash flows used in financing activities         140299    545006


the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2001 of 2884
million is primarily due to lower decreases in accounts receivable and
inventories which provided cash of 3141 million in 2001 as compared to only
1010 million in 2002 in addition a large estimated 2001 federal tax payment
of approximately 400 million was made in 2002 and a discretionary 440
million cash contribution was made to the companys pension plans lastly cash
outflows associated with restructuring and exit costs also decreased operating
cash flows

cash used in investing activities decreased 2385 million in 2002 as compared
to 2001 capital expenditures decreased 603 million to 1023 million
reflecting reduced need capital expenditures for 2003 are budgeted to be
approximately 150 million but the company expects the actual level to be lower
and will internally finance these capital expenditures during 2002 the company
invested on a net economic basis defined as the gaap purchase price adjusted
for debt assumed and cash acquired 1001 million in acquisitions as compared
to 2818 million in 2001 which is a decrease of 1817 million or 64
acquisition activity in 2003 is expected to approach 2001 levels but is largely
dependent upon the availability of appropriate acquisition candidates

cash used in financing activities was primarily for the cash dividends paid to
stockholders of 1094 million the repurchase of 511400 shares of treasury
stock at an average price of 2745 for 140 million and finally the repayment
of commercial paper borrowings offset by 84 million in proceeds from the
termination of two interest rate swap agreements the principal cause for the
decrease of 4047 million in 2002 for cash used in financing activities was due

under the terms of the two new revolving credit agreements dated october 2002
which replaced the old revolving credit agreement dated november 2001 the
company has 600 million of bank credit availability the arrangements include a
300 million 364day facility and a 300 million 3year facility the new
364day facility bears interest at libor plus 23 and the new 3year facility
bears interest at libor plus 21 the key financial covenant of these
facilities requires the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda
to net interest expense of not less than 35 to 1 the company has been in
compliance with the covenant and the ratio was 78 to 1 as of december 31 2002
this credit facility was unused during 2002 under the terms of the old
revolving credit agreement dated november 2001 the company had 750 million of
bank credit availability this credit facility was unused during 2001 the
company chose to decrease the aggregate amount of its revolving credit facility
from 750 million to 600 million due to the anticipated reduced need for
shortterm financing the company intends to replace the 300 million 364day
credit facility on or before its expiration date of october 17 2003 at
equivalent market rates the company established a new canadian credit facility
in november of 2002 under the terms of this credit agreement the company has a
canadian cad 30 million bank credit availability and has the option to borrow
in either canadian dollars or us dollars at december 31 2002 the
outstanding borrowings under this facility were 163 million in us dollars
the covenants and interest rates under this facility match those of the primary
600 million revolving credit facilities the canadian credit facility expires
on november 25 2003 the company intends to replace the canadian credit
facility on or before its expiration date at comparable market rates the
primary purpose of these agreements is to act as an alternative for short term
financing in the event of a disruption in the commercial paper market which the
company normally accesses for its short term borrowing needs

the company may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to
manage its exposure to interest rate changes interest rate swaps are agreements
to exchange fixed and variable rate payments based on the notional principal
amounts as of december 31 2001 the company had two interest rate swap
agreements terminating on november 15 2005 with a total notional amount of 150
million to exchange fixed rate interest for variable both swaps were designated
as fair value hedges of the 250 million notes due november 15 2005 and the
net interest payments or receipts from these agreements during 2001 were
recorded as adjustments to interest expense there was no hedge ineffectiveness
as of december 31 2001 and the fair value of the interest rate swaps determined
through market quotation of 05 million was reported in other assets and
longterm debt during 2002 both of the interest rate swaps were settled which
resulted in net gains of 84 million these gains were deferred and are being
amortized over the balance of the term of the debt permanently reducing the
effective interest rate of the 250 million notes due november 15 2005 from
65 to 53

in 2000 the company filed a shelf registration for the issuance of up to 1
billion in senior debt securities and on february 12 2001 issued 4000 million
of 650 notes due february 15 2011 under this registration the proceeds were
used to reduce shortterm commercial paper borrowings under the shelf
registration up to 6000 million of debt securities could be issued currently
if such financing was required

management is not aware of any potential impairment to the companys liquidity
and the company was in compliance with all its longterm debt covenants it is
anticipated that in 2003 any funding requirements above cash generated from
operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or depending
upon market conditions through the issuance of longterm debt or some
combination of the two

in 2002 accounts receivable increased 60 million to 6699 million
inventories decreased 439 million to 5951 million and accounts payable
decreased 24 million to 1996 million decreased inventory levels resulted
from declining volumes and reserves recorded in 2002 of approximately 120
million to state inventory at the lower of cost or market primarily in the
technology segment

at december 31 2002 the companys net property plant and equipment amounted
to 7049 million compared with 7382 million at the end of the preceding year
goodwill decreased 2532 million as a result of the impairment recorded for
3451 million upon adoption of sfas 142 offset by goodwill from acquisitions of
431 million and the cumulative translation adjustment and other adjustments
for 489 million intangible assets net of amortization increased 316
million during 2002 principally as a result of acquisitions

the aggregate of current and deferred income tax liabilities decreased from
2223 million at the beginning of the year to 1546 million at yearend this
decrease resulted primarily from the payments of amounts related to extensions
granted for 2001 us estimated tax payments in 2002

retained earnings decreased from 33952 million at the beginning of 2002 to
31646 million at december 31 2002 the 2307 million decrease resulted from
2002 net losses of 1213 million and cash dividends which aggregated 1094
million stockholders equity decreased from 25193 million to 23946
million the 1247 million decrease resulted mainly from the 2307 million
decrease in retained earnings and treasury stock purchases of 140 million
reduced by equity adjustments related to foreign currency fluctuations of 1113
million

dovers consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by 171 million in
2002 the increase was due principally to increases in actuarial losses in
addition plan assets decreased 160 million due to losses sustained on plan
investments during the year partially offset by contributions of 440 million
due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans it is estimated that
pension expense will increase approximately 7 million in 2003 the company
anticipates having to contribute to its pension benefit plans in 2003 between
25 million and 45 million

the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet
anticipated funding needs at comparable riskbased interest rates for the
foreseeable future acquisition spending would increase company debt but
management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally
consistent with historical levels operating cash flow and access to capital
markets are expected to satisfy the companys various cash flow requirements
including acquisition spending and pension funding as needed

summary

in 2001 dover corporation sales declined 14 from 2000 to 43684 million
this decline was primarily due to the dramatic impact on dover technologies of
the market contraction in demand for its products serving the electronics
industry all of the dover technologies businesses were impacted at the same
time many of the industrial businesses in the other three operating segments
were negatively impacted by the slowdown in general economic activity

as a result segment income from continuing operations totaled 3580 million in
2001 a decline of 58 from 2000 record earnings of 3848 million in
technologies in 2000 a boom year dropped to 56 million in 2001
industries earnings of 1910 million in 2000 declined 26 to 1422 million
in 2001 the result of weak markets for most companies diversifieds earnings
declined 36 from 1506 million in 2000 to 959 million in 2001 largely due
to operational problems at crenlo but also due to weak markets for several
businesses dover resources earnings declined 6 from 1214 million in 2000 to

1142 million in 2001 as strength in oil and gas related businesses until late
in the year were offset by weakness in industrial markets

as the result of unexpectedly weak market conditions efforts were made
throughout the year and more intensively as the year progressed to
rightsize by reducing employment levels eliminating costs and restructuring
operations

dover diversified

dover diversifieds sales increased 9 in 2001 to 11183 million but earnings
declined 36 to 959 million continuing earnings were reduced 181 million by
charges for restructurings inventory accounts receivable and other reserves
before these charges earnings were down 24 segment profit margins declined to
9 from 15 a substantial amount of the decline in earnings related to crenlo
where strong earnings in 2000 became a significant loss in 2001 this along
with earnings declines at tranter mark andy and swf caused by difficult market
conditions offset gains at hill phoenix sargent waukesha and performance
motorsports

hill phoenixs sales increased dramatically setting a new record in 2001
easily retaining its number one sales position within diversified this was
accomplished in a market that declined about 7 during the year hill phoenixs
2001 market share gain should establish it as the strong number two company in
its highly competitive marketplace market share growth was a function both of
being well positioned with the fastest growing customers and of penetrating new
key accounts some of these are the large discount chains that are becoming
larger competitors of the supermarket operators bookings grew and backlog
increased all through the year until the fourth quarter when some spending
commitments were delayed into the coming year earnings were also sharply
higher as margins were maintained both sales and earnings were helped to a
degree by the contribution of national cooler a walkin cooler case business
acquired in september 2000 in an effort to broaden the product line which was
successfully integrated into hill phoenix operations

in a year when the competitive landscape was marked by consolidation
particularly in the supermarket industry the stability and experience of the
hill phoenix management team and the perceived technical superiority of its
product line both contributed to growth in market share

tranter one of diversifieds largest businesses again captured the distinction
of being its largest profit contributor despite significant erosion in profit
margin tranters trend of steady growth and high stable margins was broken in
a very challenging 2001 tranter is highly dependent on industrial capital
spending one of the weakest sectors of the economy in addition the strength
of the us dollar gave foreignbased competitors an advantage in the us
radiator market and price competition was severe also because of us dollar
strength the profitability of tranters foreign operations was lower when
translated from local currency some plant inefficiencies and temporary product
line gaps also contributed to the shortfall in earnings

crenlo had a very disappointing year as a variety of postacquisition
management challenges were further complicated by a weak market for which it was
not well prepared this led to a substantial loss for 2001 in contrast to a
highly profitable 2000 the first year after acquisition throughout 2000
crenlo had focused on growing sales by providing a cost effective quality
source of cab enclosures to customers who had often manufactured these
internally during the same period the market for its electronics enclosures
product line was growing dramatically with the electronics market generally a
decision to build a second large fully integrated plant for cabs was made in
early 2000 and by mid2001 the plant was complete

in early 2001 it became apparent that during this growthoriented period not
only had internal controls over inventory begun to suffer but also product
costs had risen and pricing had eroded while fixed costs had risen substantially
faster than the business was growing a new president was installed and he began
the process of dealing with internal controls and aligning the cost structure
more closely to the existing order intake levels

as the year progressed all served markets began to slow down and then late in
the year contract rapidly costs added from the new plant added complexity to
the management challenge new managements improvement initiatives were unable
to keep pace with the declining market and losses continued the focus is on
customer satisfaction through ontime delivery quality and value and on
regaining crenlos historically stable profit profile

sargents 2001 sales adjusted for operations discontinued in the fourth
quarter were up sharply due to a strong backlog at the beginning of the year
and stable conditions in both the aerospace and marine markets for much of the
year however with the weakening of market conditions after the september 11th
terrorist attacks aerospace order intake particularly in the profitable
aftermarket segment of the business declined precipitously along with airline

                                    29 of 79

traffic earnings for the year were also up to record levels as margins
remained stable despite heavy investment in new regional jet and marine product
development programs

at the end of the year the airtomic business which had been part of c lee
cook in the dover resources segment was transferred to sargent because of very
strong synergies in the aerospace aftermarket repair and overhaul sector the
incremental sales will roughly replace those of the discontinued operations but
with much higher margins investment in new aerospace programs and in developing
new aftermarket service capabilities will continue

mark andys printing markets were weak throughout 2001 leading to a substantial
drop in profitability sales were higher due to the acquisition of comco at the
end of march but its sales and profitability were substantially below
expectations as well as a result of the weak market the integration of comco
was accelerated with more cost cutting at both facilities than had been
originally planned significant reductions in employment and plant
consolidations helped at both businesses but these actions were not able to
restore margins mark andy also consolidated facilities at its graphics
microsystems business with the cost reductions completed todate a renewed
emphasis on marketing and new product development and continued focus on
gaining efficiencies mark andy is wellpositioned for an improvement in the
market but significant improvement in profitability will likely await better
market conditions

waukesha bearings set an earnings record in 2001 on sharply higher sales this
was driven primarily by continued strength in demand for its large bearing
products from the gas turbine market demand for electrical power generation
capacity was particularly strong and bookings and backlog remained at high
levels throughout the year however the likely duration of this markets boom
period which had been expected to continue for at least a few more years has
recently been questioned with the decline in electrical usage in the economic
downturn relative to capacity recently added waukeshas geographic
penetration technical capabilities and product offerings were substantially
improved with the third quarter acquisition of federal mogul rpb a uk based
bearing manufacturing company this acquisition makes waukesha the clear market
leader in its niche

performance motorsports inc pmi had a much stronger sales and earnings
performance in 2001 than it did in the prior year and a record performance on
both metrics with consistently high margins though this was helped by
acquisitions of the carillo and perfect bore businesses in the second half the
core business also performed well for most of the year some market weakness was
evident in the fourth quarter performance improvements were primarily due to
investments in manufacturing efficiency and technical capabilities tangible
improvements in throughput quality and cost reduction were also due to a
successful focus on lean manufacturing tools and techniques the recent
acquisitions though small have also helped position pmi well in its markets
through improved geographic coverage manufacturing synergies and a broader
array of technical capabilities for each of its market segments

swfs sales increased substantially in 2001 largely due to the full year impact
of acquisitions made in 2000 and the contribution of acquisitions made early in
2001 however earnings declined for two reasons externally the market for
swfs packaging machine products was down an estimated 20 in this environment
swf was able to maintain market share internally the management complexity of
the acquisition integration process caused some slippage in focus on customers
and product cost improved internal processes and the renewed focus on product
improvement and internal cost control should help improve margins regardless of
market conditions

belvacs position as the only remaining independent supplier of can forming
equipment ties its fortunes to the capital spending cycles and sourcing
preferences of its customers some of whom have competing inhouse capabilities
belvac is now structured to perform well even in the cyclical troughs in this
market thus the weak market experienced in 2001 resulted in a meaningful sales
decline but a more modest profit decline enhancing its profile as a strong cash
flow contributor

in 2001 langbein  engelbrachts sales increased modestly however earnings
were flat as competitive pricing pressures held margins down improved market
segmentation investment in sales coverage focus on higher first pass yield
and project bidding with complementary suppliers may lead to more opportunities
but anemic economic growth in europe will be a limiting factor

dover industries

dover industries sales in 2001 declined 4 to 11601 million as general
weakness in its industrial and commercial markets impacted most of its

after heil environmentals strongest earning year in its history in 2000 market
conditions entering 2001 outside of large municipal markets such as new york
city were showing signs of softness as the year progressed all the negative
factors which can make this business cyclical such as capital spending
constraints at the large waste haulage companies higher fuel costs and the
impact of economic uncertainty on spending plans particularly by the
independent smaller operators were in evidence the loss of a major portion of
one large customers business during the first quarter compounded this problem
as did a slow down in product acceptance in new york city after september 11th
these factors led results for the year to fall below those of the prior two
years both of which were new records at the time nonetheless 2001 represented
the third best year in company history and though margins declined they
remained significantly above the average for all industries companies

heil environmental has responded with programs for lowering product cost both
through product redesign and lean manufacturing initiatives

marathon influenced by many of the same industry dynamics was plagued not only
by a very weak market but also by fierce competition from a heavily leveraged
competitor liquidating inventory at low prices marathon has a much broader
range of product capability than any of its competitors and can adapt more
readily in such a marketand it did receive important new business with large
national waste haulage and chain store accounts however marathon typically
operates with relatively low backlogs and the weak economy particularly since
the fourth quarter has led the company to focus on internal cost containment
programs to maintain its still above average margin levels

for rotary lift long one of industries largest earnings contributors and
increasingly so 2001 was both a very challenging and successful year the
market for automotive lifts was down 12 after a smaller decline the prior
year however rotarys sales in 2001 were flat with the prior year and it
further improved its leading market share position rotary successfully
continued its track record of using cost reduction to drive price
competitiveness in the market while maintaining margins rotary was also able
to solidify its position by developing a new product inbaytm having the
most technologically advanced product has helped grow market share particularly
with larger accounts such as the large auto repair chains

heil trailer one of industries largest companies measured by sales endured
its second straight year of doubledigit percentage earnings declines which in
turn followed a year of flat earnings because of the continuing recession in
its markets capital spending programs at the major oil companies for petroleum
tankers have been hurt by the wave of industry consolidations and the market for
dry bulk trailers has remained very weak a pickup in military orders
particularly at the recently acquired kalynsiebert business helped later in
the year

the decline in the market has intensified competitive pricing pressure heil has
responded with new products such as safer low profile petroleum tanker
trailers and a repeatedly demonstrated commitment to cost reductions heil has
thus been able to stabilize margins albeit at much lower than traditional
levels late in the year heil suffered currency losses in its argentine
operation due to that countrys currency crisis but the other small operations
in the uk and thailand both showed improved performance heil trailers
ability to address global oil companies international product and service needs
is a distinct competitive advantage

texas hydraulics historical growth in sales and earnings with very strong
margins has been driven by a product differentiation strategy to provide
engineered solutions to customers hydraulic cylinder needs however in 2001
all served markets were down substantially particularly in texas hydraulics
important aerial lift and utility platform markets this trend began in 2000 and
was driven by consolidation in the rental equipment endmarkets for these
applications it resulted in a substantial decline in sales and earnings but a
more modest margin deterioration texas hydraulics has responded by
reemphasizing penetration in other endmarkets through new products and new
designs but price competition has been fierce due to excess industry capacity
thus significant investment has been made in lean manufacturing tools and
techniques leading to higher quality quicker response time to customers and
lower labor and material cost

pdq which joined dover in mid1998 turned in yet another full year of
substantial sales and earnings growth based on its continued penetration of the
vehicle wash equipment market with its innovative touchless products pdqs
success is based on successful new market introductions close attention to
competitive pricing and continual cost reductions

tipper tie struggled in 2001 with both internal and external problems that led
to flat sales and lower margins early in the year demand for capital equipment
from meat processors was severely reduced by the mad cow and hoof and mouth
disease scares particularly in europe where roughly 50 of tipper ties sales
are generated though this effect dissipated as the year progressed margins for
new equipment came under pressure as the soft market caused fierce competition
intense price competition was also seen in the clip market miscues in product

introductions further depressed earnings entering 2002 cost reductions
particularly in the us the introduction of proven european products into
the us market and new clip designs are the focus of tipper ties still new
management team

triton which was acquired in early 2000 has underperformed initial
expectations and 2001 was a particularly difficult year sales were flat but
profits were a fraction of the prior year adverse external factors included an
industry upheaval caused by the rapid rise and then decline to bankruptcy of
credit card center ccc an independent sales organization that flooded the
market with competitors product this resulted in a market overloaded with a
great many unused atm machines when cccs business model proved unviable that
overhang which has not been fully absorbed by early 2002 is further
complicated by slowing domestic market growth and resultant price competition
internally triton has struggled with delayed new product development and
introductions as well as manufacturing inefficiencies in the fourth quarter of
2001 triton executed a major staff reduction realigned the management
structure in marketing and manufacturing and reinvigorated the product
pipeline

somero acquired in mid1999 has also failed to meet initial expectations and
sales and earnings have declined significantly since acquisition the somero
market niche is small and narrow and its construction markets remain depressed

chief automotive has been challenged for three years by the sluggish growth of a
maturing market chief has responded by focusing on new product introductions
and marketing programs geared to induce customers to trade up to new highend
products sales and earnings declined in 2001 but chief is maintaining market
leadership and high returns on operating investment

groens institutional food service equipment market declined in 2001
particularly in the fourth quarter causing groens sales and earnings to also
decline a new management team has reinvigorated product development and has
begun introducing product line extensions and variations and has a new cost
conscious business model to grow margins and cash flow

randells market concentrated in the restaurant chains has grown for a number
of years as the percentage of meals eaten away from home increased however
this trend may have slowed the market increasingly competitive now depends
more on renovations and less on new construction for 2001 these trends were
amplified in the weak economic environment and margins suffered in 2002
randell expects to renew its focus on new product development as a strategy to
gain share and on operational improvements for competitiveness and margin
recovery

after the sale of its main line welding products business in april of 2001
dovatechs remaining laser and laser cooler business was hit hard by the
economic downturn particularly in solidstate applications for the
telecommunications industry machine tool customers also slowed orders as the
year progressed

dover resources

dover resources sales in 2001 increased 6 to a record 8974 million largely
due to strength in the oil and gas production markets served by petroleum
equipment group c lee cook and quartzdyne and due to the full year impact of
addon acquisitions in 2000 earnings of 1142 million in 2001 were reduced by
71 million in charges for restructurings inventory and other reserves
without those charges earnings would have been slightly higher than the prior
year operating profit margins declined from 14 in 2000 to 13 in 2001 as very
difficult conditions in the automotive and transportation markets impacted
several dover resources companies

petroleum equipment groups peg 2001 sales and earnings were both about 20
higher than in 2000 reaching a modern record post early 1980s boom period
through the first half of the year demand was strong in the oil and gas
production markets served and across all product lines but particularly for
sucker rods used in oil production after midyear these markets weakened
considerably and by the end of 2001 pegs results were comparable to the same
period in 2000 significant investments in production capabilities and business
streamlining initiatives since 1998 have resulted in lower product costs
improved flexibility and reduced cycle times these initiatives have also helped
peg further increase its market penetration

lower oil prices discouraged new drilling as the year progressed declining
natural gas prices also reduced spending by natural gas producers however all
peg units were able to maintain solid profitability even while demand was
weakening norriseal has been able to regain market share for its valves and
controls through enhanced customer service norris and aot have been successful
with their sucker rod guide initiatives and fergusonbeauregards plunger lift
product line achieved solid success with its new initiative to provide complete
control systems to natural gas producers

c lee cooks record sales and earnings results in 2001 reflected strong demand
from the natural gas production and distribution customers both oem and
aftermarket for its gas compressor components cooks recent investments in
improved manufacturing processes increased capacity new products product line
extensions and strong results from the service and repair operations at its
compressor components unit contributed to the companys ability to capitalize on
the strong market the demand for increased natural gas production evident
earlier in 2001 has waned as new production has become available and demand and
prices declined in a weaker economy as a result c lee cooks sales in the oem
segment of the market will likely decline in 2002 with some possible offset
from increased emphasis on aftermarket sales of components and services new
product initiatives and increased penetration in international markets

quartzdyne also had record sales and earnings in 2001 as high oil prices
spurred new oil well drilling and completions in the first half of the year a
result of product development initiatives quartzdynes ruggedized pressure
transducer product line utilizing enhanced quartz pressure sensor technology
and hybrid circuit designs is being increasingly used in measurement while
drilling permanent pressure measurement and intelligent completions

in 2001 opw fueling components managed a modest sales increase and maintained
flat earnings and margins in a challenging market new service station
construction activity has continued to be slow as pricing pressure on the major
oil companies and convenience store chains have curtailed investment the only
source of significant new retail station growth has been in the hypermarket
segment industry consolidation at all levels of the market  oil companies
distributors and competitors  has been a dampening factor but has left the
company in a comparatively favorable position because of its strong product line
and global reach replacement demand for opw fueling components broad product
line of gasoline nozzles and other service station devices has been more stable
success continues with the piscestm line of underground secondary containment
systems and with petro vends automated fuel management systems opw fueling
components investment for its new line of enhanced vapor recovery products
positions it well as environmental compliance expectations increase in all
markets

in 2001 opw fluid transfer group suffered from continued weakness in its
petroleum dry bulk chemical and petrochemical transportationrelated
businesses the benefits of a major business restructuring initiative undertaken
in 1999 which boosted 2000s results also helped maintain respectable margins
in 2001 nevertheless further cost reductions and restructuring actions were
undertaken during the year opw fluid transfer groups focus in 2002 will be to
maintain margins in a weak market as it continues new product development and
customer service initiatives in order to benefit from substantial positive
operating leverage when transportation markets recover

as a result of internal and operational improvements better results from its
international sales channels and successful introduction of a complete line of
plastic bolted pumps wilden has maintained solid operational profitability in
spite of the generally weak industrial and process industry markets it serves

blackmer experienced a significant profit improvement in 2001 as higher
european sales and a more pronounced increase in european margins resulted from
the streamlining actions initiated in 2000 with the exception of
governmentrelated sales most of blackmers other served markets  industrial
petroleum chemical and petrochemical and transportationrelated  were
generally weaker than the prior year

the full year impact of acquisitions at tulsa winch group led to record sales
and earnings in the early part of the year tulsa winch benefited from strong
demand from its oem customer base and a very strong market for its oil field
winch product line as the year progressed the oil field related market
weakened and sales to its oem market slowed dramatically further progress is
expected in 2002 in achieving synergistic benefits from the four previously
independent companies that now comprise the tulsa winch group in the weak
market expected in 2002 these operational improvements and a more focused
product offering will help position the company well for market recovery

destaco industries was challenged in 2001 by low general industrial market
demand for its clamping and workplace automation products particularly because
of its sales concentration in the domestic automotive industry this decline in
enduser demand was made more pronounced by inventory reduction in distribution
channels international markets were also weak made worse by the strong us
dollar sales of robotic equipment in the electronics assembly market also
declined severely the result was a slump in profitability and margin decline
destaco industries has responded with numerous rightsizing actions and a
focus on factory productivity solutions this effort was boosted by the
acquisition of cpi end of robot arm devices at the beginning of the year with
further market declines expected destaco industries will accelerate market
penetration efforts and continue tight cost control measures to hold
profitability until economic conditions improve

in 2001 destaco manufacturing maintained profits by reducing costs in the
face of severe margin pressure from its automotive customer base and at the end
of the year finalized plans to exit an underperforming business segment in

2002 destaco manufacturing will focus on its core compressor reed valve and
ride control disc customers with a muchreduced cost structure

rpa process technologies rpa had significant improvements in both sales and
operating profit as its european unit recovered from a very poor performance in
2000 the year it was acquired capital spending in rpas markets particularly
in the paper industry was weak throughout 2001 and entering 2002 there are few
signs of nearterm recovery in the global process industry markets that rpa
serves

hydro systems had a record year for both sales and earnings as a result of
success with new product and market initiatives and progress with cost reduction
efforts the institutional and industrial cleaning market served by hydro
systems has proven to be relatively recession resistant although some market
weakness is being experienced as hydro systems enters 2002

the global market for carbon dioxide generation and recovery equipment supplied
by wittemann remains quite depressed and although duncan had another difficult
year in 2001 improved performance in the second half resulted from a reduced
cost structure and increased customer focus

dover technologies

dover technologies sales in 2001 declined 40 from the prior year to 11981
million due to the wellchronicled collapse of the technology sector
technologies reported earnings of 56 million after 433 million in charges
for restructurings inventory and other reserves following record earnings of
3848 million in 2000 the unprecedented boom year for the electronics
manufacturing market the lack of endmarket demand for electronics equipment
caused technologies circuit board assembly and test cbat businesses
customers to dramatically curtail spending for its predominantly capital
equipment products cbat sales declined 53 to 6471 million and record 2000
earnings of 2715 million were transformed to a 528 million loss
technologies specialty electronics components sec businesses were similarly
affected particularly given their product focus on the higher technology data
communications telecommunications and networking markets sec sales declined
27 to 3416 million and record earnings in 2000 of 1090 million dropped to
456 million imaje the french based industrial inkjet printer manufacturer
had another very successful year

cbat
universal instruments experienced the largest percentage sales decline from the
prior year in this group of companies a decline so large that universal is no
longer dovers largest company and went from record profits to a sizable loss 
indeed universal accounted for the majority of the loss at cbat universals
high end products were particularly hard hit as large electronic manufacturing
services ems and oem customers stopped adding capacity a similar thing
occurred at universals alphasem subsidiary when semiconductor assembly
customers stopped expanding

dek whose increasingly well positioned broad line of circuit board screen
printers had a smaller sales decline as they also have lower priced products
that appeal to customers that were not as hard hit by the downturn vitronics
soltec had a lower rate of decline than either universal or dek as its
comprehensive range of soldering machines improved their competitive position
dek and vitronics soltec both have a strong european base which trailed the
us in the downturn and both companies managed to generate a modest level of
profitability

everett charles technologies sales in 2001 declined less dramatically because
some of their products are not capital equipment and they acquired multitest at
midyear contact spring probes for instance are not a capital item and demand
depends more on its customers production volumes and new product introduction
in electronics endmarkets however these markets which were also slow in 2001
the portion of the business serving the semiconductor test market including
multitest though well positioned competitively saw demand decline to
unanticipated low levels creating an overall loss

ok international acquired in late 2000 experienced a sales decline similar to
dek and vitronics soltec and reported a small loss in 2001 oks products are
generally shorterlived tools or consumables thus ok also depends largely on
customers production levels which were declining entering 2001 and remained at
depressed levels all year this condition persists

entering 2001 customer demand for the large machines used in circuit board
production which had increasingly been centered with the large ems customers
had already begun to evaporate and backlog was little more than half of what it
had been at the market peak six months earlier as bookings and backlog
continued to decline losses mounted peaking in the third quarter in the
fourth quarter with some relative stability in demand albeit at depressed
levels together with the early benefits of substantial cost reductions losses
began to diminish the reaction to the dramatic downturn was to rightsize the
business by reducing employment and eliminating all but critical operating

expenses at universal for instance near the end of 2001 a complete
organizational restructuring accompanied the third major employment reduction
for the year

at the end of the year most remaining demand for larger machines was from
smaller ems companies and some oems demands for replacement parts to service
the installed base remanufactured machines other types of assembly machines
and throughhole placement equipment were all also down substantially though
not as dramatically as in the core surfacemount businesses at year end the
group was still below the breakeven point

throughout cbat product development critical for longterm market leadership in
this still attractive market was maintained albeit under close cost benefit
scrutiny universal has recently introduced a new product the all linear motor
gsmb which sets new standards in flexible fine pitch applications a market
segment requiring both high speed and extreme placement accuracy universals
now selfsufficient alphasem offspring also introduced a new product the
leading diesorter and die bonder suitable for the new 300 millimeter wafer
technology expected to become predominant in semiconductor manufacturing at
dek continued new product development and introduction in the traditional
circuit board market are now also being supplemented by wafer bumping and
ball attach applications for semiconductor manufacturers vitronics soltecs
new offerings range from redesigned machines for lowerend applications to
entirely new technologies for selective soldering suitable for mixed
component attachment applications

sec
the sec companies all produce highly specialized often custom designed
highend components used in a wide variety of electronic devices the largest
served market is the telecommunications industryboth wired and
wirelessprimarily for infrastructure applications this market experienced a
rapid rampup through 2000 entering 2001 backlogs were still high and much of
the customer base remained optimistic that they could maintain reasonable volume
levels however order intake and market optimism dropped precipitously in the
first quarter of 2001 and backlog declined all year in the wired
infrastructure endmarket secs customers were hurt as the collapse of the
dotcom bubble left the market glutted with unused equipment and demand from
endcustomers could not support the existing expanded capacity in the wireless
market the much anticipated boom in new markets and applications such as 3g
failed to materialize and the high cost of frequency licenses followed by a
contraction of capital availability caused many carriers to restrict or
eliminate spending demand in end markets for access devices cable and dsl
modems telephones and the like also slowed sharply

in many cases secs customers were left with excess component inventory
causing not only low demand but also cancellations of prior orders in other
cases customers new product launches critical to secs leading technology
orientation were curtailed other markets for sec representing roughly one
third of sales include the high reliabilityoriented military satellite
aerospace and industrial markets the sec companies saw modest growth in these
markets in 2001 as evidenced by the improved earnings at dowkey microwave

sec was somewhat cushioned by its geographic profile as the market slowdown
spread from the us to europe and then asia novacap in particular which
acquired likesized ukbased syfer in 2000 with complementary technologies
and customers benefited from syfers relatively stronger demand through the
first half of the year

each sec company has responded by significantly reducing headcount restricting
unnecessary spending and lowering product cost dt magnetics for instance
aggressively restructured its business by downsizing higher cost us operations
and expanding off shore manufacturingin this case in the dominican republic
k  l microwave and quadrant both moved aggressively to expand business
opportunities in china the focus on china sourcing is motivated not only by the
desire to lower product cost and retain price competitiveness but to be closer
to a healthy and growing telecom infrastructure market

sec companies have also responded by enhancing their research design and
development activity with the market decline the increased availability of
talented technical experts has helped these companies develop the products
needed to maintain market leadership examples include the development of new
application specific integrated circuit asic designs at quadrant and
transformer products for customer chip sets at dt magnetics

entering 2002 there is no clear evidence that the market will recover soon and
the group is operating at about the breakeven level

marking and coding
imaje the industrial business in this segment had a very strong year under a
new management team particularly considering the switch of one large customer
account to a different technology sales were up due both to the addition of the

determined in good faith by the compensation committee the compensation
committee determines the term of each option but in no event may an option be
exercised more than 10 years following the grant date no more than 600000
shares may be granted to a single participant in any one year options granted
under this plan may not be sold transferred hypothecated pledged or otherwise
disposed of by any of the holders except by will or by the laws of descent and

under this plan to members of the holders immediate family or to one or more
trusts for the benefit of such family members provided that the holder does not
receive any consideration for the transfer

exploration and production applications 8 of 59 discontinued operations dover elevator was sold to thyssen industrie ag currently thyssenkrupp on january 5 1999 for 12 billion in october of 2001 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 sfas no 144 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets and discontinued operations as encouraged by the fasb the company adopted sfas no 144 early in the fourth quarter of 2001 and has retroactively applied it to all transactions occurring during the fiscal year ended december 31 2001 all prior interim and full year reporting periods have been restated as required by this new accounting rule the application of this statement resulted in the classification and separate financial presentation of certain entities as discontinued operations which are not included in continuing operations effective april 10 2001 the company sold the welding equipment businesses of dovatech dover industries segment effective may 31 2001 the company sold ac compressor dover diversified segment both are accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 144 and accordingly amounts in the financial statements and related notes for all periods shown reflect discontinued operations accounting based on the findings from strategic evaluations of its continuing operations the company committed to plans to dispose of three small diversified operations and one small resources operation within a one year timeframe accordingly all four of these operations also qualified for discontinued operations presentation in 2001 raw materials dover’s operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally available from a number of sources as such shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had a material impact on operating profits research and development dover’s operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand sales opportunities improve product reliability and reduce production costs during 2001 approximately 1755 million was spent on research and development compared with 1704 million and 1347 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively for the dover technologies companies efforts in these areas tend to be particularly significant because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high in general dover technologies companies which provide electronic assembly equipment and services can anticipate that the performance “criteria” of such equipment are expected to improve significantly over time with a concurrent expectation of lower operating costs and increasing efficiency likewise dover technologies companies developing specialty electronic components for the datacom and telecom commercial markets anticipate a continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced cost such that product life cycles generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period dover industries dover resources and dover diversified contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes none of these businesses experience the “rate of change” in markets and products as are experienced generally by the dover technologies companies intellectual property dover owns over 1000 patents and is also licensed to use a number of patents primarily in the us but also in certain important nonus markets where it conducts business dover licenses some of its patents to other companies for which it collects royalties which are not significant these patents have been obtained over a number of years and expire at various times the loss or expiration of any one patent or group of patents would not materially affect dover or any of its segments where patents have expired dover believes that its commitment to leadership in continuous engineering improvements manufacturing techniques and other sales service and marketing efforts are significant to maintaining its general market leadership position from time to time dover has had disputes regarding its alleged use of other patented technology dover expects to resolve any such matters without any material impact on its businesses dover also owns more than 1000 registered trademarks and tradenames many of the company’s products are sold under various registered and unregistered trademarks and tradenames owned or licensed by the company among the most significant are belvac blackmer crenlo destaco dek dover duncan everett charles groen heil hill phoenix hydro systems imaje marathon midland norris ok international opw pdq quadrant rotary lift sargent somero swep tipper tie tranter triton tulsa winch universal waukesha wiseco and wilden 9 of 59 dover also owns over 300 copyrights the majority of which relate to machine software seasonality in general dover’s operations are not seasonal however those companies serving the transportation construction waste hauling petroleum commercial refrigeration and food service markets tend to be strong during the second and third quarters companies serving the major equipment markets such as power generation chemical and processing industries tend to have long lead times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands which tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends customers dover’s businesses serve thousands of customers no one of which accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated revenues in 2001 within each of the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of that segment’s sales in 2001 in the dover technologies segment the rapid growth in datacomtelecom infrastructure market development involving both equipment providers and software developers such as lucent motorola nortel cisco siemens phillips and qualcomm has tended to concentrate the new product development and demand with relatively few customers at the same time a number of these customers have “outsourced” a significant amount of their manufacturing capability to electronic manufacturing services ems companies such as jabil solectron celestica and flextronics which firms are now the direct customers of dover technologies companies for a number of different oem customers this has tended to increase the concentration of manufacturing with the ems’s companies and hence machine and specialty component demand is concentrated with a smaller number of “customers” in the other dover segments customer concentrations are quite varied companies supplying the automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power generation aerospace and chemical industries in the other markets served there is usually a much lower concentration of customers particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end use applications backlog backlog generally is not a significant factor in most of dover’s businesses as most of dover’s products have relatively short ordertodelivery periods it is more relevant to those businesses in the segments which produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily belvac heil trailer mark andy and sargent controls in 2001 backlog did decline significantly particularly for the specialty electronic component manufacturers driven largely by substantial declines in demand in the other segments there were very few isolated cases of increasing backlog and plant expansion undertaken in 2001 and 2000 was more than sufficient to address those situations total company backlog as of december 31 2001 and 2000 was 7433 million and 10035 million respectively competition dover’s competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of products manufactured and markets served in general most dover companies are market leaders which compete with only a few companies and the key competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation in addition since most of dover’s manufacturing operations are in the united states dover usually is a more significant competitor domestically than in foreign markets in the dover technologies segment dover competes globally against a few very large companies primarily operating in japan europe and the far east its primary competitors are japanese producers including fuji machine panasonic and tdkand european manufacturers like philips and siemens within the other segments competition is primarily domestic although an increasing number of dover companies see more international competitors and several serve markets which are predominantly international particularly belvac le quartzdyne rpa process technologies tipper tie tranter waukesha and wittemann during 2001 due to the strength of the us dollar dover’s competitive situation continued to be difficult for two related reasons first export sales and opportunities were hampered by the high value of the dollar versus foreign currencies second in select domestic markets sales were adversely impacted by competitive foreign products as long as the us dollar continues to be strong relative to other foreign currencies this trend is likely to continue 10 of 59 international for foreign sales export sales and an allocation of the assets of the company’s continuing operations see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item no 8 of this form 10k although international operations are subject to certain risks such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign governmental restrictions dover intends to increase its expansion into foreign markets the countries where most of dover’s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are based are france germany the uk the netherlands sweden and switzerland environmental matters dover believes its operations generally are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued compliance will not have any material impact on the company’s financial position going forward and will not require significant capital expenditures employees the company had approximately 26600 employees as of december 31 2001 










 item 2 properties the number type location and size of the company’s properties as of december 31 2001 are shown on the following charts by segment   the facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted during 2001 excess capacity rapidly developed within the technologies segment and to a much lesser degree within the other three segments during the year 2001 steps were taken to reduce capacity where appropriate 11 of 59 




 item 3 legal proceedings dover is party to a number of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of its businesses which in aggregate are not material to any one business or to the company taken as a whole dover is continuously involved with an examination by the internal revenue service the “irs” of the company’s federal income tax returns the company and the irs have settled tax years through 1995 the company expects to resolve open years 19961997 in the near future all within the amounts paid andor reserved for these liabilities the irs is currently examining the company’s 1998 and 1999 federal income tax returns additionally the company is routinely involved in state and local income tax audits and on occasion foreign jurisdiction tax audits based on insurance availability established reserves and periodic reviews of these matters management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of current pending claims and known contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary in 2001 dover corporation sales declined 14 from 2000 to 45 billion this decline was primarily due to the dramatic impact on dover technologies’ of the market contraction in demand for its products serving the electronics industry all of the dover technologies businesses were impacted at the same time many of the industrial businesses in the other three operating segments were negatively impacted by the slowdown in general economic activity as a result segment income from continuing operations totaled 3376 million in 2001 a decline of 61 from 2000 record earnings of 3920 million in technologies in 2000 a “boom” year became a loss of 130 million in 2001 industries’ earnings of 1910 million in 2000 declined 26 to 1422 million in 2001 the result of weak markets for most companies diversified’s earnings declined 38 from 1506 million in 2000 to 933 million in 2001 largely due to operational problems at crenlo but also due to weak markets for several businesses dover resources’ earnings declined 4 from 1200 million in 2000 to 1150 million in 2001 as strength in oil and gas related businesses until late in the year were offset by weakness in industrial markets as the result of unexpectedly weak market conditions efforts were made throughout the year and more intensively as the year progressed to “rightsize” by reducing employment levels eliminating costs and restructuring operations thus a series of restructuring and other charges were taken as discussed below and in note 3 of item 8 of this form 10k partially offsetting these negatives were a 43 million decline in corporate expense to 239 million a decline in net interest expense of 129 million to 753 million and a lower tax rate dover technologies dover technologies’ sales in 2001 declined 40 from the prior year to 12580 million due to the wellchronicled collapse of the technology sector technologies reported a loss of 130 million after 555 million in charges for restructurings inventory accounts receivable and other reserves following record earnings of 3920 million in 2000 the unprecedented “boom” year for the electronics manufacturing market the lack of endmarket demand for electronics equipment caused technologies’ circuit board assembly and test cbat businesses’ customers to dramatically curtail spending for its predominantly capital equipment products cbat sales declined 52 to 6513 million and record 2000 earnings of 2652 million were transformed to a 532 million loss technologies’ specialty electronics components sec businesses were similarly affected particularly given their product focus on the higher technology data communications telecommunications and networking markets sec sales declined 25 to 3970 million and record earnings in 2000 of 1040 million dropped to 312 million imaje the french based industrial inkjet printer manufacturer had another very successful year cbat universal instruments experienced the largest percentage sales decline from the prior year in this group of companies a decline so large that universal is no longer dover’s largest company and went from record profits to a sizable loss – indeed universal accounted for the majority of the loss at cbat universal’s high end products were particularly hard hit as large electronic manufacturing services ems and oem customers stopped adding capacity a similar thing occurred at universal’s alphasem subsidiary when semiconductor assembly customers stopped expanding dek whose increasingly well positioned broad line of circuit board screen printers had a smaller sales decline as they also have lower priced products that appeal to customers that were not as hard hit by the downturn vitronics soltec had a lower rate of decline than either universal or dek as its comprehensive range of soldering machines improved their competitive position dek and vitronics soltec both have a strong european base which trailed the us in the downturn and both companies managed to generate a modest level of profitability everett charles technologies’ sales in 2001 declined less dramatically because some of their products are not capital equipment and they acquired multitest at midyear contact spring probes for instance are not a capital item and demand depends more on its customer’s production volumes and new product introduction in electronics endmarkets however these markets which were also slow in 2001 the portion of the business serving the semiconductor test market including multitest though well positioned competitively saw demand decline to unanticipated low levels creating an overall loss ok international acquired in late 2000 experienced a sales decline similar to dek and vitronics soltec and reported a small loss in 2001 ok’s products are generally shorterlived tools or consumables thus ok also depends largely on 15 of 59 customers’ production levels which were declining entering 2001 and remained at depressed levels all year this condition persists entering 2001 customer demand for the large machines used in circuit board production which had increasingly been centered with the large ems customers had already begun to evaporate and backlog was little more than half of what it had been at the market peak six months earlier as bookings and backlog continued to decline losses mounted peaking in the third quarter in the fourth quarter with some relative stability in demand albeit at depressed levels together with the early benefits of substantial cost reductions losses began to diminish the reaction to the dramatic downturn was to “rightsize” the business by reducing employment and eliminating all but critical operating expenses at universal for instance near the end of 2001 a complete organizational restructuring accompanied the third major employment reduction for the year at the end of the year most remaining demand for larger machines was from smaller ems companies and some oems demands for replacement parts to service the installed base remanufactured machines other types of assembly machines and throughhole placement equipment were all also down substantially though not as dramatically as in the core surfacemount businesses at year end the group was still below the breakeven point throughout cbat product development critical for longterm market leadership in this still attractive market was maintained albeit under close cost benefit scrutiny universal has recently introduced a new product the all linear motor “gsmb” which sets new standards in “flexible fine pitch” applications a market segment requiring both high speed and extreme placement accuracy universal’s now selfsufficient alphasem offspring also introduced a new product the leading diesorter and die bonder suitable for the new 300 millimeter wafer technology expected to become predominant in semiconductor manufacturing at dek continued new product development and introduction in the traditional circuit board market are now also being supplemented by “wafer bumping” and “ball attach” applications for semiconductor manufacturers vitronics soltec’s new offerings range from redesigned machines for lowerend applications to entirely new technologies for “selective” soldering suitable for mixed component attachment applications entering 2002 the outlook for a near term revival in spending for cbat’s machines is not encouraging substantial excess productive capacity exists in the market and until there is a significant increase in endmarket demand or change in technological production requirements sales will remain at low levels elimination of losses as a result of business restructurings should occur sooner—perhaps as early as midyear the equipment companies are also planning their response to reflect a market where the dynamics clearly will have changed when the recovery does occur the customer base will have become more global—less us centered—with a geographic shift toward asia the response envisions accelerated product sourcing and manufacturing in china sec the sec companies all produce highly specialized often custom designed highend components used in a wide variety of electronic devices the largest served market is the telecommunications industry—both wired and wireless—primarily for infrastructure applications this market experienced a rapid rampup through 2000 entering 2001 backlogs were still high and much of the customer base remained optimistic that they could maintain reasonable volume levels however order intake and market optimism dropped precipitously in the first quarter of 2001 and backlog declined all year in the wired infrastructure endmarket sec’s customers were hurt as the collapse of the “dotcom bubble” left the market glutted with unused equipment and demand from endcustomers could not support the existing expanded capacity in the wireless market the much anticipated boom in new markets and applications such as “3g” failed to materialize and the high cost of frequency licenses followed by a contraction of capital availability caused many carriers to restrict or eliminate spending demand in end markets for access devices cable and dsl modems telephones and the like also slowed sharply in many cases sec’s customers were left with excess component inventory causing not only low demand but also cancellations of prior orders in other cases customers new product launches critical to sec’s leading technology orientation were curtailed other markets for sec representing roughly one third of sales include the high reliabilityoriented military satellite aerospace and industrial markets the sec companies saw modest growth in these markets in 2001 as evidenced by the improved earnings at dowkey microwave sec was somewhat cushioned by its geographic profile as the market slowdown spread from the us to europe and then asia novacap in particular which acquired likesized ukbased syfer in 2000 with complementary technologies and customers benefited from syfer’s relatively stronger demand through the first half of the year each sec company has responded by significantly reducing headcount restricting unnecessary spending and lowering product cost dt magnetics for instance aggressively restructured its business by downsizing higher cost us operations and expanding off shore manufacturing—in this case in the dominican republic k  l microwave and 16 of 59 quadrant both moved aggressively to expand business opportunities in china the focus on china sourcing is motivated not only by the desire to lower product cost and retain price competitiveness but to be closer to a healthy and growing telecom infrastructure market sec companies have also responded by enhancing their research design and development activity with the market decline the increased availability of talented technical experts has helped these companies develop the products needed to maintain market leadership examples include the development of new application specific integrated circuit asic designs at quadrant and transformer products for customer chip sets at dt magnetics entering 2002 there is no clear evidence that the market will recover soon and the group is operating at about the breakeven level as demonstrated by customers’ continued collaborative product development work with the sec companies the longerterm outlook remains strong marking and coding imaje the industrial business in this segment had a very strong year under a new management team particularly considering the switch of one large customer account to a different technology sales were up due both to the addition of the markpoint acquisition in june 2001 and to a concentrated market penetration effort earnings declined slightly due to acquisition integration costs and expenses related to the upgrade of the organization particularly in the sales network but margins remained high while the industrial markets imaje serves are weak the company’s geographic diversity and the technical and market initiatives undertaken in 2001 are expected to yield improved results in 2002 dover industries dover industries’ sales in 2001 declined 4 to 11601 million as general weakness in its industrial and commercial markets impacted most of its companies heil environmental texas hydraulics and the food service markets of groen and randell experienced the largest sales declines continuing earnings of 1422 million were reduced for the year by 46 million in charges for restructurings inventory accounts receivable and other reserves without those charges earnings were down 23 segment operating profit margins declined from 159 to 123 after heil environmental’s strongest earning year in its history in 2000 market conditions entering 2001 outside of large municipal markets such as new york city were showing signs of softness as the year progressed all the negative factors which can make this business cyclical such as capital spending constraints at the large waste haulage companies higher fuel costs and the impact of economic uncertainty on spending plans particularly by the independent smaller operators were in evidence the loss of a major portion of one large customer’s business during the first quarter compounded this problem as did a slow down in product acceptance in new york city after september 11th these factors led results for the year to fall below those of the prior two years both of which were new records at the time nonetheless 2001 represented the third best year in company history and though margins declined they remained significantly above the average for all industries companies heil environmental has responded with programs for lowering product cost both through product redesign and “lean” manufacturing initiatives these efforts should help gain business and increase margins in 2002 although the general economic factors influencing the customer base have not changed and fourth quarter 2001 ending backlogs were at the lowest level of the year marathon influenced by many of the same industry dynamics was plagued not only by a very weak market but also by fierce competition from a heavily leveraged competitor liquidating inventory at low prices marathon has a much broader range of product capability than any of its competitors and can adapt more readily in such a market—and it did receive important new business with large national waste haulage and chain store accounts however marathon typically operates with relatively low backlogs and the weak economy particularly since the fourth quarter has led the company to focus on internal cost containment programs to maintain its still above average margin levels for rotary lift long one of industries’ largest earnings contributors and increasingly so 2001 was both a very challenging and successful year the market for automotive lifts was down 12 after a smaller decline the prior year however rotary’s sales in 2001 were flat with the prior year and it further improved its leading market share position rotary successfully continued its track record of using cost reduction to drive price competitiveness in the market while maintaining margins rotary was also able to solidify its position by developing a new product “inbay™ having the most technologically advanced product has helped grow market share particularly with larger accounts such as the large auto repair chains entering 2002 market conditions remain weak heil trailer one of industries’ largest companies measured by sales endured its second straight year of doubledigit percentage earnings declines which in turn followed a year of flat earnings because of the continuing recession in its markets capital spending programs at the major oil companies for petroleum tankers have been hurt by the wave of 17 of 59 industry consolidations and the market for dry bulk trailers has remained very weak a pickup in military orders particularly at the recently acquired kalynsiebert business helped later in the year the decline in the market has intensified competitive pricing pressure heil has responded with new products such as safer low profile petroleum tanker trailers and a repeatedly demonstrated commitment to cost reductions heil has thus been able to stabilize margins albeit at much lower than traditional levels late in the year heil suffered currency losses in its argentine operation due to that country’s currency crisis but the other small operations in the uk and thailand both showed improved performance heil trailer’s ability to address global oil companies’ international product and service needs is a distinct competitive advantage entering 2002 the impact of the economic downturn on customer spending plans has dampened enthusiasm about the prospect of a quick market recovery texas hydraulics’ historical growth in sales and earnings with very strong margins has been driven by a product differentiation strategy to provide engineered solutions to customers’ hydraulic cylinder needs however in 2001 all served markets were down substantially particularly in texas hydraulics’ important aerial lift and utility platform markets this trend began in 2000 and was driven by consolidation in the rental equipment endmarkets for these applications it resulted in a substantial decline in sales and earnings but a more modest margin deterioration texas hydraulics has responded by reemphasizing penetration in other endmarkets through new products and new designs but price competition has been fierce due to excess industry capacity thus significant investment has been made in “lean manufacturing” tools and techniques leading to higher quality quicker response time to customers and lower labor and material cost with market conditions remaining depressed it is unclear how well or whether all of texas hydraulics’ weaker competitors will survive the downturn pdq which joined dover in mid1998 turned in yet another full year of substantial sales and earnings growth based on its continued penetration of the vehicle wash equipment market with its innovative “touchless” products pdq’s success is based on successful new market introductions close attention to competitive pricing and continual cost reductions tipper tie struggled in 2001 with both internal and external problems that led to flat sales and lower margins early in the year demand for capital equipment from meat processors was severely reduced by the “mad cow” and “hoof and mouth” disease scares particularly in europe where roughly 50 of tipper tie’s sales are generated though this effect dissipated as the year progressed margins for new equipment came under pressure as the soft market caused fierce competition intense price competition was also seen in the clip market miscues in product introductions further depressed earnings entering 2002 cost reductions particularly in the us the introduction of proven european products into the us market and new clip designs are the focus of tipper tie’s still new management team triton which was acquired in early 2000 has underperformed initial expectations and 2001 was a particularly difficult year sales were flat but profits were a fraction of the prior year adverse external factors included an industry upheaval caused by the rapid rise and then decline to bankruptcy of credit card center ccc an independent sales organization that flooded the market with competitor’s product this resulted in a market overloaded with a great many unused atm machines when ccc’s business model proved unviable that overhang which has not been fully absorbed by early 2002 is further complicated by slowing domestic market growth and resultant price competition internally triton has struggled with delayed new product development and introductions as well as manufacturing inefficiencies in the fourth quarter of 2001 triton executed a major staff reduction realigned the management structure in marketing and manufacturing and reinvigorated the product pipeline triton’s sales and earnings margins should increase when these initiatives take hold somero acquired in mid1999 has also failed to meet initial expectations and sales and earnings have declined significantly since acquisition further declines are expected in 2002 the somero market niche is small and narrow and its construction markets remain depressed chief automotive has been challenged for three years by the sluggish growth of a maturing market chief has responded by focusing on new product introductions and marketing programs geared to induce customers to trade up to new highend products sales and earnings declined in 2001 but chief is maintaining market leadership and high returns on operating investment groen’s institutional food service equipment market declined in 2001 particularly in the fourth quarter causing groen’s sales and earnings to also decline a new management team has reinvigorated product development and has begun introducing product line extensions and variations and has a new cost conscious business model to grow margins and cash flow randell’s market concentrated in the restaurant chains has grown for a number of years as the percentage of meals eaten away from home increased however this trend may have slowed the market increasingly competitive now 18 of 59  depends more on renovations and less on new construction for 2001 these trends were amplified in the weak economic environment and margins suffered in 2002 randell expects to renew its focus on new product development as a strategy to gain share and on operational improvements for competitiveness and margin recovery after the sale of its main line welding products business in april of 2001 dovatech’s remaining laser and laser cooler business was hit hard by the economic downturn particularly in solidstate applications for the telecommunications industry machine tool customers also slowed orders as the year progressed dover diversified dover diversified’s sales increased 8 in 2001 to 11046 million but earnings declined 38 to 933 million continuing earnings were reduced 181 million by charges for restructurings inventory accounts receivable and other reserves before these charges earnings were down 26 segment profit margins declined to 84 from 148 a substantial amount of the decline in earnings related to crenlo where strong earnings in 2000 became a significant loss in 2001 this along with earnings declines at tranter mark andy and swf caused by difficult market conditions offset gains at hill phoenix sargent waukesha and performance motorsports hill phoenix’s sales increased dramatically setting a new record in 2001 easily retaining its number one sales position within diversified this was accomplished in a market that declined about 7 during the year hill phoenix’s 2001 market share gain should establish it as the strong number two company in its highly competitive marketplace market share growth was a function both of being well positioned with the fastest growing customers and of penetrating new key accounts some of these are the large discount chains that are becoming larger competitors of the supermarket operators bookings grew and backlog increased all through the year until the fourth quarter when some spending commitments were delayed into the coming year earnings were also sharply higher as margins were maintained both sales and earnings were helped to a degree by the contribution of national cooler a walkin cooler case business acquired in september 2000 in an effort to broaden the product line which was successfully integrated into hill phoenix operations in a year when the competitive landscape was marked by consolidation particularly in the supermarket industry the stability and experience of the hill phoenix management team and the perceived technical superiority of its product line both contributed to growth in market share based on current backlogs and customer spending plans hill phoenix is poised for a very strong year in 2002 however the impact of the general economic slowdown on the customer base could dampen demand tranter one of diversified’s largest businesses again captured the distinction of being its largest profit contributor despite significant erosion in profit margin tranter’s trend of steady growth and high stable margins was broken in a very challenging 2001 tranter is highly dependent on industrial capital spending one of the weakest sectors of the economy in addition the strength of the us dollar gave foreignbased competitors an advantage in the us radiator market and price competition was severe also because of us dollar strength the profitability of tranter’s foreign operations was lower when translated from local currency some plant inefficiencies and temporary product line gaps also contributed to the shortfall in earnings entering 2002 tranter’s markets remain challenging some relief from the competitiveness and translation issues would come from a weakening dollar however it is unknown whether the inroads into the us market made by foreign competitors over the last year will be easily reversed crenlo had a very disappointing year as a variety of postacquisition management challenges were further complicated by a weak market for which it was not well prepared this led to a substantial loss for 2001 in contrast to a highly profitable 2000 the first year after acquisition throughout 2000 crenlo had focused on growing sales by providing a cost effective quality source of cab enclosures to customers who had often manufactured these internally during the same period the market for its electronics enclosures product line was growing dramatically with the electronics market generally a decision to build a second large fully integrated plant for cabs was made in early 2000 and by mid2001 the plant was complete in early 2001 it became apparent that during this growthoriented period not only had internal controls over inventory begun to suffer but also product costs had risen and pricing had eroded while fixed costs had risen substantially faster than the business was growing a new president was installed and he began the process of dealing with internal controls and aligning the cost structure more closely to the existing order intake levels as the year progressed all served markets began to slow down and then late in the year contract rapidly costs added from the new plant added complexity to the management challenge new management’s improvement initiatives were unable to keep pace with the declining market and losses continued as 2002 begins the level of incoming orders is very low making efforts to restore profitability difficult the current focus is on customer satisfaction through ontime delivery 19 of 59 quality and value and on regaining crenlo’s historically stable profit profile some market improvement will be required to restore profitability sargent’s 2001 sales adjusted for operations discontinued in the fourth quarter were up sharply due to a strong backlog at the beginning of the year and stable conditions in both the aerospace and marine markets for much of the year however with the weakening of market conditions after the september 11th terrorist attacks aerospace order intake particularly in the profitable aftermarket segment of the business declined precipitously along with airline traffic earnings for the year were also up to record levels as margins remained stable despite heavy investment in new regional jet and marine product development programs at the end of the year the airtomic business which had been part of c lee cook in the dover resources segment was transferred to sargent because of very strong synergies in the aerospace aftermarket repair and overhaul sector the incremental sales will roughly replace those of the discontinued operations but with much higher margins entering 2002 sargent’s marine business remains very strong but shipments to aircraft oem’s are expected to decline sharply and maintaining growth in the aftermarket in aerospace will be difficult investment in new aerospace programs and in developing new aftermarket service capabilities will continue mark andy’s printing markets were weak throughout 2001 leading to a substantial drop in profitability sales were higher due to the acquisition of comco at the end of march but its sales and profitability were substantially below expectations as well as a result of the weak market the integration of comco was accelerated with more cost cutting at both facilities than had been originally planned significant reductions in employment and plant consolidations helped at both businesses but these actions were not able to restore margins mark andy also consolidated facilities at its graphics microsystems business entering 2002 there is no evidence that mark andy’s markets will recover soon with the cost reductions completed todate a renewed emphasis on marketing and new product development and continued focus on gaining efficiencies mark andy is wellpositioned for an improvement in the market but significant improvement in profitability will likely await better market conditions waukesha bearings set an earnings record in 2001 on sharply higher sales this was driven primarily by continued strength in demand for its large bearing products from the gas turbine market demand for electrical power generation capacity was particularly strong and bookings and backlog remained at high levels throughout the year however the likely duration of this market’s “boom” period which had been expected to continue for at least a few more years has recently been questioned with the decline in electrical usage in the economic downturn relative to capacity recently added waukesha’s geographic penetration technical capabilities and product offerings were substantially improved with the third quarter acquisition of federal mogul rpb a uk based bearing manufacturing company this acquisition makes waukesha the clear market leader in its niche entering 2002 and at least for the short term the benefits of the acquisition and a continued robust turbine business should boost profits performance motorsports inc pmi had a much stronger sales and earnings performance in 2001 than it did in the prior year and a record performance on both metrics with consistently high margins though this was helped by acquisitions of the carillo and perfect bore businesses in the second half the core business also performed well for most of the year some market weakness was evident in the fourth quarter performance improvements were primarily due to investments in manufacturing efficiency and technical capabilities tangible improvements in throughput quality and cost reduction were also due to a successful focus on “lean manufacturing” tools and techniques the recent acquisitions though small have also helped position pmi well in its markets through improved geographic coverage manufacturing synergies and a broader array of technical capabilities for each of its market segments the combination of the benefits of the acquisitions for the full year 2002 expected acquisition related synergies and the continuing results of internal improvements should offset the impact that a possibly weaker market environment might have swf’s sales increased substantially in 2001 largely due to the full year impact of acquisitions made in 2000 and the contribution of acquisitions made early in 2001 however earnings declined for two reasons externally the market for swf’s packaging machine products was down an estimated 20 in this environment swf was able to maintain market share internally the management complexity of the acquisition integration process caused some slippage in focus on customers and product cost improved internal processes and the renewed focus on product improvement and internal cost control should help improve margins regardless of market conditions a market recovery in 2002 would result in substantial positive operating leverage belvac’s position as the only remaining independent supplier of can forming equipment ties its fortunes to the capital spending cycles and sourcing preferences of its customers some of whom have competing inhouse capabilities belvac is now structured to perform well even in the cyclical troughs in this market thus the weak market experienced in 2001 resulted in a meaningful sales decline but a more modest profit decline enhancing its profile as a strong cash flow contributor 20 of 59 in 2001 langbein  engelbracht’s sales increased modestly however earnings were flat as competitive pricing pressures held margins down improved market segmentation investment in sales coverage focus on higher first pass yield and project bidding with complementary suppliers may lead to more opportunities but anemic economic growth in europe will be a limiting factor dover resources dover resources sales in 2001 increased 7 to a record 9425 million largely due to strength in the oil and gas production markets served by petroleum equipment group c lee cook and quartzdyne and due to the full year impact of addon acquisitions in 2000 earnings of 1150 million in 2001 were reduced by 86 million in charges for restructurings inventory accounts receivable and other reserves without those charges earnings would have been slightly higher than the prior year operating profit margins declined from 137 in 2000 to 122 in 2001 as very difficult conditions in the automotive and transportation markets impacted several dover resources’ companies petroleum equipment group’s “peg” 2001 sales and earnings were both about 20 higher than in 2000 reaching a modern record post early 1980’s boom period through the first half of the year demand was strong in the oil and gas production markets served and across all product lines but particularly for sucker rods used in oil production after midyear these markets weakened considerably and by the end of 2001 peg’s results were comparable to the same period in 2000 significant investments in production capabilities and business streamlining initiatives since 1998 have resulted in lower product costs improved flexibility and reduced cycle times these initiatives have also helped peg further increase its market penetration lower oil prices discouraged new drilling as the year progressed declining natural gas prices also reduced spending by natural gas producers however all peg units were able to maintain solid profitability even while demand was weakening norriseal has been able to regain market share for its valves and controls through enhanced customer service norris and aot have been successful with their sucker rod guide initiatives and fergusonbeauregard’s plunger lift product line achieved solid success with its new initiative to provide complete control systems to natural gas producers entering 2002 demand is declining due to reduced oil and gas prices and comparisons to a much stronger 2001 period will likely be unfavorable the outlook is clouded by global economic uncertainty and the impact that geopolitical events might have on oil and gas prices c lee cook’s record sales and earnings results in 2001 reflected strong demand from the natural gas production and distribution customers both oem and aftermarket for its gas compressor components cook’s recent investments in improved manufacturing processes increased capacity new products product line extensions and strong results from the service and repair operations at its compressor components unit contributed to the company’s ability to capitalize on the strong market the demand for increased natural gas production evident earlier in 2001 has waned as new production has become available and demand and prices declined in a weaker economy as a result c lee cook’s sales in the oem segment of the market will likely decline in 2002 with some possible offset from increased emphasis on aftermarket sales of components and services new product initiatives and increased penetration in international markets quartzdyne also had record sales and earnings in 2001 as high oil prices spurred new oil well drilling and completions in the first half of the year a result of product development initiatives quartzdyne’s “ruggedized” pressure transducer product line utilizing enhanced quartz pressure sensor technology and hybrid circuit designs is being increasingly used in measurement while drilling permanent pressure measurement and “intelligent completions” applications in 2001 opw fueling components managed a modest sales increase and maintained flat earnings and margins in a challenging market new service station construction activity has continued to be slow as pricing pressure on the major oil companies and convenience store chains have curtailed investment the only source of significant new retail station growth has been in the “hypermarket” segment industry consolidation at all levels of the market—oil companies distributors and competitors—has been a dampening factor but has left the company in a comparatively favorable position because of its strong product line and global reach replacement demand for opw fueling components’ broad product line of gasoline nozzles and other service station devices has been more stable success continues with the pisces™ line of underground secondary containment systems and with petro vend’s automated fuel management systems opw fueling components’ investment for its new line of enhanced vapor recovery products positions it well as environmental compliance expectations increase in all markets in 2001 opw fluid transfer group suffered from continued weakness in its petroleum dry bulk chemical and petrochemical transportationrelated businesses the benefits of a major business restructuring initiative undertaken in 1999 which boosted 2000’s results also helped maintain respectable margins in 2001 nevertheless further cost reductions and restructuring actions were undertaken during the year opw fluid transfer group’s focus in 2002 will be 21 of 59 to maintain margins in a weak market as it continues new product development and customer service initiatives in order to benefit from substantial positive operating leverage when transportation markets recover as a result of internal and operational improvements better results from its international sales channels and successful introduction of a complete line of plastic bolted pumps wilden has maintained solid operational profitability in spite of the generally weak industrial and process industry markets it serves wilden is expected to benefit from favorable operating leverage when its core markets improve blackmer experienced a significant profit improvement in 2001 as higher european sales and a more pronounced increase in european margins resulted from the streamlining actions initiated in 2000 with the exception of governmentrelated sales most of blackmer’s other served markets—industrial petroleum chemical and petrochemical and transportationrelated—were generally weaker than the prior year a number of sales channel initiatives as well as marketing and manufacturing efficiency improvements made in 2001 should cushion blackmer in a market that is expected to remain weak in 2002 the full year impact of acquisitions at tulsa winch group led to record sales and earnings in the early part of the year tulsa winch benefited from strong demand from its oem customer base and a very strong market for its oil field winch product line as the year progressed the oil field related market weakened and sales to its oem market slowed dramatically further progress is expected in 2002 in achieving synergistic benefits from the four previously independent companies that now comprise the tulsa winch group in the weak market expected in 2002 these operational improvements and a more focused product offering will help position the company well for market recovery destaco industries was challenged in 2001 by low general industrial market demand for its clamping and workplace automation products particularly because of its sales concentration in the domestic automotive industry this decline in enduser demand was made more pronounced by inventory reduction in distribution channels international markets were also weak made worse by the strong us dollar sales of robotic equipment in the electronics assembly market also declined severely the result was a slump in profitability and margin decline destaco industries has responded with numerous rightsizing actions and a focus on factory productivity solutions this effort was boosted by the acquisition of cpi end of robot arm devices at the beginning of the year with further market declines expected destaco industries will accelerate market penetration efforts and continue tight cost control measures to hold profitability until economic conditions improve in 2001 destaco manufacturing maintained profits by reducing costs in the face of severe margin pressure from its automotive customer base and at the end of the year finalized plans to exit an underperforming business segment in 2002 destaco manufacturing will focus on its core compressor reed valve and ride control disc customers with a muchreduced cost structure but market conditions are expected to remain challenging rpa process technologies rpa had significant improvements in both sales and operating profit as its european unit recovered from a very poor performance in 2000 the year it was acquired capital spending in rpa’s markets particularly in the paper industry was weak throughout 2001 and entering 2002 there are few signs of nearterm recovery in the global process industry markets that rpa serves hydro systems had a record year for both sales and earnings as a result of success with new product and market initiatives and progress with cost reduction efforts the institutional and industrial cleaning market served by hydro systems has proven to be relatively recession resistant although some market weakness is being experienced as hydro systems enters 2002 the global market for carbon dioxide generation and recovery equipment supplied by wittemann remains quite depressed and although duncan had another difficult year in 2001 improved performance in the second half resulted from a reduced cost structure and increased customer focus critical accounting policies the company’s consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the external disclosures of the company including information regarding contingencies risk and the financial condition the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to generally accepted accounting principles and are consistently and conservatively applied valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and conservatism on a consistent basis throughout the company primary areas where financial information of dover is 22 of 59 subject to the use of estimates assumptions and the application of judgment include revenues receivables inventories warranties acquisitions and intangible assets taxes legal and environmental contingencies and accruals the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of ownership have passed to the buyer allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses adjusting for current economic conditions and in some cases evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances though dover considers these balances adequate and proper changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required in times of rapid market decline such as affected a number of dover technologies’ companies in 2001 reserve balances need to be adjusted in response to these unusual circumstances the company’s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market under certain market conditions estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory dover technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time during the year the company established restructuring reserves at a number of operations these reserves for both severance and exit costs required the use of estimates though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans actual results may be different dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions dover’s assets are tested and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis under the established accounting guidelines changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations the valuation of dover’s pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assetsliabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and benefits and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used in dover’s pension reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for dover’s future pension obligations changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on dover’s pension expenses and related funding requirements dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal state and international issues that are currently unresolved the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes changes in statutory tax rates and the company’s future taxable income levels dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions dover experience and relevant industry data dover considers the current level of accrual and reserves adequately valued relative to current market conditions and company experience dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dover’s ultimate exposure in these matters the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is properly reserved reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues while dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate changes in the future could impact these determinations liquidity and capital resources the company’s current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities on a continuing operations basis increased to 202 at december 31 2001 compared with 122 at december 31 2000 the quick ratio current assets net of inventories divided by current liabilities increased to 121 at december 31 2001 compared with 74 at december 31 2000 23 of 59 under the terms of a revolving credit agreement dated november 13 2001 with a group of 15 banks the company has 7500 million of bank credit availability this credit facility was unused during 2001 and at december 31 2001 the primary purpose of the revolving credit agreement is to act as an alternative avenue of short term financing in the event of a disruption in the commercial paper market the

years — 58 during 2001 the company’s entire capital expenditure program 1668 million was financed internally the company expects to be able to internally finance capital expenditures in 2002 as indicated by the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2001 net cash from operating activities increased to 6788 million in 2001 from 5454 million in 2000 this increase was driven primarily by a 2827 decrease in working capital principally receivables and inventory offset by a decline in net earnings of 52 or 2711 million net cash used in investment activities aggregated 4275 million in 2001 compared with 5946 million in 2000 the change from year to year was primarily due to decreased acquisition spending payments made in early 2002 for acquisition transactions totaled 422 million net cash used in financing activities was 5453 million in 2001 compared with net cash from financing activities of 4110 million in 2000 the principal causes for the swing of 9563 million were a net decrease of 4032 million in longterm debt and notes payable in 2001 compared to an increase of 5543 million in 2000 and a 263 million increase in the amount spent on stock repurchases at december 31 2001 the company’s net property plant and equipment amounted to 7614 million compared with 7152 million at the end of the preceding year intangible assets net of amortization increased by 1466 million during 2001 principally as a result of goodwill arising from acquisitions the aggregate of current and deferred income tax liabilities increased from 1096 million at the beginning of the year to 2141 million at year end this increase resulted primarily from extensions granted for 2001 us estimated tax payments retained earnings increased from 3252 billion at the beginning of 2001 to 3395 billion at december 31 2001 the 143 million increase results from 2001 net earnings of 249 million less cash dividends which aggregated 106 million stockholders’ equity increased from 2442 billion to 2520 billion the 78 million increase results mainly from the 143 million increase in retained earnings offset by treasury stock purchases of 32 million and equity adjustments related to foreign currency fluctuations of 37 million dover’s consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by 527 million in 2001 the increase was due principally to increases in actuarial losses in addition plan assets decreased 486 million due to losses sustained on plan investments during the year due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans it is estimated that pension expense will increase approximately 7 million in 2002 the company does not anticipate having to contribute to its qualified benefit plans in the near term 24 of 59 in 2001 the company announced various restructuring programs at selected operating companies these programs were implemented to reduce the company’s overall cost structure and to eliminate certain nonstrategic or redundant product lines and facilities the total continuing restructuring charges related to these programs in 2001 was 209 million the restructuring charges included both employee separation costs and costs associated with exit activities employee separation costs of 154 million involved approximately 2500 voluntary and involuntary separations these reductions were spread out across several geographic regions and employee classes facility closings and related charges of 55 million were incurred at ten operating locations these restructuring amounts were charged to either cost of sales or selling and administrative expenses as a component of operating earnings the company expects to complete these restructuring programs by the end of fiscal year 2002 the anticipated impact of these programs once fully implemented is expected to have an incrementally positive though at this time undetermined impact on continuing operations in addition to the restructuring charges discussed above the company established inventory accounts receivable and other reserves partially offset by related reductions in performance bonuses resulting in a total charge to continuing operations in 2001 of 868 million 684 million of which related to the third and fourth quarter these charges were predominately in the technologies and diversified segments nearly half of the first and second quarter total of 184 million related to inventory reserves established at crenlo and the bulk of the second half charges were in technologies the devaluation of the argentine peso had an immaterial impact on the results of the company in 2001 other pronouncements in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 sfas no 143 establishes the accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets under sfas no 143 the costs of retiring an asset will be recorded as a liability when the retirement obligation arises and will be amortized over the life of the asset the company is still assessing the potential impact of sfas no 143 on its consolidated results of operations and financial position see also notes 1e 1k and 1l to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements

components quartzdyne benefited from new exploration and development and from industry emphasis on more complex drilling and production techniques that improve well output the opw fluid transfer group increased earnings although its markets weakened as the year progressed sales at opw engineered systems civaconknappco and midland manufacturing were constrained by a falloff in bulk transportation markets the 1999 restructuring which involved closing a factory and shifting production to other facilities contributed to the earnings increase tulsa winch consolidated showed substantially improved

         in general dover sells its products and services directly and through
various distributors sales and commission agents and manufacturers
representatives in all cases generally consistent with the custom of the
industry and market being served however the larger dover companies and those
companies selling more highly engineering products and services or those
companies supplying products and services to markets characterized by a few
major customers typically sell direct because of the specialized nature of the
equipment and products being sold for more information on these segments and

discontinued operation

         dover elevator which was the companys fifth business segment for all
of 1998 was sold to thyssen industrie ag on january 5 1999 for 11 billion
plus the sharing of certain expenses arising out of the transaction

         dover elevators business principally the installation and service of
a product based on largely mature technology was seen as fundamentally
different from dovers other businesses which focus on manufacturing a variety
of products based on sophisticated and developing technology dover elevators


                                       4
page   5
business was conducted by service employees at thousands of construction sites
and buildings around the country while dovers other businesses are conducted
largely by manufacturing employees centered in factories as a result dover
found that its experience in managing its other businesses while transferable
among those businesses was not equally applicable to the elevator business
which consequently required a disproportionate amount of management attention

         at the time of sale dover elevator was the nations largest
manufacturer and installer and one of the largest servicers of elevators for
low and midrise buildings dover elevator also participated in the highrise
market for new equipment and service and sold and serviced elevators in foreign
markets principally in canada and asia somewhat less than half of dover
elevators sales and almost all of its profits in 1998 were generated by the
service business

raw materials

         dovers operating companies use a wide variety of raw materials
primarily metals and semiprocessed or finished components which are generally
available from a number of sources during 2000 temporary shortages andor
increased delivery times occurred more frequently but did not result in any
material business interruptions or major problems to date the cost of raw
materials while trending upward have not had a material impact on operating
profits

research and development

         dovers operating companies are encouraged to develop new products as
well as upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs expand
sales opportunities improve product reliability and reduce production costs
during 2000 approximately 1753 million was spent on research and development
compared with 1393 million and 1313 million in 1999 and 1998 respectively

         for the dover technologies companies efforts in these areas tend to be
particularly significant because the rate of product development by their
customers is often quite high in general dover technologies companies which
provide electronic assembly equipment and services can anticipate that the
performance metrics of such equipment are expected to improve significantly
over time with a concurrent expectation of lower operating costs and increasing
efficiency likewise dover technologies companies developing specialty
electronic components for the datacom and telecom commercial markets anticipate
a continuing rate of product performance improvement and reduced cost such that
product life cycles generally average less than five years with meaningful sales
price reductions over that time period

         dover industries dover resources and dover diversified contain many
businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives
these businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific
applications expanding product lines and market applications and continuously
improving manufacturing processes


intellectual property

         dover owns over 1100 patents and is also licensed to use a number of
patents covering a few of its product lines primarily in the us but also in
certain important nonus markets where it conducts business dover licenses
some of its patents to other companies for which it collects royalties which are
not significant these patents have been obtained over a number of years and
expire at various times and the loss or expiration of any one patent or group
of patents would not materially affect dover or any of its segments where
patents have expired dover believes that its commitment to leadership in
continuous engineering improvements manufacturing techniques and other sales
service and marketing efforts are significant to maintaining its general market
leadership position from time to time dover has had disputes regarding its
alleged use of other patented technology dover expects to resolve any such
matters without any material impact on its businesses

         dover also owns more than 1000 registered trademarks and tradenames
many of the companys products are sold under various registered and
unregistered trademarks and tradenames owned or licensed by the company among
the most significant are ac compressor belvac blackmer crenlo

         dover also owns over 100 copyrights the majority of which relate to
machine software

         in connection with the sale of dover elevator which closed on january
5 1999 the company transferred all the intellectual property used by dover
elevator to the buyers with the exception of the dover name and logo and
certain patents in the united states australia canada and great britain which
were used by dover elevator and other dover segments the company granted the
buyers a 3 12 year royaltyfree license to use the dover name and logo on
dover elevator products made in the ordinary course of business within the
territories in which dover elevator operated as of the sale the buyers were
granted an exclusive paidup irrevocable worldwide license to use the 25
patents used by dover elevator and other dover segments within the conduct of
dover elevators business after the sale but only to the extent such business
was conducted as of the sale

seasonality

         in general dovers operations are not seasonal however those
companies serving the transportation construction waste hauling petroleum
commercial refrigeration and food service markets tend to be strong during the
second and third quarters companies serving the major equipment markets such
as power generation chemical and processing industries tend to have long lead
times geared to seasonal commercial or consumer demands which tend to delay or
accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends

customers

         dovers businesses serve thousands of customers no one of which
accounted for more than 10 of the companys consolidated revenues in 2000
within each of the four segments no customer accounted for more than 10 of
that segments sales in 2000 however dover technologies companies have
experienced increasing concentration of customer demand with the respective top
five customers in 2000 accounting for 39 of universal instruments revenue 25
of cbat revenue and 20 of the segment revenue

         in the dover technologies segment the rapid growth in datacomtelecom
infastructure market development involving both equipment providers and
software developers such as lucent motorola nortel cisco siemens phillips
and qualcomm has tended to concentrate the new product development and demand
into a relatively few customers at the same time a number of these customers
have outsourced a significant amount of their manufacturing capability to
contract manufacturers cems such as jabil solectron celestica and
flextronics which firms are now the direct customers of dover technologies
companies for a number of different oem customers this has tended to increase
the concentration of manufacturing with cems and hence machine and specialty
component demand is concentrated with a smaller number of customers

         in the other dover segments customer concentrations are quite varied
companies supplying the automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend
to deal with a few large customers which are significant within those
industries this also tends to be true for companies supplying the power
generation aerospace and chemical industries as well in the other markets
served there is usually much less concentration of customers particularly
where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services
applicable to a broad range of end use applications

backlog

         backlog generally is not a significant factor in most of dovers
businesses as most of dovers products have relatively short delivery periods
it is more relevant to those businesses in the segments which produce larger and
more sophisticated machines or have longterm government contracts primarily

controls and universal in


                                       6
page   7
2000 backlog did become somewhat significant particularly for the specialty
electronic component manufacturers driven largely by significant increases in
demand which could not be satisfied by then existing productive capacity
during 2000 several of the dover technologies companies committed to
significant plant expansion in response to this large demand including
universal instruments some of the quadrant companies as well as novacap k  l
and dt magnetics

         in the other segments there were isolated cases of increasing backlog
and as appropriate plant expansion was undertaken in 2000 to address those
situations

         total company backlog as of december 31 2000 and 1999 was 1059
million and 928 million respectively based on the steps taken during 2000
the company believes that this backlog may reasonably be filled during the
fiscal year 2001

competition

         dovers competitive environment is complex because of the wide
diversity of products manufactured and markets served in general most dover
companies are market leaders which compete with only a few companies and the key
competitive factors are customer service product quality and innovation in
addition since most of dovers manufacturing operations are in the united
states dover usually is a more significant competitor domestically than in
foreign markets

         in the technologies segment dover competes globally against a few very
large companies primarily based in japan or europe its primary competitors are
japanese producers including fuji machine panasonic and tdk and european
manufacturers like philips and siemens

         within the other segments competition is primarily domestic although
an increasing number of dover subsidiaries see more international competitors
and several serve markets which are predominantly international particularly
ac compressor alberta oil tool belvac central research labs destaco
duncan l  e norris opw fueling components ronningenpetter tipper
tietechnopak tranter triton swep van dam wilden and wittemann

         during 2000 due to the generally unfavorable currency situation
dovers competitive situation became somewhat more difficult for two related
reasons first export sales and opportunities were hampered by the high value
of the dollar versus foreign currencies second in select domestic markets
sales were adversely impacted by competitive foreign products so long as the
us dollar continues generally strong compared to other foreign currencies
this trend is likely to continue

international

         for foreign sales export sales and an allocation of the assets of the
companys continuing operations see note 15 to the consolidated financial
statements on page 36 of the 2000 annual report which is incorporated herein by
reference

         although international operations are subject to certain risks such as
price and exchange rate fluctuations and foreign governmental restrictions
dover intends to increase its expansion into foreign markets

         the countries where most of dovers foreign subsidiaries and affiliates
are based are france germany great britain the netherlands sweden and
switzerland

environmental matters

         dover believes its operations generally are in substantial compliance
with applicable regulations in a few instances particular plants and
businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with
governmental agencies relating to the discharge or potential discharge of
regulated substances where necessary these matters have been addressed with
specific consent orders to achieve compliance dover believes that continued
compliance will not have any material impact on the companys financial position
going forward and will not require significant capital expenditures

         the facilities are generally well maintained and suitable for the
operations conducted while some capacity limitations arose during 2000 in the
technologies segment with current expansion programs the productive capacity of
the companys plants is generally adequate for current needs




item 3  legal proceedings

         dover is party to a number of legal proceedings arising out of the
normal course of its businesses in general most claims arose in connection
with activities of its elevator segment operations and certain of its other
businesses which make products used by the public in connection with the sale
of dover elevator which closed on january 5 1999 all liabilities of dover
elevator were transferred to the buyer who has given the company an appropriate
indemnity

         dover is continuously involved with an examination by the internal
revenue service the irs of the companys federal income tax returns the
company and the irs have settled tax years through 1989 and during 2000 the
irs completed its examination of the companys 1996 and 1997 federal income tax
returns the company expects to resolve open years 19901995 in the near
future all within the amounts paid andor reserved for these liabilities the
irs is currently examining the companys 1998 and 1999 federal income tax
returns additionally the company routinely is involved in state and local
income tax audits and on occasion foreign jurisdiction tax audits

         based on insurance availability established reserves and periodic
reviews of these matters management is of the opinion that the ultimate
resolution of current pending claims and known contingencies should not have a
material adverse effect on the financial position results of operations or cash
flows of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

         interest rates

         the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to the fair value of longterm fixed interest rate debt
commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents generally the
fair market value of fixedinterest rate debt will increase as interest rates
fall and decrease as interest rates rise a 65 basis point increase in interest
rates 10 of the companys longterm debt interest rate would have an
immaterial effect on the fair value of the companys longterm debt commercial
paper borrowings under revolving credit facilities are at variable interest
rates and have maturities of three months or less a 55 basis point increase in
the interest rates 10 of the companys weighted average commercial paper
interest rate on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on
the companys pretax earnings all highly liquid investments including highly
liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less are considered cash equivalents the company places its investments in
cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of
exposure to any one issuer a 54 basis point decrease in interest rates 10 of
the companys weighted average interest rate would have an immaterial impact on
the companys pretax earnings the company does not enter into derivative
financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative
purposes
