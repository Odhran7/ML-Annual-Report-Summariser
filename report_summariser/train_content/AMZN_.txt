 item 1a risk factors tableend

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows liquidity and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in the risk factors below the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen circumstances developments or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below 

business and industry risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors across geographies including crossborder competition and in different industries including physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail ecommerce services web and infrastructure computing services electronic devices digital content advertising grocery and transportation and logistics services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition continues to intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices continue to increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesser known businesses to compete against us as a result of competition our product and service offerings may not be successful we may fail to gain or may lose business and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings these offerings which can present new and difficult technology challenges may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may not meet our expectations and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off in addition our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies which could harm our business or damage our reputation 

our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

• local economic and political conditions 

• government regulation such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership 

• restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internetfriendly legal systems local laws lack of legal 

precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices 

• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions 

• limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure 

• shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow 

• laws and regulations regarding privacy data use data protection data security network security consumer protection payments advertising and restrictions on pricing or discounts 

• lower levels of use of the internet 

• lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the us 

• lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk 

• difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences 

• different employeeemployer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable us and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties 

• laws and policies of the us and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and 

• geopolitical events including war and terrorism 

as international physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail cloud services and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names the inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirements we provide certain technology services in china through contractual relationships with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are thirdparty sellers on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc and india may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory licensing or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties having licenses revoked or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely 

the variability in our retail business places increased strain on our operations 

demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons including as a result of seasonality promotions product launches or unforeseeable events such as in response to natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change or geopolitical events for example we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth when we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could materially reduce profitability we regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable 

to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

we are impacted by fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies when these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results 

we face risks related to adequately protecting our intellectual property rights and being accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or significant payments for damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to these fluctuations operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies such as british pounds canadian dollars euros and 

japanese yen when the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

operating risks 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses the complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and our expansion increases these factors failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following 

• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ demands 

• our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers 

• our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders 

• the introduction of competitive stores websites products services price decreases or improvements 

• changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet ecommerce electronic devices and web services including outside the us 

• timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure 

• the success of our geographic service and product line expansions 

• the extent to which we finance and the terms of any such financing for our current operations and future growth 

• the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

• variations in the mix of products and services we sell 

• variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns 

• the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery continue to reduce prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers 

• factors affecting our reputation or brand image including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments whether related to sustainability customers employees or other topics 

• the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories 

• increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline energy products commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products and technology infrastructure products 

• constrained labor markets which increase our payroll costs 

• the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services 

• our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due 

• the extent to which new and existing technologies or industry trends restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings 

• the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events and 

• disruptions from natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities labor or trade disputes and similar events 

we face risks related to successfully optimizing and operating our fulfillment network and data centers 

failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity service interruptions increased costs and impairment charges any of which could materially harm our business as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers for example productivity across our fulfillment network currently is being affected by global supply chain constraints and constrained labor markets which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire train and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like we are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time and if successful those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility which could adversely affect our fulfillment network operating efficiency 

under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers an inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems staffing limitations or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

because we collect process store and transmit large amounts of data including confidential sensitive proprietary and business and personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss theft misuse or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology products and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation liability or regulatory action including under laws related to privacy data use data protection data security network security and consumer protection deter customers or sellers from using our stores products and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation we use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services steps we take to add software and hardware upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been or in the future could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities computer viruses physical or electronic breakins operational failures and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

the loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to hire and retain highly skilled and other key personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel including our president and ceo we do not have “key person” life insurance policies we also rely on other highly skilled personnel competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate as well as senior management has historically been intense for example we experience significant competition in the technology industry particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff in addition changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees the failure to successfully transition key roles or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including content and technology licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or for other reasons may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws regulations contractual terms intellectual property rights of others or our supply chain standards as well as products or practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous could expose us to claims damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships expose us to risks 

we provide physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail cloud services and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore when the other company’s offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships create additional risks such as 

• disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses 

• impairment of other relationships 

• variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and 

• difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements 

our business suffers when we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

• disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses 

• problems retaining key personnel 

• additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested 

• the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions 

• the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations 

• the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes or at all 

• the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration 

• the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting financial reporting management information and data security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented 

• losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financial results 

• for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information the dependence on the investee’s accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes 

• the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company 

• the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and 

• for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply failure to comply with these rules or requirements as well as any breach compromise or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures maintaining or processing data and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy data use data protection data security network security consumer protection and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

• changes in interest rates 

• conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in 

• quarterly variations in operating results 

• fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internetrelated companies in particular 

• changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels 

• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts 

• changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public 

• changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other ecommerce or technology companies and 

• transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation 

volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

legal and regulatory risks 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail digital content web services electronic devices advertising artificial intelligence technologies and services and other products and services that we offer or sell these regulations and laws cover taxation privacy data use data protection data security network security consumer protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition employment trade and protectionist measures web services the provision of online payment services registration licensing and information reporting 

requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites health safety and sanitation standards the characteristics legality and quality of products and services product labeling the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems healthcare and other matters it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel privacy data use data protection data security network security and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet ecommerce digital content web services electronic devices advertising and artificial intelligence technologies and services a large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations and the extent nature and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand we are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws regulations or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations for example we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules including aspects of amazon’s european marketplace for sellers particularly with respect to use of data fulfillment services and featured offers unfavorable regulations laws decisions or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations or inquiries investigations or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services increase our cost of doing business require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business damage our reputation impede our growth or otherwise have a material effect on our operations the media political and regulatory scrutiny we face which may continue to increase amplifies these risks 

claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims litigation reviews investigations and other proceedings including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities involving a wide range of issues including patent and other intellectual property matters taxes labor and employment competition and antitrust privacy data use data protection data security network security consumer protection commercial disputes goods and services offered by us and by third parties and other matters the number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products services and operations have become more complex and available to and used by more people any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs disruption of our operations diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors the outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes until the final resolution of such matters we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings including as a result of a settlement could involve licenses sanctions consent decrees or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies damaging our reputation or otherwise having a material effect on our operations 

we are subject to product liability claims when people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacture 

some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and can require product recalls or other actions third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we face additional tax liabilities and collection obligations 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenuebased taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services these include new obligations to collect sales 

consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations for example nonus jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies in some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date 

our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense assets and liabilities 

we are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals 

we are subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval andor provide for termination by the government at any time without cause

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending inflation labor market and global supply chain constraints world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services the amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products and services sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income or other taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management variability in demand the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity in addition the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic amplify many of these risks these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1a of part i “risk factors” 

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers the products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales we seek to increase unit sales across our stores through increased product selection across numerous product categories we also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment advertising publishing and digital content subscriptions 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection producing original content increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust see “results of operations — nongaap financial measures” below for additional information on our nongaap free cash flows financial measures 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 1  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales 

1 the operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days 

by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power data storage and analytics improved wireless connectivity and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve users’ experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in aws which offers a broad set of ondemand technology services including compute storage database analytics and machine learning and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes we are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices 

we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 518 million and 523 million as of december 31 2020 and 2021 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item addressed above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business accounting policies and supplemental disclosures” 

our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business accounting policies and supplemental disclosures” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2021 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 370 million 

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets 

our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions in addition a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows in millions 



our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 844 billion and 960 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2021 amounts held in foreign currencies were 235 billion and 227 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2021 and were primarily british pounds euros japanese yen and canadian dollars 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 661 billion and 463 billion in 2020 and 2021 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the decrease in operating cash flow in 2021 compared to the prior year was 

primarily due to changes in working capital partially offset by the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including variability in demand inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements incentives received from property and equipment vendors proceeds from asset sales cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in investing activities was 596 billion and 582 billion in 2020 and 2021 with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash capital expenditures were 350 billion and 554 billion in 2020 and 2021 which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws which investments we expect to continue over time we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 23 billion and 20 billion in 2020 and 2021 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 11 billion and 63 billion in 2020 and 2021 cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from shortterm debt and other and longtermdebt of 173 billion and 270 billion in 2020 and 2021 cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of shortterm debt and other longterm debt finance leases and financing obligations of 184 billion and 207 billion in 2020 and 2021 property and equipment acquired under finance leases was 116 billion and 71 billion in 2020 and 2021 reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws 

we had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility 725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs and 803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” as of december 31 2021 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 6 — debt” for additional information 

as of december 31 2021 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were 76 billion we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts 

tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our us taxable income us tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021 cash taxes paid net of refunds were 17 billion and 37 billion for 2020 and 2021 effective january 1 2022 research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for us tax purposes which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay 

as of december 31 2020 and 2021 restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 257 million and 260 million see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 6 — debt” and “financial statements and supplementary data — note 7 — commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets additionally we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders including for inventory and capital expenditures that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months these purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain finance and operating lease arrangements enter into financing obligations repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position we expect to fund the acquisition of mgm holdings inc with cash on hand 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into three segments north america international and aws these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 10 — segment information” 

overview 

as reflected in the discussion below ongoing direct and indirect impacts of the covid19 pandemic and actions taken in response to them had varying effects on our 2021 results of operations although some effects including customer demand are mitigating or becoming more difficult to isolate or quantify moreover it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns supply chain disruptions and labor availability and costs or the impact of other indirect factors that may be attributable to the pandemic and the extent to which these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations however we expect our net sales growth rate to decelerate in q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in q1 2021 in addition these direct and indirect factors can make it difficult to isolate and quantify the portion of our costs that are a direct result of the pandemic and costs arising from factors that may have been influenced by the pandemic including increased wage rates and incentives increased carrier rates and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from constrained labor markets and global supply chain constraints we expect these factors and their effects on our operations to continue into q1 2022 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales primarily represent thirdparty seller fees which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees aws sales advertising services amazon prime membership fees and certain digital content subscriptions net sales information is as follows in millions 



sales increased 22 in 2021 compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 14 billion and 38 billion for 2020 and 2021 for a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased 18 in 2021 compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers and increased demand partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints we expect our north america sales growth rate to decelerate in q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in q1 2021 

international sales increased 22 in 2021 compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers and increased demand partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints we expect our international sales growth rate to decelerate in q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in q1 2021 changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 17 billion and 30 billion in 2020 and 2021 

aws sales increased 37 in 2021 compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage partially offset by pricing changes pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers 

operating income loss 

operating income loss by segment is as follows in millions 



operating income was 229 billion and 249 billion for 2020 and 2021 we believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

the decrease in north america operating income in absolute dollars in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network increased wage rates and incentives increased carrier rates and fulfillment network inefficiencies and growth in certain operating expenses including marketing partially offset by increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 8 million and 88 million for 2020 and 2021 

the international operating loss in 2021 as compared to the operating income in the prior year is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network increased wage rates and incentives and increased carrier rates and growth in certain operating expenses including marketing partially offset by increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income loss by 411 million and 435 million for 2020 and 2021 

the increase in aws operating income in absolute dollars in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity partially offset by increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth and reduced prices for our customers changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 30 million and 372 million for 2020 and 2021 

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses is as follows in millions   



cost of sales 

cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products inbound and outbound shipping costs including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music 

the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales costs from expanding our fulfillment network as well as increased carrier rates increased wage rates and incentives and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints 

shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers shipping costs which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs were 611 billion and 767 billion in 2020 and 2021 we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we use more expensive shipping methods including faster delivery and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as “technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “fulfillment” aws costs are primarily classified as “technology and 

content” fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent to which third party sellers utilize fulfillment by amazon services timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels increased wage rates and incentives and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints and costs from expanding our fulfillment network 

we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements 

technology and content 

technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support aws and other amazon businesses collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers 

we seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure these costs are allocated to segments based on usage the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings we expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2022 due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment which will primarily impact our aws segment see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business accounting policies and supplemental disclosures — use of estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment 

marketing 

marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities including sales commissions related to aws we direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels such as our sponsored search social and online advertising third party customer referrals television advertising and other initiatives our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs 

the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher marketing spend which was constrained in 2020 in response to covid19 and increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities 

while costs associated with amazon prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 75 million and 62 million during 2020 and 2021 and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in 2020 offset by a lease impairment in 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 555 million and 448 million during 2020 and 2021 we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

interest expense was 16 billion and 18 billion in 2020 and 2021 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases 

our longterm lease liabilities were 526 billion and 677 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2021 our longterm debt was 318 billion and 487 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2021 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 4 — leases and note 6 — debt” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 24 billion and 146 billion during 2020 and 2021 the primary components of other income expense net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments equity warrant valuations and foreign currency included in other income expense net in 2021 is a valuation gain of 118 billion from our equity securities of rivian automotive inc which completed an initial public offering in november 2021 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate intercompany transactions the applicability of special tax regimes changes in how we do business acquisitions investments auditrelated developments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized in addition we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 29 billion and 48 billion in 2020 and 2021 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 9 — income taxes” for additional information 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales and incentives” the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2020 and 2021 in millions 



free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance leases” and “principal repayments of financing obligations” principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2020 and 2021 in millions 



free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases which is included in “property and equipment acquired under finance leases” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities which is included in “principal repayments of finance leases” and “principal repayments of financing obligations” all other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property in this measure equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash which is not the case as these assets have been leased the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2020 and 2021 in millions 



 

1 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2021 this amount relates to equipment included in “property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of 11588 million and 7061 million 

2 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2021 this amount relates to property included in “principal repayments of finance leases” of 10642 million and 11163 million 

all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

effect of foreign exchange rates 

information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our net sales operating expenses and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period the effect on our net sales operating expenses and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions 



 

1 represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results 

2 represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results 

guidance 

we provided guidance on february 3 2022 in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as set forth below these forwardlooking statements reflect amazoncom’s expectations as of february 3 2022 and are subject to substantial uncertainty our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the covid19 pandemic fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending inflation labor market and global supply chain constraints world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services as well as those outlined in item 1a of part i “risk factors” this guidance reflects our estimates as of february 3 2022 regarding the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above 

first quarter 2022 guidance 

• net sales are expected to be between 1120 billion and 1170 billion or to grow between 3 and 8 compared with first quarter 2021 this guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates 

• operating income is expected to be between 30 billion and 60 billion compared with 89 billion in first quarter 2021 this guidance includes approximately 10 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on january 1 2022 

• this guidance assumes among other things that no additional business acquisitions restructurings or legal settlements are concluded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates the following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2021 in millions except percentages 



as of december 31 2021 we had longterm debt with a face value of 506 billion including the current portion primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 6 — debt” for additional information 

foreign exchange risk 

during 2021 net sales from our international segment accounted for 27 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationallyfocused stores including within canada and mexico which are included in our north america segment are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused stores and aws are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year international segment net sales increased by 30 billion in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2021 of 227 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 11 billion 23 billion and 45 billion fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2021 an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of 285 million 575 million and 11 billion recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

equity investment risk 

as of december 31 2021 our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was 223 billion our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies which primarily relate to rivian automotive inc represent 203 billion of our investments as of december 31 2021 and are recorded at fair value which is subject to market price volatility we record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business accounting policies and supplemental disclosures” for additional information

competition continues to intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices continue to increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesser known businesses to compete against us as a result of competition our product and service offerings may not be successful we may fail to gain or may lose business and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings these offerings which can present new and difficult technology challenges may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may not meet our expectations and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off 

our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

• local economic and political conditions 

• government regulation such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership 

• restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internetfriendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices 

• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions 

• limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure 

• shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow 

• laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection data security network security consumer protection payments advertising and restrictions on pricing or discounts 

• lower levels of use of the internet 

• lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the us 

• lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk 

• difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences 

• different employeeemployer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable us and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties 

• laws and policies of the us and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and 

• geopolitical events including war and terrorism 

as international physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names the inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirements we provide certain technology services in china through contractual relationships with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are thirdparty sellers on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc and india may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory licensing or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties having licenses revoked or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely 

the variability in our retail business places increased strain on our operations 

demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons including as a result of seasonality promotions product launches or unforeseeable events such as in response to natural or manmade disasters extreme weather or geopolitical events for example we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth when we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could materially reduce profitability we regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

we are impacted by fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies when these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results 

we face risks related to adequately protecting our intellectual property rights and being accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or significant payments for damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to these fluctuations operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including euros british pounds and japanese yen when the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

operating risks 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses the complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and our expansion increases these factors failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following 

• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ demands 

• our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers 

• our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders 

• the introduction of competitive stores websites products services price decreases or improvements 

• changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet ecommerce electronic devices and web services including outside the us 

• timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure 

• the success of our geographic service and product line expansions 

• the extent to which we finance and the terms of any such financing for our current operations and future growth 

• the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

• variations in the mix of products and services we sell 

• variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns 

• the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery continue to reduce prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers 

• factors affecting our reputation or brand image 

• the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories 

• increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products 

• the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services 

• our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due 

• the extent to which new and existing technologies or industry trends restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings 

• the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events and 

• disruptions from natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities labor or trade disputes and similar events 

we face risks related to successfully optimizing and operating our fulfillment network and data centers 

failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity increased costs and impairment charges any of which could materially harm our business as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers the inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

because we collect process store and transmit large amounts of data including confidential sensitive proprietary and business and personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss theft misuse or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology products and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation liability or regulatory action including under laws related to privacy data protection data security network security and consumer protection deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation we use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services steps we take to add software and hardware upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been or in the future could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

the loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to hire and retain highly skilled and other key personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies we also rely on other highly skilled personnel competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including content and technology licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws regulations contractual terms intellectual property rights of others or our supply chain standards as well as products or practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous could expose us to claims damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships expose us to risks 

we provide physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore when the other company’s offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

• disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses 

• impairment of other relationships 

• variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and 

• difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements 

our business suffers when we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

• disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses 

• problems retaining key personnel 

• additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested 

• the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions 

• the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations 

• the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes or at all 

• the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration 

• the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting financial reporting management information and data security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented 

• losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financial results 

• for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part the dependence on the investee’s accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes 

• the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company 

• the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and 

• for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication 

processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply failure to comply with these rules or requirements as well as any breach compromise or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures maintaining or processing data and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy data protection data security network security consumer protection and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

• changes in interest rates 

• conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in 

• quarterly variations in operating results

• changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other ecommerce or technology companies and 

• transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation 

volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

legal and regulatory risks 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail digital content web services electronic devices advertising artificial intelligence technologies and services and other products and services that we offer or sell these regulations and laws cover taxation privacy data protection data security network security consumer protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition employment trade and protectionist measures web services the provision of online payment services registration licensing and information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites health safety and sanitation standards the characteristics legality and quality of products and services product labeling the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems and other matters it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel privacy data protection data security network security and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet ecommerce digital content web services electronic devices advertising and artificial 

intelligence technologies and services a large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations and the extent nature and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand we are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws regulations or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations for example a number of regulators have opened investigations to assess whether aspects of our operations violate competition rules unfavorable regulations laws decisions or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations or inquiries investigations or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services increase our cost of doing business require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business damage our reputation impede our growth or otherwise have a material effect on our operations 

claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims litigation reviews investigations and other proceedings including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities involving a wide range of issues including patent and other intellectual property matters taxes labor and employment competition and antitrust privacy data protection data security network security consumer protection commercial disputes goods and services offered by us and by third parties and other matters the number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products services and operations have become more complex and available to and used by more people any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs disruption of our operations diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors the outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes until the final resolution of such matters we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings including as a result of a settlement could involve licenses sanctions consent decrees or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies damaging our reputation or otherwise having a material effect on our operations 

we are subject to product liability claims when people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacture 

some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and can require product recalls or other actions third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we face additional tax liabilities and collection obligations 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenuebased taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services these include new obligations to collect sales consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations for example the european union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies in some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date 

our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense assets and liabilities 

we are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals 

we are subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval andor provide for termination by the government at any time without cause

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales we seek to increase unit sales across our stores through increased product selection across numerous product categories we also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment advertising publishing and digital content subscriptions 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection producing original content increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust see “results of operations — nongaap financial measures” below for additional information on our nongaap free cash flows financial measures 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 1  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales 

1 the operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days 

by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power data storage and analytics improved wireless connectivity and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve users’ experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in aws which offers a broad set of ondemand technology services including compute storage database analytics and machine learning and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes we are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices 

we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 512 million and 518 million as of december 31 2019 and 2020 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item addressed above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business accounting policies and supplemental disclosures” 

our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

effects of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses as well as those of our customers suppliers and thirdparty sellers to serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics transportation supply chain purchasing and thirdparty seller processes beginning in q1 2020 we made numerous process updates across our operations worldwide and adapted our fulfillment network to implement employee and customer safety measures such as enhanced cleaning and physical distancing personal protective gear disinfectant spraying and temperature checks since february 2020 we have hired over 400000 fulltime and parttime employees to increase our fulfillment network capacity we incurred approximately 40 billion in covid19 related costs in q4 2020 for a total of more than 115 billion during 2020 we will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving federal state and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers and communities 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business accounting policies and supplemental disclosures” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2020 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 270 million 

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic political and other conditions such as the covid19 pandemic and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets 

our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions in addition a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows in millions 

  



our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 550 billion and 844 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2020 amounts held in foreign currencies were 153 billion and 235 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2020 and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 385 billion and 661 billion in 2019 and 2020 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase in operating cash flow in 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including variability in demand inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements incentives received from property and equipment vendors proceeds from asset sales cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in investing activities was 243 billion and 596 billion in 2019 and 2020 with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities cash capital expenditures were 127 billion and 350 billion in 2019 and 2020 which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws which investments we expect to continue over time we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 25 billion and 23 billion in 2019 and 2020 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 101 billion and 11 billion in 2019 and 2020 cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds of shortterm debt and other and longtermdebt of 23 billion and 173 billion in 2019 and 2020 cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of shortterm debt and other longterm debt finance leases and financing obligations of 123 billion and 184 billion in 2019 and 2020 property and equipment acquired under finance leases was 137 billion and 116 billion in 2019 and 2020 reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws 

we had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” 725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program the “commercial paper program” and 338 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” as of december 31 2020 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 6 — debt” for additional information 

as of december 31 2020 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were 172 billion we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts 

tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our us taxable income and all remaining federal tax credits which were primarily related to the us federal research and development credit reduced our federal tax liability in 2020 us tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election for 2020 cash taxes paid net of refunds were 881 million and 17 billion for 2019 and 2020 we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis in connection with the european commission’s october 2017 decision against us on state aid luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the 

european commission’s decision of approximately €250 million that we deposited into escrow in march 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals 

as of december 31 2019 and 2020 restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 321 million and 257 million see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 7 — commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets additionally purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 266 billion as of december 31 2020 these purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain finance and operating lease arrangements enter into financing obligations repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have caused significant market volatility these disruptions can contribute to defaults in our accounts receivable affect asset valuations resulting in impairment charges and affect the availability of lease and financing credit as well as other segments of the credit markets we have utilized a range of financing methods to fund our operations and capital expenditures and expect to continue to maintain financing flexibility in the current market conditions however due to the rapidly evolving global situation it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into three segments north america international and aws these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 10 — segment information” 

effects of covid19 

as reflected in the discussion below the impact of the covid19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it had varying effects on our 2020 results of operations higher net sales in the north america and international segments reflect increased demand particularly as people are staying at home including for household staples and other essential and home products partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints other effects in the north america and international segments include increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the impact of lower productivity increased employee hiring and benefits and costs to maintain safe workplaces 

we expect the effects of fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints elevated collection risk in our accounts receivable and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue into all or portions of q1 2021 however it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic including any recurrence the actions taken in response to the pandemic the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns or other impacts of the pandemic and whether these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales primarily represent thirdparty seller fees which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees aws sales advertising services amazon prime membership fees and certain digital content subscriptions net sales information is as follows in millions 



sales increased 38 in 2020 compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 26 billion and 14 billion for 2019 and 2020 for a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased 38 in 2020 compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers and increased demand including for household staples and other essential and home products partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints 

international sales increased 40 in 2020 compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers and increased demand including for household staples and other essential and home products partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 24 billion and 17 billion in 2019 and 2020 

aws sales increased 30 in 2020 compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage partially offset by pricing changes pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers 

operating income loss 

operating income loss by segment is as follows in millions 



operating income was 145 billion and 229 billion for 2019 and 2020 we believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

the increase in north america operating income in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to covid19 we expect north america operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least q1 2021 by covid19 related costs changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 23 million and 8 million for 2019 and 2020 

the international operating income in 2020 as compared to the operating loss in the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to covid19 we expect international operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least q1 2021 by covid19 related costs changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income loss by 116 million and 411 million for 2019 and 2020 

the increase in aws operating income in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth and reduced prices for our customers changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 273 million and 30 million for 2019 and 2020 

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses is as follows in millions 

  



cost of sales 

cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products inbound and outbound shipping costs including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music 

the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales we expect cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least q1 2021 by covid19 related costs 

shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers shipping costs which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs were 379 billion and 611 billion in 2019 and 2020 we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we use more expensive shipping methods including faster delivery and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as “technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “fulfillment” aws costs are primarily classified as “technology and content” fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent to which third party sellers utilize fulfillment by amazon services timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels costs from expanding our fulfillment network and the covid19 related impact of lower productivity increased employee hiring and benefits and costs to maintain safe workplaces we expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least q1 2021 by covid19 related costs 

we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements 

technology and content 

technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support aws and other amazon businesses collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers 

we seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure these costs are allocated to segments based on usage the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business accounting policies and supplemental disclosures — use of estimates” for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers 

marketing 

marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities including sales commissions related to aws we direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels such as our sponsored search third party customer referrals social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs 

the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of covid19 

while costs associated with amazon prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 201 million and 75 million during 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in q4 2020 offset by a lease impairment in q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 832 million and 555 million during 2019 and 2020 we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

interest expense was 16 billion in 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases 

our longterm lease liabilities were 398 billion and 526 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2020 our longterm debt was 234 billion and 318 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2020 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 4 — leases and note 6 — debt” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 203 million and 24 billion during 2019 and 2020 the primary components of other income expense net are related to equity warrant valuations equity securities valuations and adjustments and foreign currency 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate intercompany transactions the applicability of special tax regimes changes in how we do business acquisitions investments auditrelated developments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower in addition we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions and the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future income more challenging 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 24 billion and 29 billion in 2019 and 2020 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 9 — income taxes” for additional information 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales and incentives” the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2019 and 2020 in millions 



free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance leases” and “principal repayments of financing obligations” principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2019 and 2020 in millions 



free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases which is included in “property and equipment acquired under finance leases” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities which is included in “principal repayments of finance leases” and “principal repayments of financing obligations” all other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property in this measure equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash which is not the case as these assets have been leased the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2019 and 2020 in millions 



 

1 for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2020 this amount relates to equipment included in “property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of 13723 million and 11588 million 

2 for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2020 this amount relates to property included in “principal repayments of finance leases” of 9628 million and 10642 million 

all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

effect of foreign exchange rates 

information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our net sales operating expenses and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods the effect on our net sales operating expenses and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions 



  

1 represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results

we provided guidance on february 2 2021 in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as set forth below these forwardlooking statements reflect amazoncom’s expectations as of february 2 2021 and are subject to substantial uncertainty our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services as well as those outlined in item 1a of part i “risk factors” this guidance reflects our estimates as of february 2 2021 regarding the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations including those discussed above and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control including the duration and scope of the pandemic including any recurrence actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures our ability to continue operations in affected areas and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers creditors and thirdparty sellers all of which are uncertain this guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021 to date and the additional assumptions set forth below however it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of 2021 or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations 

first quarter 2021 guidance 

• net sales are expected to be between 1000 billion and 1060 billion or to grow between 33 and 40 compared with first quarter 2020 this guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange rates 

• operating income is expected to be between 30 billion and 65 billion compared with 40 billion in first quarter 2020 this guidance assumes approximately 20 billion of costs related to covid19 

• this guidance assumes among other things that no additional business acquisitions investments restructurings or legal settlements are concluded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates the following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2020 in millions except percentages 

  



as of december 31 2020 we had longterm debt with a face value of 332 billion including the current portion primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 6 — debt” for additional information 

foreign exchange risk 

during 2020 net sales from our international segment accounted for 27 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationallyfocused stores including within canada and mexico which are included in our north america segment are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused stores and aws are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year international segment net sales increased by 17 billion in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2020 of 235 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 12 billion 24 billion and 47 billion fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2020 an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of 245 million 485 million and 970 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

equity investment risk 

as of december 31 2020 our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was 69 billion our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent 32 billion of our investments as of december 31 2020 and are recorded at fair value which is subject to market price volatility we assess our equity investments in private companies for impairment valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

risk factors 

tableend

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows liquidity and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations in addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors across geographies including crossborder competition and in different industries including physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail ecommerce services web and infrastructure computing services electronic devices digital content advertising grocery and transportation and logistics services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition continues to intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices continue to increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesser known businesses to compete against us as a result of competition our product and service offerings may not be successful we may fail to gain or may lose business and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses the complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and our expansion increases these factors failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings these offerings which can present new and difficult technology challenges may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may not meet our expectations and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off 

we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following 



 our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 



 as international physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names the inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirements we provide certain technology services in china through contractual relationships with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are thirdparty sellers on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc and india may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory licensing or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties having licenses revoked or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely 

we face risks related to successfully optimizing and operating our fulfillment network and data centers 

failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity increased costs and impairment charges any of which could materially harm our business as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers the inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events 

the seasonality of our retail business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth when we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could materially reduce profitability we regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships expose us to risks 

we provide physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore when the other company’s offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 our business suffers when we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 



 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to these fluctuations operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds euros and japanese yen when the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to hire and retain highly skilled and other key personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies we also rely on other highly skilled personnel competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

because we collect process store and transmit large amounts of data including confidential sensitive proprietary and business and personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss theft misuse or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology products and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation regulatory action including under privacy or data protection laws and potential liability for us deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation we use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and 

although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent such incidents including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services steps we take to add software and hardware upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been or in the future could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we face risks related to adequately protecting our intellectual property rights and being accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or significant payments for damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail digital content web services electronic devices artificial intelligence technologies and services and other products and services that we offer or sell these regulations and laws cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection employment trade and protectionist measures web services the provision of online payment services registration licensing and information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites health safety and sanitation standards the characteristics legality and quality of products and services product labeling the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems and other matters it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel data protection and personal privacy apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet ecommerce digital content web services electronic devices and artificial intelligence technologies and services a large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations and the extent nature and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand we are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws regulations or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations for example the european commission announced that it has opened an investigation to assess whether aspects of our operations with marketplace sellers violate eu competition rules unfavorable regulations laws decisions or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations or inquiries investigations or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services increase our cost of doing business require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business damage our reputation impede our growth or otherwise have a material effect on our operations 

claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims litigation reviews investigations and other proceedings including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities involving a wide range of issues including patent and other intellectual property matters taxes labor and employment competition and antitrust privacy and data protection consumer protection commercial disputes goods and services offered by us and by third parties and other matters the number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products services and operations have become more complex and available to and used by more people any of these types of 

proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs disruption of our operations diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors the outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes until the final resolution of such matters we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings including as a result of a settlement could involve licenses sanctions consent decrees or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies damaging our reputation or otherwise having a material effect on our operations 

we face additional tax liabilities and collection obligations 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenuebased taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services these include new obligations to collect sales consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations for example the european union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies in some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date 

our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example the legislation known as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “us tax act” requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the us tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the us tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including content and technology licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits decisions by our current suppliers to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws regulations contractual 

terms intellectual property rights of others or our supply chain standards as well as products or practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous could expose us to claims damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we are subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition some of these contracts provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we are subject to product liability claims when people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacture 

some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and can require product recalls or other actions third parties who sell products using our services and stores increase our exposure to product liability claims such as when these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply failure to comply with these rules or requirements as well as any breach compromise or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures maintaining or processing data and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we are impacted by fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling 

goods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies when these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services the amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products and services sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income or other taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity in addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1a of part i “risk factors” 

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales we seek to increase unit sales across our stores through increased product selection across numerous product categories we also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment advertising publishing and digital content subscriptions 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows 1  free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection producing original content increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

 



because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the advances of wireless connectivity and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes 

we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 507 million and 512 million as of december 31 2018 and 2019  

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item addressed above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” 

our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2017 in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 



critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2019  we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 230 million  

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions in addition a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the us tax reform legislation commonly known as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “us tax act” finally foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the us tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

the us tax act significantly changed how the us taxes corporations the us tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the us tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the us tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” is as follows in millions 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 413 billion and 550 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2019  amounts held in foreign currencies were 138 billion and 153 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2019  and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 307 billion and 385 billion in 2018 and 2019  our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase in operating cash flow in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation cash provided by used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements incentives received from property and equipment vendors proceeds from asset sales cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in investing activities was 124 billion and 243 billion in 2018 and 2019  with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities cash capital expenditures were 113 billion  and 127 billion in 2018 and 2019  which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 22 billion and 25 billion in 2018 and 2019  

cash provided by used in financing activities was 77 billion and 101 billion in 2018 and 2019  cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations and repayments of longterm debt and other and were 85 billion and 123 billion in 2018 and 2019  property and equipment acquired under finance leases was 106 billion and 137 billion in 2018 and 2019  with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws which investments we expect to continue over time 

we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program the “commercial paper program” or unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” and 740 million of borrowings outstanding under our 740 million secured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” as of december 31 2019  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 6 — debt” for additional information 

in 2018 and 2019  we recorded net tax provisions of 12 billion and 24 billion  certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to us taxation under the us tax act which also repeals us taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign 

subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts as of december 31 2019  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 134 billion  

tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our us taxable income the us tax act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 cash taxes paid net of refunds were 12 billion and 881 million for 2018 and 2019  as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 17 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit as we utilize our federal tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis in connection with the european commission’s october 2017 decision against us on state aid luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the european commission’s decision of approximately €250 million  that we deposited into escrow in march 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases amounts due to thirdparty sellers in certain jurisdictions debt and standby and trade letters of credit to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash which is classified within “accounts receivable net and other” and “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2018 and 2019  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 426 million and 321 million  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 7 — commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets additionally purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 157 billion as of december 31 2019  these purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain finance and operating lease arrangements enter into financing obligations repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into three segments north america international and aws these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 10 — segment information” 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales primarily represent thirdparty seller fees which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees aws sales amazon prime membership fees advertising services and certain digital content subscriptions net sales information is as follows in millions 



sales increased 20 in 2019  compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 13 billion and 26 billion for 2018 and 2019  for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased 21 in 2019  compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers increased instock inventory availability and increased selection 

international sales increased 13 in 2019  compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers increased instock inventory availability and increased selection changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 13 billion and 24 billion in 2018 and 2019  

aws sales increased 37  in 2019  compared to the prior year the sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage partially offset by pricing changes pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers 

  

operating income loss 

operating income loss by segment is as follows in millions 



operating income was 124 billion and 145 billion for 2018 and 2019  we believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

the decrease in north america operating income in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased shipping costs and marketing expense partially offset by increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 17 million and 23 million for 2018 and 2019  

the decrease in international operating loss in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by increased marketing expense changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by 258 million and 116 million for 2018 and 2019  

the increase in aws operating income in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 49 million and 273 million for 2018 and 2019  

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses is as follows in millions 

  

cost of sales 

cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products inbound and outbound shipping costs including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music 

the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales 

shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers shipping costs which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs were 277 billion and 379 billion in 2018 and 2019  we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods including faster delivery and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as “technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment aws costs are primarily classified as “technology and content” fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent to which third party sellers utilize fulfillment by amazon services timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher payment processing costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network which includes physical stores 

we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements 

technology and content 

technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support aws and other amazon businesses collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers 

we seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure these costs are allocated to segments based on usage the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings we expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers which will impact each of our segments see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies — use of estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful life of our servers 

marketing 

marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities including sales commissions related to aws we direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels such as our sponsored search third party customer referrals social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs 

the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 296 million and 201 million during 2018 and 2019  and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 440 million and 832 million during 2018 and 2019  we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

interest expense was 14 billion and 16 billion in 2018 and 2019  the increase is primarily related to finance leases 

our longterm lease liabilities were 97 billion and 398 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2019  our longterm debt was 235 billion and 234 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2019  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 4 — leases and note 6 — debt” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 183 million and 203 million during 2018 and 2019  the primary components of other income expense net are related to equity securities and warrant valuations and foreign currency 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate intercompany transactions the applicability of special tax regimes changes in how we do business acquisitions investments auditrelated developments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 12 billion and 24 billion in 2018 and 2019  our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in us pretax income a decline in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the onetime provisional tax benefit of the us tax act recognized in 2018 

tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our us taxable income the us tax act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 17 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 9 — income taxes” for additional information 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations we adopted new lease accounting guidance on january 1 2019 without retrospectively adjusting prior periods as a result the line items used in our calculation of measures of free cash flows have changed see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales and incentives” the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2018 and 2019 in millions 



free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance leases” and “principal repayments of financing obligations” principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2018 and 2019 in millions 



 

1 amounts for 2018 have not been retrospectively adjusted 

free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations 

free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases which is included in “property and equipment acquired under finance leases” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities which is included in “principal repayments of finance leases” and “principal repayments of financing obligations” all other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property in this measure equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash which is not the case as these assets have been leased the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2018 and 2019 in millions 



 

 

all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

effect of foreign exchange rates 

information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our net sales operating expenses and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods the effect on our net sales operating expenses and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2019 in millions except percentages 

  

as of december 31 2019  we had 248 billion of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt in millions 



based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our total debt was 278 billion as of december 31 2019  

foreign exchange risk 

during 2019  net sales from our international segment accounted for 27 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationallyfocused stores including within canada and mexico which are included in our north america segment are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused stores and aws are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year international segment net sales decreased by 24 billion in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2019  of 153 billion  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 765 million  15 billion  and 31 billion  fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2019  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 195 million  385 million  and 775 million  recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

equity investment risk 

as of december 31 2019  our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was 33 billion  our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent 679 million of our investments as of december 31 2019  and are recorded at fair value which is subject to market price volatility we perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment if this assessment indicates that an impairment exists we estimate the fair value of the investment and if the fair value is less than carrying value we write down the investment to fair value our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail ecommerce services digital content and electronic devices web and infrastructure computing services and transportation and logistics services and across geographies including crossborder competition some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 



 our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 



 as international physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals in addition we provide certain technology services in china in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are thirdparty sellers on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc and india are actively considering changes in their foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions such as our acquisition of whole foods market inc create risks such as 



 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds euros and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to hire and retain highly skilled and other key personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies we also rely on other highly skilled personnel competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

because we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors’ or customers’ technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation we use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including 

systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection employment trade and protectionist measures web services the provision of online payment services information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites health and sanitation standards the characteristics legality and quality of products and services product labeling and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel data protection and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content web services and artificial intelligence technologies and services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations laws and decisions interpreting or applying those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

we could be subject to additional tax liabilities and collection obligations 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenuebased taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services these include new obligations to collect sales consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations for example the european union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies in some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply by the effective date 

our tax expense and liabilities may also be affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example the legislation known as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “us tax act” requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the us tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the us tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws regulations our code of standards and responsibilities or implement practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous to the environment it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacture 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our services and stores that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods 

including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached compromised or otherwise unable to detect or prevent fraudulent activity we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures maintaining or processing data and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions we also may be unable to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results in addition to the extent any of this occurs it could harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows 1   free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2  and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs  our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

 



because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3   on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes 

we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests  we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million  and 507 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2018  

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2018  we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 190 million 

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions in addition a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the us tax reform legislation commonly known as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “us tax act” finally foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the us tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

the us tax act significantly changed how the us taxes corporations the us tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the us tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the us tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” is as follows in millions 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were  260 billion  310 billion  and 413 billion  as of december 31 2016  2017  and 2018  amounts held in foreign currencies were 91 billion  111 billion  and 138 billion  as of december 31 2016  2017  and 2018  and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

cash provided by used in  operating activities was 172 billion  184 billion  and 307 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase  in operating cash flow in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation cash provided by used in  operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

cash provided by used in  investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements incentives received from property and equipment vendors cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in  investing activities was 95 billion  271 billion  and 124 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities cash capital expenditures were  67 billion   101 billion  and 113 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws during all three years in 2016  2017  and 2018  we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 116 million  140 billion  and 22 billion  

cash provided by used in  financing activities was 37 billion  99 billion  and 77 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other which were 43 billion  63 billion  and 85 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  property and equipment acquired under capital leases was 57 billion  96 billion  and 106 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  with the increase  reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws which investments we expect to continue over time cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt and other proceeds from longterm debt and other were 618 million  162 billion  and 768 million  in 2016  2017  and 2018  during 2017 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of 160 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057 the proceeds from notes issued in august 2017 the “august 2017 notes” were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of whole foods market to repay notes due in 2017 and for general corporate purposes 

in april 2018 we established a commercial paper program the “commercial paper program” under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of 70 billion  at any time with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days  from the date of issue there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2018  

we had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” and 594 million  of borrowings outstanding under our 620 million  secured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” as of december 31 2018  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 5 — debt” for additional information 

in 2016  2017  and 2018  we recorded net tax provisions of 14 billion  769 million  and 12 billion  certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to us taxation under the us tax act which also repeals us taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts as of december 31 2018  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 120 billion 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income the us tax act enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 cash taxes paid net of refunds were 412 million  957 million  and 12 billion  for 2016  2017  and 2018  as of december 31 2018  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 627 million  and we had approximately 14 billion  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit as we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis in connection with the european commission’s october 2017 decision against us on state aid luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the european commission’s decision of approximately €250 million that we deposited into escrow in march 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases amounts due to thirdparty sellers in certain jurisdictions debt and standby and trade letters of credit to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash which is classified within “accounts receivable net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2017  and 2018  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 13 billion  and 426 million  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 7 — commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets additionally purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 131 billion  as of december 31 2018  these purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain capital finance and operating lease arrangements repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into three segments north america international and aws our results reflect the operations of whole foods market from the date of acquisition in august 2017 these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 10 — segment information” 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales primarily represent thirdparty seller fees which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees aws sales amazon prime membership fees advertising services and certain digital content subscriptions net sales information is as follows in millions 



sales increased   31  in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 550 million  210 million  and 13 billion  for 2016  2017  and 2018  for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased   33  in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and the impact of the acquisition of whole foods market increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers increased instock inventory availability and increased selection 

international sales increased   23  and 21  in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers increased instock inventory availability and increased selection changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 489 million  138 million  and 13 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  

aws sales increased   43  and 47  in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased customer usage partially offset by pricing changes pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers 

  

operating income loss 

operating income loss by segment is as follows in millions 



operating income was 42 billion  41 billion  and 124 billion  for 2016  2017  and 2018  we believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

the increase  in north america operating income in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 27 million  4 million  and 17 million  for 2016  2017  and 2018  

the decrease  in international operating loss in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by 89 million  85 million  and 258 million  for 2016  2017  and 2018  

the increase  in aws operating income in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 5 million  53 million  and 49 million  for 2016  2017  and 2018  

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses is as follows in millions 

  

cost of sales 

cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music packaging supplies sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs and inbound and outbound shipping costs including where we are the transportation service provider 

the increase  in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales 

shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers shipping costs which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs were 162 billion  217 billion  and 277 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as “technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment centers customer service centers and physical stores and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment aws costs are primarily classified as “technology and content” fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase  in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to costs from expanding our fulfillment network which includes physical stores and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels 

we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements 

marketing 

we direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our sponsored search third party customer referrals social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs 

the increase  in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities as well as increased spending on online marketing channels 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support aws and other amazon businesses collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers 

we seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure these costs are allocated to segments based on usage the increase  in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings 

general and administrative 

the increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2017  and 2018  compared to the comparable prior years is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses 

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net was 167 million  214 million  and 296 million  during 2016  2017  and 2018  and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 100 million  202 million  and 440 million  during 2016  2017  and 2018  we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

interest expense was 484 million  848 million  and 14 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  the increase  is primarily due to increases in our longterm debt and capital and finance lease arrangements 

our longterm debt was 247 billion  and 235 billion  as of december 31 2017  and 2018  our other longterm liabilities were 210 billion  and 272 billion  as of december 31 2017  and 2018  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 5 — debt and note 6 — other longterm liabilities” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 90 million  346 million  and 183 million  during 2016  2017  and 2018  the primary components of other income expense net are related to foreign currency equity warrant valuation and equity securities gains 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate intercompany transactions the applicability of special tax regimes changes in how we do business acquisitions investments auditrelated developments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower 

the us tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the us tax act significantly revised the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 eliminating certain deductions imposing a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries introducing new tax regimes and changing how foreign earnings are subject to us tax the us tax act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 we reasonably estimated the effects of the us tax act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of december 31 2017 we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the us tax act of approximately 789 million this amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the us statutory corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 after taking into account the mandatory onetime tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the amount of this onetime tax was not material in 2018 we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the us tax act 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 14 billion  769 million  and 12 billion  in 2016  2017  and 2018  our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the onetime favorable effect of the us tax act partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and auditrelated developments we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit 

we regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate in performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction we review all available evidence including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors in q2 2017 we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of 600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in luxembourg 

our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in us pretax income and the onetime provisional tax benefit of the us tax act recognized in 2017 this was partially offset by the reduction to the 

us federal statutory tax rate in 2018 a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as of december 31 2018  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 627 million  and we had approximately 14 billion  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 9 — income taxes” for additional information 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax was 96 million  4 million  and 9 million  in 2016  2017  and 2018  the primary components of this activity during 2016  2017  and 2018  were our equitymethod investment gains losses during the years and impairments recorded in 2016 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to add restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in  operating activities” for 2016  2017  and 2018  in millions 



free cash flow less lease principal repayments 

free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of capital lease obligations” and “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in  operating activities” for 2016  2017  and 2018  in millions 



free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases 

free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which is included in cash flow from financing activities and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in this measure property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash which is not the case as these assets have been leased the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in  operating activities” for 2016  2017  and 2018  in millions 



all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in aaarated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2018  in millions except percentages 

  

as of december 31 2018  we had 250 billion  of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt in millions 



based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our total debt was 250 billion  as of december 31 2018  

foreign exchange risk 

during 2018  net sales from our international segment accounted for 28  of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationallyfocused stores including within canada and mexico which are included in our north america segment are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused stores and aws are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year international segment net sales increased  by 13 billion  in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2018  of 138 billion  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 690 million 14 billion and 28 billion all cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are classified as “availableforsale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2018  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 145 million 305 million and 685 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2018  our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was 942 million our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent 518 million of our investments as of december 31 2018  and are recorded at fair value which is subject to market price volatility we perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment if this assessment indicates that an impairment exists we estimate the fair value of the investment and if the fair value is less than carrying value we write down the investment to fair value our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and electronic devices and web and infrastructure computing services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 



 our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 



 as international ecommerce and other online and web services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals in addition we provide certain technology services in china in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are thirdparty sellers on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions such as our acquisition of whole foods market inc create risks such as 



 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds euros and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection employment trade and protectionist measures web services the provision of online payment services information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites health and sanitation standards the characteristics and quality of products and services product labeling and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

we could be subject to additional sales tax or other tax liabilities 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices with or without notice that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly or at all failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest in addition if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were successfully to challenge our positions our tax liability could increase substantially in the us although supreme court decisions restrict states’ rights to require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes the supreme court has recently agreed to hear a case that could overturn prior precedent we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system 

we are also subject to us federal and state and foreign laws regulations and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our customers vendors merchants and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies the scope of such requirements continues to expand requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as intercompany 

transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates the applicability of special tax regimes losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies changes to our existing businesses and operations acquisitions including integrations and investments and how they are financed changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in addition a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the recently enacted us tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” finally foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

the 2017 tax act significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the 2017 tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance we have received notices of proposed adjustment “nopas” from the irs for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in us tax court on march 23 2017 the us tax court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the irs nopas the tax court rejected the approach from the irs nopas in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted with adjustments our suggested approach on september 29 2017 the irs filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter if the tax court decision were reversed on appeal or if the irs were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the nopas for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid on october 4 2017 the european commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in luxembourg did not comply with european union rules on state aid this decision orders luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period may 2006 through june 2014 we believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options including an appeal in december 2017 luxembourg appealed the european commission’s decision while the european commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million plus interest the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the european commission’s guidance although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws regulations our code of standards and responsibilities or implement practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous to the environment it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacture 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce services that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services the amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products and services sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income or other taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1a of part i “risk factors” 

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered through our consumerfacing websites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales we seek to increase unit sales across our businesses through increased product selection across numerous product categories we also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment publishing certain digital content subscriptions advertising and cobranded credit cards 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows 1   free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2  and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs  our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our websites and web services our electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and physical stores variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

 



because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3   on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes 

we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests  we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 497 million  and 504 million  as of december 31 2016 and 2017 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2017  we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 180 million 

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our whole foods market stores these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates the applicability of special tax regimes losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies changes to our existing businesses and operations acquisitions including integrations and investments and how they are financed changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in addition a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the recently enacted us tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” finally foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

the 2017 tax act significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the 2017 tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance we have received notices of proposed adjustment “nopas” from the irs for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer 

pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in us tax court on march 23 2017 the us tax court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the irs nopas the tax court rejected the approach from the irs nopas in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted with adjustments our suggested approach on september 29 2017 the irs filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter if the tax court decision were reversed on appeal or if the irs were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the nopas for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid on october 4 2017 the european commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in luxembourg did not comply with european union rules on state aid this decision orders luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period may 2006 through june 2014 we believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options including an appeal in december 2017 luxembourg appealed the european commission’s decision while the european commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million plus interest the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the european commission’s guidance although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals

cash provided by used in  operating activities was 120 billion  173 billion  and 184 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers advertising agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internaluse software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase  in operating cash flow in 2016  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation the increase  in operating cash flow in 2017  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation cash provided by used in  operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

cash provided by used in  investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs incentives received from property and equipment vendors cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in  investing activities was 65 billion  99 billion  and 278 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities cash capital expenditures were  46 billion   67 billion  and 101 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws during all three periods capital expenditures included 528 million  417 million  and 311 million  for internaluse software and website development in 2015  2016  and 2017  stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2015  2016  and 2017  we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 795 million  116 million  and 140 billion  

cash provided by used in  financing activities was 39 billion  37 billion  and 99 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other were 42 billion  44 billion  and 64 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  property and equipment acquired under capital leases were 47 billion  57 billion  and 96 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  with the increase  reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws which investments we expect to continue over time cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt proceeds from longterm debt and other were 353 million  621 million  and 162 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  during 2017 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of 160 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057 the proceeds from notes issued in august 2017 the “august 2017 notes” were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of whole foods market to repay the 1200 notes due november 2017 and for general corporate purposes see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” for additional discussion of the notes 

we had no borrowings outstanding under our 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” and 592 million  of borrowings outstanding under our 600 million  secured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” as of december 31 2017  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” for additional information 

in 2015  2016  and 2017  we recorded net tax provisions of 950 million  14 billion  and 769 million  the 2017 tax act includes a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and as a result all previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to us tax notwithstanding the us taxation of these amounts we intend to continue to invest most or all of these earnings as well as our capital in these subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us and do not expect to incur any significant additional taxes related to such amounts as of december 31 2017 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 96 billion 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income the 2017 tax act extended through 2026 and enhanced the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property cash taxes paid net of refunds were 273 million  412 million  and 957 million  for 2015  2016  and 2017  as of december 31 2017  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 226 million  and we had approximately 855 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit as we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis in connection with its october 2017 decision against us on state aid the european commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million plus interest the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the european commissions guidance once the recovery amount is computed by luxembourg we anticipate funding it including interest into escrow where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals we may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated recovery amount announced by the european commission 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases workers’ compensation obligations amounts due to thirdparty sellers in certain jurisdictions debt and standby and trade letters of credit to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash which is classified within “accounts receivable net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2016  and 2017  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 600 million  and 13 billion  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data 

—note 7—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets additionally purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 130 billion  as of december 31 2017  these purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain capital finance and operating lease arrangements repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into three segments north america international and aws our results reflect the operations of whole foods market from the date of acquisition in q1 2017 we combined stockbased compensation and “other operating expense net” with operating expenses in our presentation of segment results these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 11—segment information” 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees aws sales certain digital content subscriptions certain advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements amazon prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services net sales information is as follows in millions 

  



sales increased   27  and 31  in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 52 billion  550 million  and 210 million  for 2015  2016  and 2017  for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased   25  and 33  in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and in 2017 the impact of the acquisition of whole foods market increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers increased instock inventory availability and increased selection 

international sales increased   24  and 23  in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers increased instock inventory availability and increased selection changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 50 billion  489 million  and 138 million  in 2015  2016  and 2017  

aws sales increased   55  and 43  in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage partially offset by pricing changes pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers 

operating income loss 

operating income loss by segment is as follows in millions 



operating income was 22 billion  42 billion  and 41 billion  for 2015  2016  and 2017  we believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

the increase  in north america operating income in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 30 million  27 million  and 4 million  for 2015  2016  and 2017  

the increase  in international operating loss in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts partially offset by increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by 278 million  89 million  and 85 million  for 2015  2016  and 2017  

the increase  in aws operating income in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and sales and marketing expenses and related payroll which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 264 million  5 million  and 53 million  for 2015  2016  and 2017  

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses is as follows in millions 

  

cost of sales 

cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music packaging supplies sortation and delivery center and related equipment costs and inbound and outbound shipping costs including where we are the transportation service provider 

the increase  in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales 

shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers shipping costs which include sortation and delivery center and transportation costs were 115 billion  162 billion  and 217 billion  in 2015  2016  and 2017  we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as “technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment centers customer service centers and physical stores and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment aws costs are primarily classified as “technology and content” fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase  in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network which includes physical stores 

we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our sponsored search associates program social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs 

the increase  in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to payroll and related expenses as well as increased spending on online marketing channels 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our websites curation and display of products and services made available on our websites and infrastructure costs infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support aws as well as these and other efforts collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers 

we seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure these costs are allocated to segments based on usage the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure 

for 2015  2016  and 2017  we capitalized 642 million  including 114 million  of stockbased compensation 511 million  including 94 million  of stockbased compensation and 395 million  including 84 million  of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 635 million  634 million  and 545 million  for 2015  2016  and 2017  

general and administrative 

the increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2016  and 2017  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net was 171 million  167 million  and 214 million  during 2015  2016  and 2017  and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 50 million  100 million  and 202 million  during 2015  2016  and 2017  we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

interest expense was 459 million  484 million  and 848 million  in 2015  2016  and 2017  the increase  is primarily due to increases in our capital and finance lease arrangements and longterm debt 

our longterm debt was 77 billion  and 247 billion  as of december 31 2016  and 2017  our other longterm liabilities were 126 billion  and 210 billion  as of december 31 2016  and 2017  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt and note 6—other longterm liabilities” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 256 million  90 million  and 346 million  during 2015  2016  and 2017  the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments auditrelated developments changes in our stock price foreign currency gains losses tax law developments including changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower 

the 2017 tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act significantly revises the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 eliminating certain deductions imposing a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017 introducing new tax regimes and changing how foreign earnings are subject to us tax the 2017 tax act also enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property we have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017 tax act on our tax accruals however we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 tax act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of december 31 2017 we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 tax act of approximately 789 million this amount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the us statutory corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 after taking into account the mandatory onetime tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the amount of this onetime tax is not material as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 950 million  14 billion  and 769 million  in 2015  2016  and 2017  our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in us pretax income partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax benefit an increase in tax amortization deductions and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit 

our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the provisional favorable effect of the 2017 tax act partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and auditrelated developments 

we regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate in performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction we review all available evidence including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors in q2 2017 we 

recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of 600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in luxembourg 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income the 2017 tax act enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property as of december 31 2017  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 226 million  and we had approximately 855 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 10—income taxes” for additional information 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax was 22 million  96 million  and 4 million  in 2015  2016  and 2017  the primary components of this activity during 2015 2016 and 2017 were our equitymethod investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of 119 million and 829 million in 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment including internaluse software and website development net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in  operating activities” for 2015  2016  and 2017  in millions 



free cash flow less lease principal repayments 

free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of capital lease obligations” and “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in  operating activities” for 2015  2016  and 2017  in millions 



free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases 

free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which is included in cash flow from financing activities and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in this measure property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash which is not the case as these assets have been leased the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in  operating activities” for 2015  2016  and 2017  in millions 



all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

effect of foreign exchange rates 

information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our net sales operating expenses and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods the effect on our net sales operating expenses and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions 



  



guidance 

we provided guidance on february 1 2018 in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as set forth below these forwardlooking statements reflect amazoncom’s expectations as of february 1 2018 and are subject to substantial uncertainty our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services as well as those outlined in item 1a of part i “risk factors”

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2017  in millions except percentages 

  

as of december 31 2017  we had 249 billion  of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt in millions 



based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our total debt was 264 billion  as of december 31 2017  

foreign exchange risk 

during 2017  net sales from our international segment accounted for 30  of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationallyfocused websites and from wwwamazonca   and wwwamazoncommx which are included in our north america segment are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros japanese yen and british pounds the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites and aws are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to rates in effect the prior year international segment net sales increased  by 137 million  in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2017  of 111 billion  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 555 million 11 billion and 22 billion all investments are classified as “availableforsale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2017  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 280 million 600 million and 13 billion recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2017  our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was 737 million we record our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value which is subject to market price volatility and represents 415 million of our investments as of december 31 2017  we evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and electronic devices and web and infrastructure computing services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 



 our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 



 as international ecommerce and other online and web services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals in addition we provide certain technology services in china in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a thirdparty seller on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 



 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds euros and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 



 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection trade and protectionist measures web services the provision of online payment services information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites the characteristics and quality of products and services and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

we could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilities 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices with or without notice that impose additional obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest in addition if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were successfully to challenge our positions our tax liability could increase substantially in the us supreme court decisions restrict states’ rights to require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes although some states are seeking to have the supreme court revisit these decisions we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system 

we are also subject to us federal and state and foreign laws regulations and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our customers vendors merchants and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies the scope of such requirements continues to expand requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard 

except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the 

us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006 and we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws regulations our code of standards and responsibilities or implement practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous to the environment it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacture 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce services that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer co 

branded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services the amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products and services sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income or other taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1a of part i “risk factors” 

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our consumerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales we also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment publishing certain digital content subscriptions advertising and cobranded credit cards 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows 1   free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2  and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs  our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our websites and web services our electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

 



because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3   on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes 

we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests  we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 490 million  and 497 million  as of december 31 2015 and 2016 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2016  we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 130 million 

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard 

except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006 and we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—recent accounting pronouncements” 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows in millions 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were  174 billion  198 billion  and 260 billion  as of december 31 2014  2015  and 2016  amounts held in foreign currencies were 54 billion 73 billion and 91 billion  as of december 31 2014  2015  and 2016  and were primarily euros japanese yen and british pounds 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 68 billion  119 billion  and 164 billion  in 2014  2015  and 2016  our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers advertising agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internaluse software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase  in operating cash flow in 2015  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation and changes in working capital the increase  in operating cash flow in 2016  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation cash provided by used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in investing activities was 51 billion  65 billion  and 99 billion  in 2014  2015  and 2016  with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and changes in cash paid for acquisitions cash capital expenditures were 49 billion   46 billion  and 67 billion  in 2014  2015  and 2016  which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws during all three periods capital expenditures included 537 million 528 million and 417 million for internaluse software and website development in 2014  2015  and 2016  stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2014  2015  and 2016  we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 979 million  795 million  and 116 million  

cash provided by used in financing activities was 44 billion  38 billion  and 29 billion  in 2014  2015  and 2016  cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other were 19 billion  42 billion  and 44 billion  in 2014  2015  and 2016  the increase in 2015 primarily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a 750 million repayment on our unsecured senior notes property and equipment acquired under capital leases were 40 billion  47 billion  and 57 billion  in 2014  2015  and 2016  with the increase  reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws which investments we expect to continue over time cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions proceeds from longterm debt and other were 64 billion  353 million  and 621 million  in 2014  

2015  and 2016  during 2014 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of 60 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” for additional discussion of the notes tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 6 million  119 million  and 829 million  in 2014  2015  and 2016  

we had no borrowings outstanding under our 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” and 495 million  of borrowings outstanding under our 500 million secured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” as of december 31 2016  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” for additional information 

in 2014  2015  and 2016  we recorded net tax provisions of 167 million  950 million  and 14 billion  except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected as of december 31 2016  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 86 billion  which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the us of 28 billion  we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income in december 2015 us legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 cash taxes paid net of refunds were 177 million  273 million  and 412 million  for 2014  2015  and 2016  as of december 31 2016  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 76 million  and we had approximately 608 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit as we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit guarantees debt and real estate leases to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash which is classified within “accounts receivable net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2015  and 2016  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 285 million  and 600 million  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 7—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 85 billion  as of december 31 2016  purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months which includes the maturation of 10 billion  of our unsecured senior notes however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain capital finance and operating lease arrangements repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into three segments north america international and aws in the first quarter of 2016 we began allocating stockbased compensation and “other operating expense net” to our segment results and we conformed prior period segment results to the current presentation these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 11—segment information” 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees aws sales certain digital content subscriptions certain advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements amazon prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services net sales information is as follows in millions 

  



sales increased   20  20  and 27  in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 636 million  52 billion  and 550 million  for 2014  2015  and 2016  for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased   23  25  and 25  in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings 

international sales increased   12  6  and 24  in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 580 million  50 billion  and 489 million  in 2014  2015  and 2016  increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from 

our shipping offers sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings 

aws sales increased 49  70  and 55  in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage partially offset by pricing changes pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers 

operating income loss 

operating income loss by segment is as follows in millions 



operating income was 178 million  22 billion  and 42 billion  for 2014  2015  and 2016  we believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

the increase in north america operating income in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 0 million  30 million  and 27 million  for 2014  2015  and 2016  

the increase in international operating loss in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts partially offset by increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income loss by 27 million  278 million  and 89 million  for 2014  2015  and 2016  

the increase in aws operating income in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 41 million  264 million  and 5 million  for 2014  2015  and 2016  

supplemental information 

supplemental information about outbound shipping results for our north america and international segments is as follows in millions 

  

 

 we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses is as follows in millions 

  

in 2014 we recorded charges estimated at 170 million primarily related to fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs the majority of which was included in our north america segment 

cost of sales 

cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including prime video and prime music packaging supplies sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs and inbound and outbound shipping costs including where we are the transportation service provider shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers 

the increase  in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales 

costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as “technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment and customer service centers and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment aws costs are primarily classified as “technology and content” fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our 

customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase  in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense 

the increase  in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels and television advertising as well as payroll and related expenses 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application production maintenance operation and development of new and existing products and services as well as aws and other technology infrastructure costs content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying and merchandising selection 

we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our aws segment 

technology infrastructure costs consist of servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation rent utilities and payroll expenses these costs are allocated to segments based on usage in 2014  2015  and 2016  we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for aws service offerings globally compared to the comparable prior year periods additionally the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time corresponding with increased usage we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage 

the increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of existing product categories and service offerings including aws and initiatives to introduce new product and service offerings 

for 2014  2015  and 2016  we capitalized 641 million  including 104 million  of stockbased compensation 642 million  including 114 million  of stockbased compensation and 511 million  including 94 million  of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 559 million  635 million  and 634 million  for 2014  2015  and 2016  

general and administrative 

the increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2015  and 2016  compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses 

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net was 133 million  171 million  and 167 million  during 2014  2015  and 2016  and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 39 million  50 million  and 100 million  during 2014  2015  and 2016  we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

interest expense was 210 million  459 million  and 484 million  in 2014  2015  and 2016  the increase  is primarily due to increases in our longterm debt and capital and finance lease arrangements 

our longterm debt was 82 billion  and 77 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2016  our other longterm liabilities were 92 billion  and 126 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2016  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt and note 6—other longterm liabilities” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 118 million  256 million  and 90 million  during 2014  2015  and 2016  the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation gains losses 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments auditrelated developments foreign currency gains losses tax law developments including changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 167 million  950 million  and 14 billion  in 2014  2015  and 2016  our provision for income taxes in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in us pretax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries reduce our pretax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit we also generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg 

our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in us pretax income partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax benefit an increase in tax amortization deductions and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit we generated income and losses in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our european operations 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income in december 2015 us legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the us federal research and development credit as of december 31 2016  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 76 million  and we had approximately 608 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 10—income taxes” for additional information 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax was 37 million  22 million  and 96 million  in 2014  2015  and 2016  the primary component of this activity during 2014 was our share of a gain recorded by livingsocial related to the sale of its korean operations this gain was partially offset by operating losses incurred by livingsocial during the period the primary components of this activity during 2015 and 2016 were our equitymethod investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016 

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment including internaluse software and website development net” which is included in cash flow from investing activities the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2014  2015  and 2016  in millions 



free cash flow less lease principal repayments 

free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of capital lease obligations” and “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2014  2015  and 2016  in millions 



free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases 

free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in this measure property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash which is not the case as these assets have been leased the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2014  2015  and 2016  in millions 



all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

effect of foreign exchange rates 

information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our net sales operating expenses and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods the effect on our net sales operating expenses and operating income is as follows in millions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2016  in millions except percentages 

  

as of december 31 2016  we had 88 billion  of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt in millions 



based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our total debt was 93 billion  as of december 31 2016  

foreign exchange risk 

during 2016  net sales from our international segment accounted for 32  of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationallyfocused websites and from wwwamazonca   and wwwamazoncommx which are included in our north america segment are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros japanese yen and british pounds the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites and aws are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2016  international segment net sales decreased  by 489 million  in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2016  of 91 billion  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 455 million 915 million and 18 billion all investments are classified as “availableforsale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2016  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 225 million 476 million and 11 billion recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2016  our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was 467 million we record our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value which is subject to market price volatility and represents 242 million of our investments as of december 31 2016  we evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and electronic devices and web and infrastructure computing services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 6 

 our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 7 

 as international ecommerce and other online and web services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals in addition we provide certain technology services in china in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a thirdparty seller on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 9 

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds chinese yuan euros and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 11 

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites the characteristics and quality of products and services and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

we could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilities 

us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales in the us however an increasing number of states and certain foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest in addition if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we already collect sales tax or other indirect taxes were successfully to challenge our positions our tax liability could increase substantially 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard 

except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs 

as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006 and we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws regulations our code of standards and responsibilities or implement practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous to the environment it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating 

results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows 1  per share  free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2  and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 490 million  and 483 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs  our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our websites and web services our electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3   on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 4  was 8  for 2015  and 9  for 2014  and 2013  we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers accounts payable days 5  were 77  73 and 74 for 2015  2014  and 2013  we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2015  we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 115 million 

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable during the second quarter of 2015 we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from october 1 to april 1 in testing for goodwill impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a twostep impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the twostep impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a 10 decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of april 1 2015 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weightedaverage cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are shortterm in nature or a longerterm trend we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged 20 decrease from our december 31 2015  closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes model the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee level economic conditions time remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stockbased compensation changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stockbased compensation expense in the future as a measure of sensitivity a 1 change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately 46 million impact on our 2015  operating income our estimated forfeiture rates as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were 28 and 27 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense for example over 50 of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard 

except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006 and we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—recent accounting pronouncements” 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows in millions 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 198 billion  174 billion  and 124 billion as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  amounts held in foreign currencies were 73 billion  54 billion and 56 billion as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  and were primarily euros japanese yen and british pounds 

cash provided by operating activities was 119 billion  68 billion  and 55 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers advertising agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internaluse software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase  in operating cash flow in 2015  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income loss excluding noncash charges to net income loss such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation and changes in working capital the increase  in operating cash flow in 2014  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in noncash charges to net income loss including depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by changes in working capital 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in investing activities was 65 billion  51 billion  and 43 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and changes in cash paid for acquisitions cash capital expenditures were 46 billion   49 billion  and  34 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  this primarily reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations during all three periods capital expenditures included 528 million 537 million and 493 million for internaluse software and website development in 2015  2014  and 2013  stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2015  2014  and 2013  we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 795 million  979 million  and 312 million  

cash provided by used in financing activities was 38 billion  44 billion  and 539 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other were 42 billion  19 billion  and 10 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  the increase in 2015 primarily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a 750 million repayment on our unsecured senior notes property and equipment acquired under capital leases were 47 billion  40 billion  and 19 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  with the increases  reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws we expect this trend toward additional investment to continue over time cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions proceeds from longterm debt and other were 353 million  64 billion  and 394 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  during 2014 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of 60 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” for additional discussion of the notes tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 119 million  6 million  and 78 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  

we had no borrowings outstanding under our 20 billion credit agreement as of december 31 2015  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” for additional information 

in 2015  2014  and 2013  we recorded net tax provisions of 950 million  167 million  and 161 million  except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected as of december 31 2015  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were 58 billion which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the us of 15 billion  we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income in december 2015 us legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 cash taxes paid net of refunds were 273 million  177 million  and 169 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  as of december 31 2015  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 11 billion  and we had approximately 622 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit which was made permanent in 2015 as we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit guarantees debt and real estate leases to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash which is classified within “accounts receivable net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2015  and 2014  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 285 million  and 450 million  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 7—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 62 billion as of december 31 2015  purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 8  for 2015  and 9  for 2014  and 2013  we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain capital finance and operating lease arrangements repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

beginning in the first quarter of 2015 we changed our reportable segments to north america international and aws these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations see item 1 of part 1“financial statements—note 11—segment information” 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees aws sales digital content subscriptions advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements amazon prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services net sales information is as follows in millions 

  



sales increased   20  20  and 22  in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 52 billion  636 million  and 13 billion  for 2015  2014  and 2013  for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased   25  23  and 26  in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings 

international sales increased   6  12  and 14  in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 50 billion  580 million  and 13 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers sales in faster growing categories such 

as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings 

aws sales increased 70  49  and 69  in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage partially offset by pricing changes pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers 

segment operating income loss 

segment operating income loss is as follows in millions 



the increase in north america segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure there was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 30 million 0 and 7 million for 2015  2014  and 2013  

the decrease in international segment operating loss in absolute dollars in 2015  compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates was 278 million 27 million and 70 million for 2015  2014  and 2013  the decrease in international segment operating income loss in absolute dollars in 2014 compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts partially offset by increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers 

the increase in aws segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2015  compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth the decrease in aws segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2014 compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure which was primarily driven by increased usage there was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 264 million 41 million and 38 million for 2015  2014  and 2013  

supplemental information 

supplemental information about outbound shipping results for our north america and international segments is as follows in millions 

  

 

 we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing placement of fulfillment centers negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

we have aggregated our north america and international segments’ products and services into groups of similar products and services and provided the supplemental disclosure of net sales in millions below we evaluate whether additional disclosure is appropriate when a product or service category begins to approach a significant level of net sales for the periods presented no individual product or service represented more than 10 of net sales 



 

 

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

  

operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

in 2014 we recorded charges estimated at 170 million primarily related to fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs the majority of which was included in the north america segment 

cost of sales 

cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including prime video and prime music packaging supplies sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs and inbound and outbound shipping costs including where we are the transportation service provider shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers 

the increase  in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales the increase in 2014 was also impacted by the expansion of digital offerings and fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs 

costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as “technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment and customer service centers and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment aws costs are primarily classified as “technology and content” fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction 

and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase  in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns direct sales and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense 

the increase  in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels as well as payroll and related expenses 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application production maintenance operation and platform development for new and existing products and services as well as aws and other technology infrastructure expenses content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying and merchandising selection digital media content costs related to revenue recorded gross including prime video are included in cost of sales 

we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our aws segment and an increase in payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services 

technology infrastructure costs consist of servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation rent utilities and payroll expenses these costs are allocated to segments based on usage in 2015  2014  and 2013  we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for aws service offerings globally compared to the comparable prior year periods additionally the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time corresponding with increased usage we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage 

the increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings including aws and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of products and services 

for 2015  2014  and 2013  we capitalized 642 million  including 114 million  of stockbased compensation 641 million  including 104 million  of stockbased compensation and 581 million  including 87 million  of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 635 million  559 million  and 451 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  

general and administrative 

the increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2015  compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses the increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014  compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation was 21 billion  15 billion  and 11 billion  during 2015  2014  and 2013  the increase  in 2015  2014  and 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in the number of stockbased compensation awards granted to existing and new employees 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 171 million  133 million  and 114 million  during 2015  2014  and 2013  and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets 

income from operations 

for the reasons discussed above income from operations increased  to 22 billion  in 2015  from 178 million  in 2014  and 745 million  in 2013  

we believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 50 million  39 million  and 38 million  during 2015  2014  and 2013  we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

interest expense was 459 million  210 million  and 141 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  the increase  is primarily due to increases in our longterm debt and capital and finance lease arrangements 

our longterm debt was 82 billion  and 83 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  our other longterm liabilities were 99 billion  and 74 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt and note 6—other longterm liabilities” for additional information

other income expense net was 256 million  118 million  and 136 million  during 2015  2014  and 2013  the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreigncurrency gains losses 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments auditrelated developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 950 million  167 million  and 161 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  our provision for income taxes in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in us pretax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries reduce our pretax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit we generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg 

our provision for income taxes in 2014 was higher than in 2013 primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and auditrelated developments partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit were primarily generated by our foreign subsidiaries income earned in lower tax jurisdictions was primarily related to our european operations 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income in december 2015 us legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the us federal research and development credit as of december 31 2015  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 11 billion  and we had 

approximately 622 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit which was made permanent in 2015 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 10—income taxes” for additional information 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax was 22 million  37 million  and 71 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  and is primarily related to our investment in livingsocial the primary component of this activity during 2014  was our share of a gain recorded by livingsocial related to the sale of its korean operations this gain was partially offset by operating losses incurred by livingsocial during the period 

effect of foreign exchange rates 

the effect on our income from operations from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions 



  

 nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of free cash flows operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment including internaluse software and website development net” which is included in cash flow from investing activities the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions 



free cash flow less lease principal repayments 

free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of capital lease obligations” and “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions 



free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases 

free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in this measure property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash which is not the case as these assets have been leased the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions 



all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation 

operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is provided to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment 

results and therefore excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “marketing” “technology and content” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher 

effect of foreign exchange rates 

information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2015  in millions except percentages 

  

as of december 31 2015  we had 85 billion  of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt in millions 



the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our total debt was 88 billion  as of december 31 2015  

foreign exchange risk 

during 2015  net sales from our international segment accounted for 33  of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationallyfocused websites and from wwwamazonca   and wwwamazoncommx which are included in our north america segment are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros japanese yen and british pounds the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites and aws are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2015  international segment revenues decreased  by 50 billion  in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2015  of 73 billion  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 365 million 730 million and 15 billion all investments are classified as “availableforsale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2015  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 190 million 405 million and 905 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2015  our recorded basis in equity investments was 280 million these investments primarily relate to equitymethod and costmethod investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and electronic devices and web and infrastructure computing services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 6 

 our international operations expose us to a number of risks 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 7 

 as international ecommerce and other online and web services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” and india regulate amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn  is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals in addition we provide certain technology services in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin  we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that the government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment and data centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment and data centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways as we continue to add fulfillment warehouse and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 

in addition a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment centers will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 9 

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds chinese yuan euros and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 11 

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites the characteristics and quality of products and services and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

we do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions 

us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales however an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on outofstate retailers to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard 

except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional 

amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006 and we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years amazon could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws regulations our code of standards and responsibilities or implement practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous to the environment it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce the amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which the company enters into maintains and develops commercial agreements acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1a of part i “risk factors” 

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our consumerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as service sales we also offer other services such as aws fulfillment publishing digital content subscriptions advertising and cobranded credit cards 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1  per share  free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2  and cash capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 483 million  and 476 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs  our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our websites and web services our electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3   on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 4  was 9  for 2014  2013  and 2012  we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers accounts payable days 5  were 73  74 and 76 for 2014  2013  and 2012  we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as web services expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2014  we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 95 million 

in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october 1 we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a 10 decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december 31 2014  would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are shortterm in nature or a longerterm trend we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged 20 decrease from our december 31 2014  closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee classification economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stockbased compensation changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stockbased compensation expense in the future as a measure of sensitivity a 1 change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately 30 million impact on our 2014  operating income our estimated forfeiture rate as of december 31 2014  and 2013  was 27 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense for example over 50 of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other 

conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard 

except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us in addition in october 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006 and we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years amazon could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 19 billion  for 2014  compared to 20 billion  and 395 million  for 2013  and 2012  see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the decrease  in free cash flow for 2014 compared to the comparable prior year period was due to increased cash capital expenditures partially offset by higher operating cash flows the increase  in free cash flow for 2013 compared to the comparable prior year period was due to higher operating cash flows and decreased cash capital expenditures operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures including our decision to finance property and equipment under capital leases and other financing arrangements and our net income loss working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 174 billion  124 billion  and 114 billion as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  cash and cash equivalents also reflects net proceeds from the issuance of 60 billion of longterm debt as of december 31 2014 amounts held in foreign currencies were 54 billion  56 billion and 51 billion as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  and were primarily british pounds chinese yuan euros and japanese yen 

cash provided by operating activities was 68 billion  55 billion  and 42 billion  in 2014  2013  and 2012  our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers advertising agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internaluse software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase  in operating cash flow in 2014  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in noncash charges to net income including depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by changes in working capital the increase  in operating cash flow in 2013  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by changes in working capital 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in investing activities was 51 billion  43 billion  and 36 billion  in 2014  2013  and 2012  with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments and changes in cash paid for acquisitions cash capital expenditures were 49 billion  34 billion  and 38 billion  during 2014  2013  and 2012  in december 2012 we acquired 11 buildings comprising 18 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in seattle washington for 14 billion excluding this acquisition increases in capital expenditures primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including aws during all three periods we expect this trend to continue over time capital expenditures included 537 million 493 million and 381 million for internaluse software and website development during 2014  2013  and 2012  stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2014  2013  and 2012  we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 979 million  312 million  and 745 million  

additionally in january 2015 we signed an agreement to acquire a technology company for approximately 350 million in cash which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand we expect the acquisition to close in the first half of 2015 subject to closing conditions 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 44 billion  539 million  and 23 billion  in 2014  2013  and 2012  cash outflows from financing activities result from common stock repurchases principal payments on obligations related to capital and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt principal payments on obligations related to capital leases finance leases and repayments of longterm debt were 19 billion  10 billion  and 588 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  property and equipment acquired under capital leases were 40 billion  19 billion  and 802 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  with the increases  reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws we expect this trend to continue over time we repurchased 53 million shares of common stock for 960 million in 2012 under the 20 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january 2010 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt and tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions proceeds from longterm debt and other were 64 billion  394 million  and 34 billion  in 2014  2013  and 2012  during 2014 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of 60 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044 during 2012 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of 30 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in three tranches maturing in 2015 through 2022 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt” for additional discussion of the notes tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 6 million  78 million  and 429 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  

in september 2014 we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of lenders that provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to 20 billion we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2014 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt” for additional information 

in 2014  2013  and 2012  we recorded net tax provisions of 167 million  161 million  and 428 million  except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected as of december 31 2014  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were 46 billion which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the us of 25 billion  we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income in december 2014 us legislation was enacted providing a one year extension of accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2014 cash taxes paid net of refunds were 177 million  169 million  and 112 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  as of december 31 2014  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 19 billion  and we had approximately 443 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit which expired in 2014 as we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit guarantees debt and real estate leases to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “cash and cash equivalents” to “accounts receivable net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014  and 2013  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 450 million  and 301 million  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 8—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 45 billion as of december 31 2014  purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 9  for 2014  2013  and 2012  we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and borrowing available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain capital finance and operating lease arrangements repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive officer reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales 

net sales include product and service sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross service sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees digital content subscriptions and nonretail activities such as aws advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements amazon prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services net sales information is as follows in millions 

  



sales increased   20  22  and 27  in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 636 million  13 billion  and 854 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates see “effect of foreign exchange rates” below 

north america sales increased   25  28  and 30  in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers and aws which was partially offset by aws pricing changes increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings 

international sales increased   12  14  and 23  in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 580 million  13 billion  and 853 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  

supplemental information 

supplemental information about outbound shipping results is as follows in millions 

  



 

 we expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing placement of fulfillment centers negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

we have aggregated our products and services into groups of similar products and services and provided the supplemental disclosure of net sales in millions below we evaluate whether additional disclosure is appropriate when a product or service category begins to approach a significant level of net sales for the periods presented no individual product or service represented more than 10 of net sales

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

  



operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

we recorded charges related to fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs substantially all of which 170 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2014 

cost of sales 

cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital media content where we record revenue gross including prime instant video packaging supplies and inbound and outbound shipping costs including sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers 

the increase  in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product digital media content and shipping costs resulting from increased sales as well as from expansion of digital offerings the increase in 2014 was also impacted by fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs 

consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows in millions 

  



gross margin increased  in 2014  compared to the comparable prior year periods primarily due to service sales increasing as a percentage of total sales service sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees digital content subscriptions and nonretail activities such as aws advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements 

we believe that income loss from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase  in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we evaluate our facility requirements as necessary 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense 

the increase  in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels such as our sponsored search programs payroll and related expenses and television advertising 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure including aws expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services as well as in technology infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure digital media content where we record revenue gross including prime instant video is included in cost of sales 

technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application production maintenance operation and platform development for new and existing products and services as well as aws and other technology infrastructure expenses 

content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying and merchandising selection 

the increase  in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure including aws and increases in payroll and related expenses including those associated with our initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in these areas by increasing payroll and related expenses and adding technology infrastructure 

for 2014  2013  and 2012  we capitalized 641 million  including 104 million  of stockbased compensation 581 million  including 87 million  of stockbased compensation and 454 million  including 74 million  of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized 

amounts was 559 million  451 million  and 327 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  a majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us most of which are allocated to our north america segment infrastructure other technology and operating costs incurred to support aws are included in technology and content 

general and administrative 

the increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation was 15 billion  11 billion  and 833 million  during 2014  2013  and 2012  the increase  in 2014  2013  and 2012  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in the number of stockbased compensation awards granted to existing and new employees 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 133 million  114 million  and 159 million  during 2014  2013  and 2012  and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets 

income from operations 

for the reasons discussed above income from operations decreased   76  in 2014  increased  10 in 2013  and decreased 22 in 2012  

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 39 million  38 million  and 40 million  during 2014  2013  and 2012  we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

the primary components of our interest expense are related to our longterm debt and capital and finance lease arrangements interest expense was 210 million  141 million  and 92 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  

our longterm debt was 83 billion  and 32 billion  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our other longterm liabilities were 74 billion  and 42 billion  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and note 7—other longterm liabilities” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 118 million  136 million  and 80 million  during 2014  2013  and 2012  the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreigncurrency gains losses 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments auditrelated developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 167 million  161 million  and 428 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  our provision for income taxes in 2014 was higher than in 2013 primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and auditrelated developments partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit reduce our pretax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg 

in 2013 our provision for income taxes was lower than in 2012 primarily due to a decline in the proportion of our losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the 

retroactive extension in 2013 of the us federal research and development credit to 2012 in 2013 we recognized tax benefits for a greater proportion of losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit primarily due to losses of certain foreign subsidiaries as compared to 2012 the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions was primarily related to our european operations 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income in december 2014 us legislation was enacted providing a one year extension of accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property and the us federal research and development credit through december 31 2014 as of december 31 2014  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 19 billion  and we had approximately 443 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the us federal research and development credit which expired in 2014

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of “free cash flow” operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

we provide multiple measures of free cash flow and ratios based on them because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment including internaluse software and website development” which are included in cash flow from investing activities the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions 

  



free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of capital lease obligations” and “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions 



free cash flow less finance principal lease repayments and capital acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “principal repayments of finance lease obligations” which are included in cash flow from financing activities and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in this measure property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been acquired with cash the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance principal lease repayments and capital acquired under capital leases to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions 



all of these free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flow do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is provided to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “marketing” “technology and content” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher 

information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period 

guidance 

we provided guidance on january 29 2015  in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as set forth below these forwardlooking statements reflect amazoncom’s expectations as of january 29 2015  and are subject to substantial uncertainty our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce as well as those outlined in item 1a of part i “risk factors”

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of our debt on which we pay interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2014  in millions except percentages 

  

as of december 31 2014  we had 99 billion  of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt in millions 



the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our total debt was 100 billion  as of december 31 2014  

foreign exchange risk 

during 2014  net sales from our international segment accounted for 38  of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally focused websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca and wwwamazoncommx  which are included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include british pounds chinese yuan euros and japanese yen the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2014  international segment revenues decreased   580 million  in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2014  of 54 billion  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of 270 million 535 million and 11 billion all investments are classified as “availableforsale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2014  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 145 million 310 million and 700 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—effect of foreign exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2014  our recorded basis in equity investments was 209 million these investments primarily relate to equitymethod and costmethod investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and electronic devices and web and infrastructure computing services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 6 

 we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 7 

 as international ecommerce and other online and web services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” regulates amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in the prc through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet it infrastructure retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals although we believe these structures comply with existing prc laws they involve unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if our chinese business interests were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition the chinese businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer 

service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 9 

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros japanese yen british pounds and chinese yuan if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 11 

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

we do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions 

us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales however an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on outofstate retailers to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses by acquisitions including integrations and investments by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the united states many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard in addition we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce the amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims fulfillment and data center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which the company enters into maintains and develops commercial agreements acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1a of part i “risk factors” 

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our consumerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as services sales we also offer other services such as aws fulfillment publishing digital content subscriptions advertising and cobranded credit cards 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1  per share  free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2  and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 476 million  and 470 million  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs  our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our websites and web services our electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

 

 17 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3   on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 4  was 9  9 and 10 for 2013  2012  and 2011  we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 5  were 74 76 and 74 for 2013  2012  and 2011  we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as web services expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31 2013  we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 79 million 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october 1 we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a 10 decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december 31 2013  would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a shortterm swing or a longerterm trend we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged 20 decrease from our december 31 2013  closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stockbased compensation changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stockbased compensation expense in the future as a measure of sensitivity a 1 change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately 32 million impact on our 2013  operating income our estimated forfeiture rate as of december 31 2013  and 2012  was 27 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense for example over 50 of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard in addition we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows in millions 

  



our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 20 billion  for 2013  compared to 395 million  and 21 billion  for 2012  and 2011  see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the increase  in free cash flow for 2013  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to higher operating cash flows and decreased capital expenditures the decrease in free cash flow for 2012  compared to the comparable prior year period was due to increased capital expenditures including a 14 billion purchase of property in december 2012 partially offset by higher operating cash flows operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures and our net income loss working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 124 billion  114 billion  and 96 billion as of december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  amounts held in foreign currencies were 56 billion  51 billion and 41 billion as of december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  and were primarily euros british pounds japanese yen and chinese yuan 

cash provided by operating activities was 55 billion  42 billion  and 39 billion  in 2013  2012  and 2011  our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers advertising agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internaluse software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase  in operating cash flow in 2013  compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by changes in working capital the increase  in operating cash flow in 2012 compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation additions to unearned revenue and changes in working capital partially offset by increased tax benefits on excess stockbased compensation deductions 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash provided by used in investing activities was 43 billion  36 billion  and 19 billion  in 2013  2012  and 2011  with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments and changes in cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures were 34 billion  38 billion  and 18 billion  during 2013  2012  and 2011  in december 2012  we acquired 11 buildings comprising 18 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in seattle washington for 14 billion excluding this acquisition increases in capital expenditures primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including aws during all three periods we expect this trend to continue over time capital expenditures included 493 million 381 million and 256 million for internaluse software and website development during 2013  2012  and 2011  stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2013  2012  and 2011  we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 312 million  745 million  and 705 million  

cash provided by used in financing activities was 539 million  23 billion  and 482 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  cash outflows from financing activities result from common stock repurchases payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of longterm debt payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of longterm debt were 10 

billion  588 million  and 444 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  property and equipment acquired under capital leases were 19 billion  802 million  and 753 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  with the increases  primarily reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including aws we repurchased 53 million shares of common stock for 960 million in 2012 and 15 million shares of common stock for 277 million in 2011 under the 20 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january 2010 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt and tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions proceeds from longterm debt and other were 394 million  34 billion  and 177 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  during 2012 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of 30 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in three tranches 750 million of 065 notes due in 2015 10 billion of 120 notes due in 2017 and 13 billion of 250 notes due in 2022 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt” for additional discussion of the notes tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 78 million  429 million  and 62 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  

in 2013  2012  and 2011  we recorded net tax provisions of 161 million  428 million  and 291 million  except as required under us tax law we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings as of december 31 2013  cash held by foreign subsidiaries was 46 billion which include undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the us of 25 billion  we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property were a result of us legislation that expired in december 2013 as such cash taxes paid net of refunds were 169 million  112 million  and 33 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  as of december 31 2013  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 275 million  and we had approximately 295 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities the us federal research and development credit expired in december 2013 as we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby letters of credit guarantees debt and real estate lease agreements as of december 31 2013  and 2012  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 301 million  and 99 million  to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some states may restrict our use of those funds this restriction would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “cash and cash equivalents” to “accounts receivable net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 8—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 44 billion as of december 31 2013  purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 9  9 and 10 for 2013  2012  and 2011  we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive officer reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales 

net sales include product and services sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital content where we are the seller of record services sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees digital content subscriptions and nonretail activities such as aws advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements amazon prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and services sales net sales information is as follows in millions 

  



sales grew   22  27  and 41  in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods changes in currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 13 billion  854 million  and 11 billion  for 2013  2012  and 2011  for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

north america sales grew   28  30  and 43  in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings 

international sales grew   14  23  and 38  in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 13 billion  853 million  and 11 billion  in 2013  2012  and 2011  we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—segment information” for net sales attributed to foreign countries 

supplemental information 

supplemental information about outbound shipping results is as follows in millions 

  



 

 we expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing placement of fulfillment centers negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

net sales by similar products and services were as follows in millions 



 

 

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

  



operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

cost of sales 

cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital content where we are the seller of record including prime instant video inbound and outbound shipping charges and packaging supplies shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers 

the increase  in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product digital content and shipping costs resulting from increased sales as well as from expansion of digital offerings 

consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows 

  



gross margin increased  in 2013  compared to the comparable prior year periods primarily due to services sales increasing as a percentage of total sales services sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees and nonretail activities such as aws advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements we believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations 

and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase  in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and services sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we evaluate our facility requirements as necessary 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense 

the increase  in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels such as our sponsored search programs and our associates program payroll and related expenses and television advertising 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure including aws expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services as well as in technology infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure 

the increase  in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses including those associated with our initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services and increased spending on technology infrastructure including aws we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in these areas by increasing payroll and related expenses and adding technology infrastructure 

for 2013  2012  and 2011  we capitalized 581 million  including 87 million  of stockbased compensation 454 million  including 74 million  of stockbased compensation and 307 million  including 51 million  of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 451 million  327 million  and 236 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  a majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us most of which are allocated to our north america segment infrastructure other technology and operating costs incurred to support aws are included in technology and content 

general and administrative 

the increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation was 11 billion  833 million  and 557 million  during 2013  2012  and 2011  the increase  in 2013  2012  and 2011  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in the number of stockbased compensation awards granted to existing and new employees 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 114 million  159 million  and 154 million  during 2013  2012  and 2011  and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets partially offset by the settlement of certain unclaimed property and indemnification claims in q3 2013 

income from operations 

for the reasons discussed above income from operations increased  10 in 2013  decreased 22 in 2012  and decreased 39 in 2011  

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 38 million  40 million  and 61 million  during 2013  2012  and 2011  we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

the primary components of our interest expense are related to our longterm debt and capital and financing lease arrangements interest expense was 141 million  92 million  and 65 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  

our longterm debt was 32 billion  and 31 billion  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  our other longterm liabilities were 42 billion  and 23 billion  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and note 7—other longterm liabilities” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 136 million  80 million  and 76 million  during 2013  2012  and 2011  the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreigncurrency gains losses on intercompany balances 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments audit developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 161 million  428 million  and 291 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  our effective tax rate in 2013  was lower than the 35 us federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate in 2012  primarily due to the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions a decline in the proportion of our losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit and the retroactive extension of the us federal research and development credit which expired in december 2013 the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily relates to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries reduce our pretax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate in 2013 we recognized tax benefits for a greater proportion of these losses as compared to 2012 we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit 

in 2012 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 us federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate in 2011 primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign jurisdiction losses of subsidiaries primarily located outside of europe for which we may not realize a tax benefit the adverse impact of these losses was partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily related to our european operations additionally our effective tax rate in 2012 was more volatile as compared to 2011 due to the lower level of pretax income generated during the year relative to our tax expense our effective tax rate in 2012 was also adversely impacted by acquisitions including integrations audit developments nondeductible expenses and changes in tax law such as the expiration of the us federal research and development credit at the end of 2011 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as of december 31 2013  our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 275 million  and we had approximately 295 million  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax was 71 million  155 million  and 12 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  details of the activity are provided below in millions 

  



effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions 

  



 

 nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of “free cash flow” operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by used in operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment including internaluse software and website development” which are included in cash flow from investing activities we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flow from operations since purchases of property and equipment including internaluse software and website development are a necessary component of ongoing operations 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt property and equipment acquired under capital leases and other leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash 

payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions 

  



operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is provided to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “marketing” “technology and content” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher 

information regarding the effect of exchange rates versus the us dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period 

guidance 

we provided guidance on january 30 2014  in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as set forth below these forwardlooking statements reflect amazoncom’s expectations as of january 30 2014  and are subject to substantial uncertainty our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce as well as those outlined in item 1a of part i “risk factors”

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2013  in millions except percentages 

  



as of december 31 2013  we had 39 billion  of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in three tranches 750 million of 065 notes due in 2015 10 billion of 120 notes due in 2017 and 13 billion of 250 notes due in 2022 the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our debt was 39 billion as of december 31 2013  

foreign exchange risk 

during 2013  net sales from our international segment accounted for 40  of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca  which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros british pounds japanese yen and chinese yuan the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2013  international segment revenues decreased   13 billion  in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds as of december 31 2013  of 56 billion  an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 280 million 560 million and 11 billion all investments are classified as “availableforsale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances as of december 31 2013  an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 55 million 120 million and 270 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2013  our recorded basis in equity investments was 127 million these investments primarily relate to equity and cost method investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a risk factors tableend please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and digital media devices and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to 

  

claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as international ecommerce and other online services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

the people’s republic of china “prc” regulates amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in the prc through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet it infrastructure retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals although we believe these structures comply with existing prc laws they involve unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc 

  

government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if our chinese business interests were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition the chinese businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash 

  

equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce services to other businesses through our seller programs and other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 

  

  

  

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros japanese yen british pounds and chinese yuan if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security 

  

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

  

we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce and electronic devices existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

  

we do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions 

us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales however an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose obligations on outofstate retailers to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses by acquisitions including integrations and investments by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations with a number of countries actively considering changes in this regard in addition we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain 

  

third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements such as maintaining capital and segregating funds and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our consumerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell kindle devices generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as services sales we also offer other services such as aws fulfillment publishing digital content subscriptions advertising and cobranded credit cards 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1 per share free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 470 million and 468 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 

 

    

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our websites our kindle devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 4 was 9 10 and 11 for 2012 2011 and 2010 we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 5 were 76 74 and 72 for 2012 2011 and 2010 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists software engineers and merchandising employees we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories and offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and devices we are also investing in aws which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which 

 

     

may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category 

these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance at december 31 2012 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 60 million 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october 1 we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a 10 decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december 31 2012 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

  

financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a shortterm swing or a longerterm trend as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged 20 decrease from our december 31 2012 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly a 1 change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately 22 million impact on our 2012 operating income our estimated forfeiture rates at december 31 2012 and 2011 were 27 and 28 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense for example over 50 of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses by acquisitions including integrations and investments by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations with a number of countries actively considering changes in this regard in addition we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows in millions 

 

 our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 395 million for 2012 compared to 21 billion and 25 billion for 2011 and 2010 see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the decrease in free cash flow in 2012 and 2011 compared to the comparable prior year periods was primarily due to increased capital expenditures partially offset by higher operating cash flows operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures and our net income working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 114 billion 96 billion and 88 billion at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 amounts held in foreign currencies were 51 billion 41 billion and 34 billion at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 and were primarily euros british pounds japanese yen and chinese yuan 

cash provided by operating activities was 42 billion 39 billion and 35 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers advertising agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase in operating cash flow in 2012 compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to increases in noncash expenses partially offset by the decrease in net income additions to unearned revenue and changes in working capital partially offset by increased tax benefits on excess stockbased compensation deductions the increase in operating cash flow in 2011 compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily due to additions to unearned revenue increases in sales of gift certificates to our customers decreased tax benefits on excess stockbased compensation deductions and the increase in net income excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by changes in working capital 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash used in investing activities was 36 billion 19 billion and 34 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures and changes in cash paid for acquisitions and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments capital expenditures were 38 billion 18 billion and 979 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 with the increases primarily reflecting the purchase of property in 2012 and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including aws and additional capacity to support our fulfillment 

  

operations during all three periods we expect this trend to continue over time the purchase of property in 2012 included the acquisition of 11 buildings comprising 18 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in seattle washington for 14 billion capital expenditures included 381 million 256 million and 176 million for internaluse software and website development during 2012 2011 and 2010 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2012 2011 and 2010 we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 745 million 705 million and 352 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 23 billion 482 million and 181 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of longterm debt payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of longterm debt were 588 million 444 million and 221 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 we repurchased 53 million shares of common stock for 960 million in 2012 and 15 million shares of common stock for 277 million in 2011 under the 20 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january 2010 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt and tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions proceeds from longterm debt and other were 34 billion 177 million and 143 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 during 2012 cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of 30 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in three tranches 750 million of 065 notes due in 2015 10 billion of 120 notes due in 2017 and 13 billion of 250 notes due in 2022 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt” for additional discussion of the notes tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 429 million 62 million and 259 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 we recorded net tax provisions of 428 million 291 million and 352 million a majority of this provision is noncash we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income except as required under us tax law we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings at december 31 2012 cash held by foreign subsidiaries was 43 billion which include undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the us of 21 billion cash taxes paid net of refunds were 112 million 33 million and 75 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 as of december 31 2012 our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 89 million we also have approximately 136 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities as we utilize our federal tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 8—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged securities purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 38 billion at december 31 2012 purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancelable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 9 10 and 11 for 2012 2011 and 2010 we expect variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 

  

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive officer reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales 

net sales include product and services sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital content where we are the seller of record services sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees digital content subscriptions and nonretail activities net sales information is as follows in millions 

 

 sales increased 27 41 and 40 in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods changes in currency exchange rates impacted net sales by 854 million 11 billion and 86 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

  

north america sales grew 30 43 and 46 in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales partially offset by a higher percentage of sales by marketplace sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings 

international sales grew 23 38 and 33 in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales partially offset by a higher percentage of sales by marketplace sellers increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by 853 million 11 billion and 107 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales 

supplemental information 

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows in millions 

 

  

   we expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing placement of fulfillment centers negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

  

net sales by similar products and services were as follows in millions 

 

  

   

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

 

 operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

cost of sales 

cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital content where we are the seller of record including prime instant video inbound and outbound shipping charges and packaging supplies shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers 

the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product digital content and shipping costs resulting from increased sales as well as from expansion of digital offerings 

consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows 

 

 gross margin increased in 2012 compared to the comparable prior year periods primarily due to services sales increasing as a percentage of total sales we believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

  

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and services sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we evaluate our facility requirements as necessary 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense 

the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels such as sponsored search programs and our associates program payroll and related expenses and television advertising 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure including aws digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories and offerings so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure 

the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses including those associated with our digital initiatives and increased spending on technology infrastructure including aws we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in these areas by increasing payroll and related expenses and adding technology infrastructure 

for 2012 2011 and 2010 we capitalized 454 million including 74 million of stockbased compensation 307 million including 51 million of stockbased compensation and 213 million including 

  

38 million of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 327 million 236 million and 184 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 a majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us most of which are allocated to our north america segment infrastructure other technology and operating costs incurred to support aws are included in technology and content 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation was 833 million 557 million and 424 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 the increase in 2012 2011 and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in total stockbased compensation value granted to our employees and to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 159 million 154 million and 106 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 in 2012 2011 and 2010 the amounts primarily related to amortization of intangible assets 

income from operations 

for the reasons discussed above income from operations decreased 22 in 2012 decreased 39 in 2011 and increased 25 in 2010 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 40 million 61 million and 51 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

the primary component of our interest expense is related to our longterm debt and capital and financing lease arrangements interest expense was 92 million 65 million and 39 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 

our longterm debt was 31 billion and 255 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 our other longterm liabilities were 23 billion and 24 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and note 7—other longterm liabilities” for additional information 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 80 million 76 million and 79 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreigncurrency gains losses on intercompany balances 

  

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments audit developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 428 million 291 million and 352 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 our effective tax rate in 2012 2011 and 2010 is significantly affected by two factors the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the adverse effect of losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit primarily generated by subsidiaries located outside of europe reduce our pretax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we have recorded a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets 

in 2012 the adverse impact of such foreign jurisdiction losses was partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions additionally our effective tax rate in 2012 was more volatile as compared to prior years due to the lower level of pretax income generated during the year relative to our tax expense our effective tax rate in 2012 was also adversely impacted by acquisitions including integrations and investments audit developments nondeductible expenses and changes in tax law such as the expiration of the us federal research and development credit at the end of 2011 these items collectively caused our annual effective tax rate to be higher than both the 35 us federal statutory rate and our effective tax rates in 2011 and 2010 these items may also cause our effective tax rate in 2013 to be higher than the 35 us federal statutory rate 

in 2011 and 2010 the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions offset the adverse impact of foreign jurisdiction losses and as a result the effective tax rate in both years was lower than the 35 us federal statutory rate 

we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as of december 31 2012 our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 89 million we also have approximately 136 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities 

in january 2013 legislation was enacted to extend the federal research and development credit and other favorable tax benefits through december 31 2013 as a result we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit for the research and development credit and other favorable tax benefits that were extended retroactively to january 1 2012 

  

equitymethod investment activity net of tax 

equitymethod investment activity net of tax was 155 million 12 million and 7 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 details of the activity are provided below in millions 

 

 effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data 

 

  

  nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of “free cash flow” operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by used in operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of property and equipment including internaluse software and website 

  

development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions 

 

 operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is provided to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “technology and content” “marketing” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher 

information regarding the effect of exchange rates versus the us dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period 

guidance 

we provided guidance on january 29 2013 in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as set forth below these forwardlooking statements reflect amazoncom’s expectations as of january 29 2013 and are subject to substantial uncertainty our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce as well as those outlined in item 1a of part i “risk factors”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2012 in millions except percentages 

 

   

at december 31 2012 we had 37 billion of debt including the current portion primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in three tranches 750 million of 065 notes due in 2015 10 billion of 120 notes due in 2017 and 13 billion of 250 notes due in 2022 the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our debt was 37 billion at december 31 2012 

foreign exchange risk 

during 2012 net sales from our international segment accounted for 43 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros british pounds japanese yen and chinese yuan the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2012 international segment revenues decreased 853 million in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2012 of 51 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 255 million 515 million and 10 billion all investments are classified as “available for sale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances at december 31 2012 an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 10 million 20 million and 40 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2012 our recorded basis in equity investments was 140 million these investments primarily relate to equity and cost method investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a risk factors tableend please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and digital media devices and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations 

  

systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as the international ecommerce channel grows competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

  

the people’s republic of china “prc” regulates amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in the prc through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet it infrastructure retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals although we believe these structures comply with existing prc laws they involve unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if our chinese business interests were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition the chinese businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our 

websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we 

  

sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce services to other businesses through our seller programs and other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 

  

  

  

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros japanese yen and british pounds if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches 

as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business although we 

  

have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security in addition we rely on third party technology and systems in certain aspects of our businesses including for encryption and authentication technology to securely transmit confidential information 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce and electronic devices existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste electronic contracts and other 

  

communications consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

we do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions 

us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales however an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose obligations on outofstate retailers to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would require sales tax collection under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses by acquisitions by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

  

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1 per share free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 468 million and 465 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

    

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure and aws to build enhance and add features to our websites our kindle devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 4 was 10 11 and 12 for 2011 2010 and 2009 we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 5 were 74 72 and 68 for 2011 2010 and 2009 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists software engineers and merchandising employees we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiencies and support aws we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and devices we are also investing in aws which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category 

these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance at december 31 2011 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 50 million 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october 1 we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a 10 decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december 31 2011 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine 

  

whether credit or stock price changes are a shortterm swing or a longerterm trend as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged 20 decrease from our december 31 2011 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly a 1 change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately 24 million impact on our 2011 operating income our estimated forfeiture rates at december 31 2011 and 2010 were 28 and 30 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense under this method over 50 of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term if forfeited early in the life of an award the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax positions and determining our provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made as well as prior and subsequent periods 

if we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stockbased compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows 

 

 our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 209 billion for 2011 compared to 252 billion and 292 billion for 2010 and 2009 see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the decrease in free cash flow in 2011 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and changes in working capital partially offset by increases in sales of gift certificates to our customers decreased tax benefits on excess stockbased compensation deductions and increases in net income excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expense the decrease in free cash flow in 2010 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures changes in working capital and utilization of excess stockbased compensation deductions partially offset by increases in net income excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expense tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows accordingly as such tax benefits decline a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures and our federal taxable income working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 96 billion 88 billion and 64 billion at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 amounts held in foreign currencies were 41 billion 34 billion and 28 billion at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

cash provided by operating activities was 39 billion 35 billion and 33 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns as well as changes to noncash items such as excess stockbased compensation and deferred taxes 

cash used in investing activities corresponds with capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash used in investing activities was 19 billion 34 billion and 23 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures and changes in cash paid for acquisitions and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments capital expenditures were 18 billion 979 million and 373 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in 

  

support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including aws and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations we expect this trend to continue over time capital expenditures included 256 million 176 million and 146 million for internaluse software and website development during 2011 2010 and 2009 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2011 2010 and 2009 we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and investment activity of 705 million 352 million and 40 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 482 million 181 million and 280 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 cash outflows from financing activities result from payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements repurchases of common stock and repayments of longterm debt payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of longterm debt were 444 million 221 million and 472 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 15 million shares of common stock for 277 million in 2011 under the 2 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january 2010 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long termdebt and proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions proceeds from longterm debt and other were 177 million 143 million and 87 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 62 million 259 million and 105 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded net tax provisions of 291 million 352 million and 253 million a majority of this provision is noncash we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income except as required under us tax law we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us at december 31 2011 amounts held by foreign subsidiaries were 36 billion which include undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the us of 20 billion if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate them cash taxes paid net of refunds were 33 million 75 million and 48 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 as of december 31 2011 our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 384 million we also have approximately 273 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities once we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 7—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged securities purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 3 billion at december 31 2011 purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancelable in full or in part through the contractual provisions 

on average our high inventory turnover means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 10 11 and 12 for 2011 2010 and 2009 we expect variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including category expansion and changes in our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 

we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further 

  

strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales 

net sales include product and services sales product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital content where we are the seller of record services sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees digital content subscriptions and nonretail activities net sales information is as follows 

 

 sales increased 41 40 and 28 in 2011 2010 and 2009 changes in currency exchange rates positively negatively affected net sales by 11 billion 86 million and 182 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

the north america sales growth rate was 43 46 and 25 in 2011 2010 and 2009 the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings additionally north america sales growth reflects increased aws activity 

  

the international sales growth rate was 38 33 and 31 in 2011 2010 and 2009 the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers by a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased instock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively negatively affected international net sales by 11 billion 107 million and 174 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales 

supplemental information 

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

 

  

  we expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate to the extent our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category to the extent we reduce shipping rates to the extent we use more expensive shipping methods and to the extent we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers 

  

net sales by similar products and services were as follows 

 

  

   

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

 

 operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

cost of sales 

cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital content where we are the seller of record inbound and outbound shipping charges and packaging supplies shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers 

the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2011 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product digital content including prime instant video and shipping costs resulting from increased sales 

consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows 

 

 gross margin for 2011 remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods we believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

  

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2011 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with physical and digital product and services sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we evaluate our facility requirements as necessary 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense 

the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2011 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels such as sponsored search programs and our associates program payroll and related expenses and in 2011 and 2010 television and print advertising 

while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms digital initiatives aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings as well as technology infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2011 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure and increases in payroll and related expenses spending in technology and content significantly increased in 2011 and we expect this trend to continue over time as we invest in these areas by adding technology infrastructure and increasing payroll and related expenses see “overview” for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation 

for 2011 2010 and 2009 we capitalized 307 million including 51 million of stockbased compensation 213 million including 38 million of stockbased compensation and 187 million including 35 million of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of 

  

previously capitalized amounts was 236 million 184 million and 172 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 a majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us most of which are allocated to our north america segment infrastructure and other technology costs used to support aws are included in technology and content 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2011 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation was 557 million 424 million and 341 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 the increase in 2011 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in total stockbased compensation value granted to our employees and to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 154 million 106 million and 102 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 in 2011 2010 and 2009 the amounts primarily related to amortization of intangible assets and additionally in 2009 a 51 million legal settlement 

income from operations 

for the reasons discussed above income from operations decreased 39 in 2011 and increased 25 and 34 in 2010 and 2009 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 61 million 51 million and 37 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

the primary component of our interest expense is related to our capital and financing leases and our longterm debt interest expense was 65 million 39 million and 34 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 

our longterm liabilities were 26 billion and 16 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm liabilities” 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 76 million 79 million and 29 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreigncurrency gains on intercompany balances 

income taxes 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 291 million 352 million and 253 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 the effective tax rate in 2011 2010 and 2009 was lower than the 35 us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in 

  

the us earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us primarily relate to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg the favorable effective tax rate impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions is offset by other items principally losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we may not able to realize a related tax benefit depending upon the jurisdictional mix and amount of our income in 2012 the losses for which we may not receive a tax benefit in 2012 could result in an effective tax rate that is higher than the 35 us federal statutory rate 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our taxable income the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates business acquisitions and investments foreign exchange rates and expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as of december 31 2011 our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately 384 million we also have approximately 273 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities once we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase as a result of us legislation enacted in december 2010 we accelerated our depreciation deductions for qualifying property acquired in 2010 and 2011 

equity–method investment activity net of tax 

equity–method investment gains losses net of tax were 12 million 7 million and 6 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 the increase in equitymethod investment activity in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to 175 million of equitymethod losses partially offset by gains of 163 million as a result of reductions in our equity ownership through dilution and a recovery on the sale of an equity position the increase in equitymethod investment activity in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the recognition of a noncash gain on a previously held equity position in a company that was acquired in 2010 

effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data 

 

  

  nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of “free cash flow” operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statement of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 

  

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by used in operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by operating activities” for 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is provided to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “technology and content” “marketing” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher 

information regarding the effect of exchange rates versus the us dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period 

guidance 

we provided guidance on january 31 2012 in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as set forth below these forwardlooking statements reflect amazoncom’s expectations as of january 31 2012 our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below 

first quarter 2012 guidance 

 

   

  

 these projections are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2011 in millions except percentages 

 

   

foreign exchange risk 

during 2011 net sales from our international segment accounted for 44 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2011 international segment revenues increased 11 billion in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2011 of 41 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 205 million 405 million and 815 million all investments are classified as “availableforsale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances at december 31 2011 an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 55 million 110 million and 220 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2011 our recorded basis in equity investments was 266 million these investments primarily relate to equitymethod investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

the board of directors and shareholders 

amazoncom inc 

we have audited amazoncom inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria amazoncom inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion amazoncom inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of amazoncom inc as of december 31 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 of amazoncom inc and our report dated january 31 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1a risk factors tableend please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and digital media devices and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

  

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 

  

 we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as the international ecommerce channel grows competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

in 2004 we acquired joyocom limited which is organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and through a people’s republic of china “prc” entity provides technology and services for the joyo amazon 

  

websites the prc regulates joyo amazon’s business through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyo amazon’s business is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly of partially by prc nationals although we believe joyo amazon’s structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyo amazon including its subsidiary and affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyo amazon were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our 

  

fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce services to other businesses through our seller programs and other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 

  

  

  

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

   

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros japanese yen and british pounds if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy 

we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system 

  

interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

  

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce and electronic devices existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 

we do not collect sales or other taxes on shipments of most of our goods into most states in the us under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record and we are obligated to collect sales tax in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional agreements requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of them along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations 

currently us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the 

  

us congress have been considering or adopted initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if these initiatives are successful we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states or change our business practices the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors and decrease our future sales 

we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites additional foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us 

a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our worldwide provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant suppliers including licensors that are important to our sourcing manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations 

our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability 

  

claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business 

we could be liable for breaches of security 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent fraudulent transactions data loss and other security breaches failure to prevent or mitigate such breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our consumerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third party sellers and we also manufacture and sell the kindle ereader generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers we also offer services such as aws fulfillment miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements such as online advertising and cobranded credit cards 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1 per share free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives which generally require us to hire additional software engineers computer scientists and merchandisers to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 465 million and 461 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and 

 

   

preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure and aws to build enhance and add features to our websites and our kindle ereader and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 11 12 and 12 for 2010 2009 and 2008 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 72 68 and 62 for 2010 2009 and 2008 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists software engineers and merchandising employees we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiencies and support aws we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives we are investing in aws which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business and in our kindle ereader a continuing challenge is to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

 

     

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category 

these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance at december 31 2010 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 33 million 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october 1 we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a 10 decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december 31 2010 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to 

  

determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longerterm trend as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged 20 decrease from our december 31 2010 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly a 1 change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately 17 million impact on our 2010 operating income our estimated forfeiture rates at december 31 2010 and 2009 were 297 and 331 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense under this method over 50 of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term the accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity of estimating forfeitures if forfeited early in the life of an award the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

if we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stockbased compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—recent accounting pronouncements” 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows 

 

 our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 252 billion for 2010 compared to 292 billion and 136 billion for 2009 and 2008 see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the decrease in free cash flow in 2010 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures changes in working capital and utilization of excess stockbased compensation deductions partially offset by increases in operating income the increase in free cash flow in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in working capital increased operating income and increased deferred revenue tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows accordingly as such tax benefits decline a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 88 billion 64 billion and 37 billion at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 amounts held in foreign currencies were 34 billion 28 billion and 17 billion at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

cash provided by operating activities was 35 billion 33 billion and 17 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns as well as changes to noncash items such as excess stockbased compensation and deferred taxes 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities capital expenditures including leasehold improvements internaluse software and website development costs and cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights cash provided by used in investing activities was 34 billion 23 billion and 12 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 with the variability caused primarily by increased capital expenditures increases in cash paid for acquisitions and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments capital expenditures were 979 million 373 million and 333 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth including investments in technology infrastructure including aws additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in 2010 investments in corporate office space we expect this trend to continue over time 

  

capital expenditures included 176 million 146 million and 128 million for internaluse software and website development during 2010 2009 and 2008 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2010 2009 and 2008 we made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and investment activity of 352 million 40 million and 494 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 181 million 280 million and 198 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 cash outflows from financing activities result from payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements repayments of longterm debt and repurchases of common stock payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of longterm debt were 221 million 472 million and 355 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 we repurchased 22 million shares of common stock for 100 million in 2008 under the 1 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in february 2008 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and proceeds from longterm debt proceeds from longterm debt and other were 143 million 87 million and 98 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows outflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 259 million 105 million and 159 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 we recorded net tax provisions of 352 million 253 million and 247 million a majority of this provision is noncash we have current tax benefits and net operating loss carryforwards relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income cash taxes paid net of refunds were 75 million 48 million and 53 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 we used substantially all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2010 and have available federal tax credits of 227 million once we use our credits we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

in january 2010 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 2 billion of our common stock which replaces the prior february 2008 repurchase authorization described above we did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2010 or 2009 

additionally in november 2010 and january 2011 we signed agreements to acquire quidsi inc and lovefilm international limited for aggregate consideration of approximately 660 million primarily in cash and the assumption of debt we expect the acquisitions to close in 2011 subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged securities purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 15 billion at december 31 2010 

on average our high inventory turnover means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 11 12 and 12 for 2010 2009 and 2008 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including category expansion and changes in our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 

we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further 

  

strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales 

net sales information is as follows 

 

 sales increased 40 28 and 29 in 2010 2009 and 2008 changes in currency exchange rates positively negatively affected net sales by 86 million 182 million and 127 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

the north america sales growth rate was 46 25 and 26 in 2010 2009 and 2008 the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise and in 2010 our adoption of the new accounting standard update “asu” 200913 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime by increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings and by the impact of zappos which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

the international sales growth rate was 33 31 and 33 in 2010 2009 and 2008 the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales and a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and by increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively negatively affected international net sales by 107 million 174 million and 131 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales 

sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 31 30 and 28 of unit sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount because we focus on operating profits we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller 

supplemental information 

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

 

  

  we expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our freeshipping offers at an increasing rate including through membership in amazon prime to the extent our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category to the extent we reduce shipping rates and to the extent we use more expensive shipping methods we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping offers as well as through membership in amazon prime 

  

supplemental information about our net sales is as follows 

 

  

   

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

 

 operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

cost of sales 

cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and content where we are the seller of record inbound and outbound shipping charges and packaging supplies shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers 

the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales 

  

consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows 

 

 gross margin for 2010 remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods we believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services 

fulfillment 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with sales volume inventory levels and product sales mix payment processing and related transaction costs and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we evaluate our facility requirements as necessary 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense 

the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels such as sponsored search programs and our associates program and in 2010 on television advertising 

while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping offers and amazon prime as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiency and support aws see “overview” for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation 

  

the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and increased spending on technology infrastructure we expect these trends to continue over time 

for the years ended 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized 213 million 187 million and 187 million of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 184 million 172 million and 143 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 

a majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us most of which are allocated to our north america segment infrastructure and other technology costs used to support aws are included in technology and content 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation was 424 million 341 million and 275 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 the increase in stockbased compensation in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in total stockbased compensation value granted to our employees and to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate the increase in stockbased compensation in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 106 million 102 million and 24 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 in 2010 the amount primarily related to amortization of intangible assets in 2009 the amount included amortization of intangible assets and a 51 million legal settlement and in 2008 the balance included amortization of intangible assets and a 53 million noncash gain on the sale of our european dvd rental assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 51 million 37 million and 83 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

the primary component of our net interest expense is related to our capital and financing leases and our longterm debt interest expense was 39 million 34 million and 71 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 the decline in 2009 primarily relates to principal reductions of long term debt of 319 million 

our longterm liabilities were 16 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm liabilities” 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 79 million 29 million and 47 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreigncurrency gain on intercompany balances 

  

income taxes 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 352 million 253 million and 247 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 the effective tax rate in 2010 2009 and 2008 was lower than the 35 us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the us 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our taxable income the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates business acquisitions and investments and foreign currencies we have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income we used substantially all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2010 and have available federal tax credits of 227 million as a result of new us legislation that became effective in december 2010 we are able to accelerate our depreciation deductions for qualifying property acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010 this accelerated depreciation deduction will continue for qualifying property acquired in 2011 

equity–method investment activity net of tax 

equity–method investment activity net of tax was 7 million 6 million and 9 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 the increase in equitymethod investment activity in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the recognition of a noncash gain on a previously held equity position in a company that was acquired in 2010 

effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data 

 

  

     

nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measures of “free cash flow” operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statement of operations meet the definition of nongaap financial measures 

free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by used in operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2010 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is provided to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “technology and content” “marketing” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher 

information regarding the effect of exchange rates versus the us dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2010 in millions except percentages 

 

   

foreign exchange risk 

during 2010 net sales from our international segment accounted for 45 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include british pounds euros and japanese yen the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2010 international segment revenues decreased 107 million in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2010 of 34 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 172 million 345 million and 689 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies based on the intercompany balances at december 31 2010 an assumed 5 10 and 20 adverse change to foreign currency exchange rates would result in losses of 40 million 90 million and 195 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see item 7 of part ii “effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2010 our recorded basis in equity investments was 279 million these investments primarily relate to equitymethod investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends recent sales or acquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

amazoncom inc 

we have audited amazoncom inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria amazoncom inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion amazoncom inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the coso criteria

 item 1a risk factors 

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and digital media devices and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

  

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new product or service offerings which include seller services digital web services and electronic devices these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as the international ecommerce channel grows competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

in 2004 we acquired joyocom limited which is organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and through a people’s republic of china “prc” entity provides technology and services for the joyo amazon websites the prc regulates joyo amazon’s business through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyo amazon’s business is operated by prc companies owned by nominee shareholders who are prc nationals although we 

  

believe joyo amazon’s structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyo amazon including its subsidiary and affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyo amazon were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

  

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce services to other businesses through our seller programs and other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as they expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 

  

  

  

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros british pounds and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales 

customer access to our websites and the speed with which a customer navigates and makes purchases on our websites affect our net sales operating results and the attractiveness of our products and services we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders 

  

and providing services which would make our product and service offerings less attractive our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

  

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation of the internet ecommerce and other aspects of our business is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce and electronic devices existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 

we do not collect sales or other taxes on shipments of most of our goods into most states in the us under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record and we are obligated to collect sales tax in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional agreements requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of them along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations 

  

currently us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering or adopted initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if these initiatives are successful we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states or change our business practices the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors and decrease our future sales 

we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites additional foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us 

a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our worldwide provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our vendor relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant vendors that are important to our sourcing manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

  

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue and generate high margins if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business 

we could be liable for breaches of security 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our customerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third party sellers and we also manufacture and sell the kindle ereader generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers we also offer services such as amazon web services cobranded credit cards fulfillment and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers such as online advertising 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1 per share free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives which generally require us to hire additional software engineers computer scientists and merchandisers to increase product sales we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery times increasing selection increasing product categories expanding product information improving ease of use and earning customer trust we generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages 

we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures consisting of vested and unvested awards total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 461 million and 446 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

   

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and most aspects of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure build enhance and add features to our websites and our kindle ereader and build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct to content provider and manufacturer sourcing maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 12 12 and 13 for 2009 2008 and 2007 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 68 62 and 57 for 2009 2008 and 2007 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists software engineers and employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying merchandising selection and systems support we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives we are investing in amazon web services which provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business and in our kindle ereader a continuing challenge is to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

 

     

in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category 

these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance at december 31 2009 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 23 million 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october 1 we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment penetration and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

during the year management monitors the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment test a 10 decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december 31 2009 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

  

financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longerterm trend as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged 20 decrease from our december 31 2009 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize the expense as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class current economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly a 1 change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have an approximately 13 million impact on our 2009 consolidated operating income our estimated forfeiture rates at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 331 and 371 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense under this method over 50 of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term the accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures if forfeited early in the life of an award the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

if we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stockbased compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows 

 

 our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 292 billion for 2009 compared to 136 billion and 118 billion for 2008 and 2007 see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the increase in free cash flow in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in working capital increased operating income and increased deferred revenue the increase in free cash flow in 2008 primarily resulted from increased operating income offset by increased capital expenditures tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows accordingly as such tax benefits decline a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 64 billion 37 billion and 31 billion at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 amounts held in foreign currencies were 28 billion 17 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

cash provided by operating activities was 33 billion 17 billion and 14 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers from sellers and from nonretail activities such as marketing and promotional agreements amazon web services other seller services and our cobranded credit card agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm debt obligations cash received from customers sellers developers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns as well as changes to noncash items such as excess stockbased compensation and deferred taxes 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash outlays for acquisitions equitymethod investments and intellectual property rights and purchases of fixed assets including leasehold improvements and internaluse software and website development costs cash provided by used in investing activities was 23 billion 12 billion and 42 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 with the variability caused primarily by purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments partially offset by decreases in cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures were 373 million 333 million and 224 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure fulfillmentrelated assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites in 2010 we plan to significantly increase 

  

our capital expenditures for additional investments in corporate office space and in support of continued business growth including capacity to support our fulfillment operations and amazon web services capital expenditures included 146 million 128 million and 108 million for internaluse software and website development during 2009 2008 and 2007 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2009 2008 and 2007 we made payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and investment activity of 40 million 494 million and 75 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 280 million 198 million and 50 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of longterm debt payments on capital lease obligations and repurchases of common stock repayments on longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations were 472 million 355 million and 74 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 repayments on longterm debt include 319 million on our 6875 premium adjustable convertible securities “peacs” in 2009 and 294 million on our 475 convertible subordinated notes in 2008 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” we repurchased 22 million shares of common stock for 100 million in 2008 under the 1 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in february 2008 we repurchased 63 million shares of common stock for 248 million in 2007 under the 500 million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in august 2006 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows outflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 105 million 159 million and 257 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 we recorded net tax provisions of 253 million 247 million and 184 million a majority of this provision is noncash we have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as such cash taxes paid net of refunds were 48 million 53 million and 24 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 as our federal and state net operating losses and tax credits are utilized cash paid for taxes will increase we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

in august 2006 our board of directors authorized a 24month program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock pursuant to which we repurchased 252 million and 248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007 respectively in april 2007 our board authorized a new 24month program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock which was replaced in february 2008 by a 24month program to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock we repurchased 100 million of our common stock in 2008 under the february 2008 board authorization we did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2009 in january 2010 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 2 billion of our common stock which replaces the board’s prior authorization 

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 7—commitments and contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged securities purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 10 billion at december 31 2009 

on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 12 12 and 13 for 2009 2008 and 2007 inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix and our continuing focus on instock inventory availability which enables faster delivery of products to our customers we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 

  

we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales and gross profit 

net sales information is as follows 

 

 revenue increased 28 29 and 39 in 2009 2008 and 2007 changes in currency exchange rates positively negatively affected net sales by 182 million 127 million and 399 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 for a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

the north america revenue growth rate was 25 26 and 38 in 2009 2008 and 2007 the increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and by increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings as well as a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings 

  

the international revenue growth rate was 31 33 and 39 in 2009 2008 and 2007 the increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and by increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings as well as a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively negatively affected international net sales by 174 million 131 million and 390 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 

we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales additionally as we continue to offer increased selection lower prices and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase see “supplemental information” below 

gross profit information is as follows 

 

 the increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 corresponds with increases in sales offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and amazon prime generally our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including our product service and geographic mix of sales sales volumes by other sellers changes in vendor pricing including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances lowering prices for customers including from competitive pricing decisions improvements in product sourcing and inventory management and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and amazon prime offers such free shipping and amazon prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales we view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 30 28 and 28 of unit sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller 

gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “effect of exchange rates” below 

north america segment gross margins in 2009 increased by 125 basis points compared to 2008 resulting primarily from increases in other revenue improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing 

  

and increases in sales of products by other sellers partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise 

north america segment gross margins in 2008 decreased by 69 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise partially offset by increases in other revenue and improvements in vendor pricing 

international segment gross margins in 2009 decreased by 67 basis points compared to 2008 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and increases in sales of products by other sellers 

international segment gross margins in 2008 increased by 25 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers and improvements in vendor pricing partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise 

supplemental information 

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

 

  

  we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products as well as through membership in amazon prime to the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate including memberships in amazon prime our net cost of shipping will increase we seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies 

  

supplemental information about our net sales is as follows 

 

  

   

operating expenses 

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

 

 operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

fulfillment 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2009 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels our mix of product sales payment processing and related transaction costs including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain seller transactions and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we periodically evaluate our facility requirements 

  

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect 

marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels such as our associates program and sponsored search programs 

while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping offers and amazon prime as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services see “overview” for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure 

for the years ended 2009 2008 and 2007 we capitalized 187 million 187 million and 129 million of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 172 million 143 million and 116 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 

a significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us and most of them are allocated to our north america segment 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation was 341 million 275 million and 185 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 the increase in stockbased compensation in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate the increase in stockbased compensation in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in total stockbased compensation value granted to our employees 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 102 million 24 million and 9 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 the increase in other operating expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to the 51 million toysruscom llc settlement and increased amortization expense on acquired intangibles in 2008 we recognized a 53 million noncash gain on the sale of our european dvd rental assets 

interest income and expense 

our interest income was 37 million 83 million and 90 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

  

the primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our longterm debt instruments interest expense was 34 million 71 million and 77 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 with the decline primarily relating to principal reductions of 319 million in 2009 and 899 million in 2008 

our longterm debt was 109 million and 409 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

 income taxes 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 253 million 247 million and 184 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 the effective tax rate in 2009 2008 and 2007 was lower than the 35 us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the us 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including our accuracy in predicting our taxable income the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates business acquisitions and investments and foreign currencies we have current tax benefits net operating losses and tax credits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as such we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be noncash 

effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data 

 

  

   

  nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measure of “free cash flow” meets the definition of a nongaap financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by used in operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by used in operating activities” for 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions 

 

 in addition we provide information regarding our operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation we provide this information to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “technology and content” “marketing” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher 

  

guidance 

we provided guidance on january 28 2010 in our earnings release furnished on form 8k as follows 

first quarter 2010 guidance 

 

  

 as noted in item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—recent accounting pronouncements” we are prospectively adopting accounting standard update asu 200913 as of january 1 2010 the impact of the adoption of this standard is included in our first quarter 2010 guidance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

  

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2009 in millions except percentages 

 

 the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2008 in millions except percentages 

 

   

foreign exchange risk 

during 2009 net sales from our international segment accounted for 48 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include british pounds euros and japanese yen the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2009 international segment revenues decreased 174 million in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2009 of 28 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 140 million 275 million and 550 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency based on the intercompany balances at december 31 2009 of 260 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 strengthening of the us dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of 15 million 25 million and 50 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

see “effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2009 our recorded basis in equity investments was 91 million these investments primarily relate to equitymethod investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends recent sales or acquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

report of ernst  young llp independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders 

amazoncom inc 

we have audited amazoncom inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria amazoncom inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion amazoncom inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the coso criteria 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of amazoncom inc as of december 31 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 of amazoncom inc and our report dated january 28 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1a risk factors 

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks 

we face intense competition 

our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders ecommerce inherently more competitive than other retail increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

  

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new product or service offerings which include seller services digital web services and electronic devices these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition our gross profits in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally we have relatively little experience operating in these or future market segments and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

as the international ecommerce channel grows competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

in 2004 we acquired joyocom limited which is organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and through a people’s republic of china “prc” entity provides technology and services for the joyo amazon websites the prc regulates joyo amazon’s business through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyo amazon’s business is operated by prc companies owned by nominee shareholders who are prc nationals although we believe joyo amazon’s structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyo amazon including its subsidiary and affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyo amazon were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take 

  

significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce services to other businesses such as through our seller programs including webstore by amazon and fulfillment by amazon as well as through other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as they expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 

  

  

  

   

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased 

in addition our 6875 premium adjustable convertible securities due 2010 “6875 peacs” are denominated in euros and increases in the euro relative to the us dollar increase the us dollar amount we owe as interest and principal on the 6875 peacs we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros british pounds and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

  

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales 

customer access to our websites and the speed with which a customer navigates and makes purchases on our websites affect our net sales operating results and the attractiveness of our products and services we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which would make our product and service offerings less attractive our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we have outstanding debt and may incur additional debt in the future 

we have outstanding debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future as a result a significant portion of our future cash flow from operating activities may be dedicated to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on such indebtedness with no guarantee that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments or if we fail to comply with our debt covenants we will be in default we may not be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all and there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all a lack or high cost of credit could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions or other purposes in the future as needed to plan for or react to changes in technology and in our business and competition and to react in the event of an economic downturn 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers 

  

and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

  

government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or online services these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 

we do not collect sales or other taxes on shipments of most of our goods into most states in the us under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record and we are obligated to collect sales tax in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional agreements requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of them along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations 

currently us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering or adopted initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if these initiatives are successful we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors and decrease our future sales 

we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites additional foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us 

a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our worldwide provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

our vendor relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant vendors that are important to our sourcing manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions we may be unable to procure from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue and generate high margins if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business 

we could be liable for breaches of security on our websites 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

  

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1 per share free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives which generally require us to hire additional software engineers computer scientists and merchandisers to increase product sales we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery times increasing selection increasing product categories expanding product information improving ease of use and earning customer trust we generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages 

we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures consisting of vested and unvested awards and inthemoney and outofthemoney stock options total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 446 million 

 

   

and 435 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 these amounts exclude shares issuable upon conversion of our longterm debt in 2008 and 2007 we repurchased 22 million shares and 63 million shares of our common stock under repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and most aspects of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure build enhance and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct to content provider and manufacturer sourcing maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 12 13 and 13 for 2008 2007 and 2006 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 62 57 and 53 for 2008 2007 and 2006 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists software engineers and employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying merchandising selection and systems support we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives we are investing in amazon web services which provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business a continuing challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us 

 

     

economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured additionally revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 

we evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned 

product sales and shipping revenues net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier return allowances which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns are estimated using historical experience revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales taxes amounts paid in advance for subscription services including amounts received for amazon prime and 

  

other membership programs are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term for our products with multiple elements where a standalone value for each element cannot be established we recognize the revenue and related cost over the estimated economic life of the product 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction while inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “net sales” 

commissions and perunit fees received from sellers and similar amounts earned through other seller sites are recognized when the item is sold by the seller and our collectability is reasonably assured when we are responsible for fulfillmentrelated services commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer we record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category based on this evaluation we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value 

we provide fulfillmentrelated services in connection with certain of our agreements in those arrangements as well as other product sales by other sellers the seller maintains ownership of the related products as such these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 

investments 

we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds we also have equitymethod investments in private companies where we can exercise significant influence over but not control the entity we periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments are otherthantemporary this evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment factors considered include if applicable quoted market prices recent financial results and operating trends other publicly available information implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities or other conditions that may affect the value of our investments 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october 1 we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations if the fair value is determined to be less than book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of reporting units forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on projected category expansion pricing expectations market segment penetration and general economic conditions additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and 

  

developing revenue models in this process a fair value for goodwill is estimated and compared to its carrying value the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any 

the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longerterm trend 

internaluse software and website development 

included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internaluse software and website development including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business as required by statement of position sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internaluse software and amortize these costs over its estimated useful life of two years costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internaluse software are expensed as incurred 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than a straightline method for recognizing compensation expense under this method over 50 of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term the accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures if forfeited early in the life of an award the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audit the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered the majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards attributable to differences in stockbased compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns 

  

statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 we allocate our valuation allowance to current and longterm deferred tax assets on a prorata basis 

if we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stockbased compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions tax contingencies accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities sfas no 157 was effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years see “note 1—description of business and accounting policies” and “note 2—cash cash equivalents and marketable securities” for further discussion in february 2008 the fasb issued staff position fsp no 1572 which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis fsp 1572 is effective for us beginning january 1 2009 

those assets and liabilities measured at fair value under sfas no 157 in q1 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fsp 1572 we will measure the remaining assets and liabilities beginning q1 2009 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 157 as amended by fsp 1572 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 r business combinations  and sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas no 141 r requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity at their fair values on the acquisition date with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired sfas no 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent sfas no 141 r and sfas no 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is prohibited we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 141 r and sfas no 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp no 1423 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  fsp no 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to 

  

determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  fsp no 1423 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is prohibited we do not expect the adoption of fsp no 1423 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb ratified the consensus reached on eitf issue no 0705 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock  eitf issue no 0705 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock which would qualify as a scope exception under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  eitf issue no 0705 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 0705 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows 

 

 our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 136 billion for 2008 compared to 118 billion and 486 million for 2007 and 2006 see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the increase in free cash flow in 2008 primarily resulted from increased operating income offset by increased capital expenditures the increase in free cash flow in 2007 primarily resulted from increased operating income operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 37 billion 31 billion and 20 billion at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 amounts held in foreign currencies were 17 billion 12 billion and 623 million at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—income taxes” 

cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion 14 billion and 702 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers from sellers and from nonretail activities such as through our cobranded credit card agreements other seller services and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized pursuant to sop 981 that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm debt obligations cash received from customers sellers developers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash outlays for acquisitions equitymethod investments and intellectual property rights 

  

and purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development costs cash provided by used in investing activities was 12 billion 42 million and 333 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 with the variability caused primarily by purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments and acquisition activity capital expenditures were 333 million 224 million and 216 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure fulfillmentrelated assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites capital expenditures included 128 million 108 million and 108 million for internaluse software and website development during 2008 2007 and 2006 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows in 2008 2007 and 2006 we made payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and investment activity of 494 million 75 million and 32 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 198 million 50 million and 400 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock repayments of longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations we repurchased 22 million shares of common stock for 100 million in 2008 under the 1 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in february 2008 we repurchased 63 million shares of common stock for 248 million in 2007 and 82 million shares of common stock for 252 million in 2006 under the 500 million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in august 2006 repayments on longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations were 355 million 74 million and 383 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 repayments on longterm debt include 294 million on our 475 convertible subordinated notes in 2008 and €250 million 300 million of our 6875 peacs in 2006 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and exercises of employee stock options sfas no 123r accounting for stock based compensation  requires the reporting of tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions in financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 159 million 257 million and 102 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were 11 million 91 million and 35 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 we expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stockbased awards 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 we recorded net tax provisions of 247 million 184 million and 187 million a majority of this provision is noncash we have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as such cash taxes paid were 53 million 24 million and 15 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 as our federal and state net operating losses and tax credits are utilized cash paid for taxes will increase we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

in february 2008 our board of directors authorized a debt repurchase program replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase through open market repurchases or private transactions redeem or otherwise retire up to all of our outstanding 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2009 and 6875 peacs in 2008 we called for redemption all of the remaining principal amount of 899 million of our outstanding 475 convertible subordinated notes holders elected to convert 605 million in principal amount of the 475 convertible subordinated notes and we issued 78 million shares of our common stock as a result we redeemed the remaining 294 million of the called principal amount for cash at december 31 2008 the debt balance of our 475 convertible subordinated notes was zero and the debt balance of our 6875 peacs was 335 million 

in august 2006 our board of directors authorized a 24month program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock pursuant to which we repurchased 252 million and 248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007 respectively in april 2007 our board authorized a new 24month program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock which was replaced in february 2008 by a 24month program to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock we repurchased 100 million of our common stock in 2008 under the february 2008 board authorization 

  

since our 6875 peacs which are due in 2010 are denominated in euros our us dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the euro to us dollar exchange rate as a result any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and to the extent we make principal payments the amount of us dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement additionally since our interest payable on our 6875 peacs is due in euros the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment gains or losses on the remeasurement of our eurodenominated interest payable are classified as “other income expense net” on our consolidated statements of operations 

on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 12 13 and 13 for 2008 2007 and 2006 inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix and our continuing focus on instock inventory availability which enables faster delivery of products to our customers we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 

the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december 31 2008 

 

  

      

pledged securities 

we are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash and marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit guarantees debt and real estate leases we classify cash and marketable securities with use restrictions of twelve months or longer as noncurrent “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets the balance of pledged securities at december 31 2008 consisted of 308 million included in “other assets” the amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases based on our credit rating and changes in our market capitalization common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows 

 

  

  we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources our periodoverperiod revenue growth was 26 in 2006 39 in 2007 and 36 for the first three quarters of 2008 for q4 2008 our quarterly revenue growth rate declined to 18 driven primarily by decreased consumer demand following disruptions in the global financial markets and changes in foreign exchange rates excluding the 320 million unfavorable impact from yearoveryear changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the fourth quarter net sales would have grown 24 compared with q4 2007 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 14—quarterly results unaudited” 

  

net sales and gross profit 

net sales information is as follows 

 

 revenue increased 29 39 and 26 in 2008 2007 and 2006 reflecting revenue growth in both our north america and international segments additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by 127 million 399 million and 24 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 for a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

the north america revenue growth rate was 26 38 and 25 in 2008 2007 and 2006 the increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings 

the international revenue growth rate was 33 39 and 28 in 2008 2007 and 2006 the increase in revenue in each year reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively affected international net sales by 131 million 390 million and 18 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 

we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales additionally as we continue to offer increased selection lower prices and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase see “supplemental information” below 

  

gross profit information is as follows 

 

 the increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 corresponds with increases in sales offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and amazon prime generally our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including our product service and geographic mix of sales sales volumes by other sellers changes in vendor pricing including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances lowering prices for customers including from competitive pricing decisions improvements in product sourcing and inventory management and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and amazon prime offers such free shipping and amazon prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales we view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 29 28 and 28 of unit sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller 

gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “effect of exchange rates” below 

north america segment gross margins in 2008 decreased by 69 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise partially offset by increases in other revenue and improvements in vendor pricing 

north america segment gross margins in 2007 decreased by 90 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise 

international segment gross margins in 2008 increased by 25 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers and improvements in vendor pricing partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise 

  

international segment gross margins in 2007 increased by 38 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise 

supplemental information 

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

 

  

  we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products as well as through membership in amazon prime to the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate including memberships in amazon prime our net cost of shipping will increase we seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies 

  

supplemental information about our net sales is as follows 

 

  

   

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

 

 operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation”

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2008 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels our mix of product sales payment processing and related transaction costs including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain seller transactions and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales our sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

we expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2008 2007 and 2006 through gains in efficiencies and increases in leased warehouse space this expansion was designed to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide fulfillment services we periodically evaluate our facility requirements as necessary 

  

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect 

marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels such as our associates program and sponsored search programs 

while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping offers and amazon prime as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services see “overview” above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure 

for the years ended 2008 2007 and 2006 we capitalized 187 million 129 million and 123 million of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 143 million 116 million and 86 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 

a significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us and most of them are allocated to our north america segment 

general and administrative 

the increase in spending in general and administrative in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees 

stockbased compensation 

sfas no 123r requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 

stockbased compensation was 275 million 185 million and 101 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 the increase in stockbased compensation is primarily attributable to an increase in total stock compensation value granted to our employees 

  

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net was 24 million 9 million and 10 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 the increase in other operating income in 2008 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily attributable to the 53 million noncash gain recognized on the sale of our european dvd rental assets partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets other operating expense in 2007 and 2006 was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets 

income from operations 

income from operations was 842 million 655 million and 389 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 the increase in each year is primarily a result of increased revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses additionally 2008 includes the 53 million noncash gain on the sale of our european dvd rental assets included in “other operating expense income net” 

interest expense and income 

the primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our longterm debt instruments including our 475 convertible subordinated notes which were no longer outstanding at december 31 2008 and our 6875 peacs which had a principal balance of €240 million 335 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2008 interest expense was 71 million 77 million and 78 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 with the decline primarily relating to principal reductions of 899 million in 2008 and 300 million in 2006 

our total debt was 468 million and 13 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—longterm debt” 

our interest income was 83 million 90 million and 59 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consisted of the following 

 

  

    

income taxes 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 247 million 184 million and 187 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 the effective tax rate in 2008 and 2007 was lower than the 35 us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the us the effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35 us federal statutory rate resulting from establishment of our european headquarters in luxembourg which we expected to benefit our effective tax rate over time associated with the establishment of our european headquarters we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the us to international locations these transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions 

our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including from accurately predicting our taxable income the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates business acquisitions and investments and foreign currencies we have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as such we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be noncash 

effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data 

 

  

   nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measure of “free cash flow” meets the definition of a nongaap financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

  

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations in limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations however since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by operating activities” for 2008 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 in addition we provide operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation we provide this information to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “technology and content” “marketing” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher we compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stockbased awards in the footnotes to our financial statements stockbased compensation programs are an important element of our compensation structure and all forms of stockbased awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations

information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2008 in millions except percentages 

 

   

the following table provides information about our current and longterm cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2007 in millions except percentages 

 

 at december 31 2008 we had debt of 468 million primarily associated with our 6875 peacs which is due in 2010 the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

there was no amount of the 475 convertible subordinated notes outstanding at december 31 2008 based upon quoted market prices the fair value of the 475 convertible subordinated notes was 11 billion at december 31 2007 outstanding principal of 899 million the fair value of the 6875 peacs was 332 million at december 31 2008 and 358 million at december 31 2007 outstanding principal of €240 million 

foreign exchange risk 

during 2008 net sales from our international segment accounted for 47 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2008 international segment revenues increased 131 million in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2008 of 17 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 85 million 

  

170 million and 335 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” as defined by sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency based on the net intercompany balances at december 31 2008 of 150 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 strengthening of the us dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of 5 million 15 million and 30 million recorded to “other income expense net” 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our 6875 peacs which have an outstanding principal balance at december 31 2008 of €240 million 335 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2008 due to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio which we cannot predict our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6875 peacs since issuance in february 2000 has increased by 99 million as of december 31 2008 based on the outstanding 6875 peacs principal balance an assumed 5 10 and 20 weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro would result in additional losses of approximately 17 million 35 million and 65 million recorded to “other expense income net” additionally we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6875 peacs to protect against exchange rate fluctuations assuming the us dollar weakens against the euro by 5 10 and 20 we would incur 1 million 2 million and 5 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

see “effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2008 our recorded basis in equity investments was 90 million these investments primarily relate to equitymethod investments in private companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data the current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data as such we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable

 item 1a risk factors 

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition these risks are not the only ones we face 

we face intense competition 

our market segments are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing 

  

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders ecommerce inherently more competitive than other retail increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks 

we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new product or service offerings which include seller services digital web services and electronic devices these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition our gross profits in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally we have relatively little experience operating in these or future market segments and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 as the international ecommerce channel grows competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

in 2004 we acquired joyocom limited which is organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and through a people’s republic of china “prc” entity provides technology and services for the joyo amazon websites at wwwjoyocn and wwwamazoncn  the prc regulates joyo amazon’s business through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media products in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyo amazon’s business is operated by prc companies owned by nominee shareholders who are prc nationals although we believe joyo amazon’s structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyo amazon including its subsidiary and affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyo amazon were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not successfully operate our fulfillment centers it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand because it is difficult to predict demand we may not manage our facilities in an optimal way which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing fulfillment and distribution capacity a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our 

  

commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce services to other businesses such as through our marketplace programs amazon enterprise solutions website by amazon and fulfillment by amazon program initiatives as well as other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our commercial agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as they expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 

  

  

  

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 finally as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased 

in addition our 6875 premium adjustable convertible securities due 2010 “6875 peacs” are denominated in euros and increases in the euro relative to the us dollar increase the us dollar amount we owe as interest and principal on the 6875 peacs we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros british pounds and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

  

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales 

customer access to our websites and the speed with which a customer navigates and makes purchases on our websites affect our net sales operating results and the attractiveness of our products and services we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which would make our product and service offerings less attractive our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we have significant indebtedness 

we have significant debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future a significant portion of our future cash flow from operating activities may be dedicated to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on our indebtedness there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments or if we fail to comply with our debt covenants we will be in default in addition we may not be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions or other purposes in the future as needed to plan for or react to changes in technology and in our business and competition and to react in the event of an economic downturn 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely effect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we must accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties the ready availability of damages royalties and the potential for injunctive relief has increased the costs associated with the litigation and settlement of patent infringement claims especially those asserted by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or online services these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 

we do not collect sales or other taxes on shipments of most of our goods into most states in the us under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record and we are obligated to collect sales tax in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional agreements requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of them along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on outofjurisdiction ecommerce companies a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

currently us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives were successful we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors and decrease our future sales 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our worldwide provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and 

  

such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our vendor relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant vendors that are important to our sourcing manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms we may be unable to procure from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue and generate high margins if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business 

  

we could be liable for breaches of security on our websites 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through amazon enterprise solutions and certain other programs from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our customerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by marketplace sellers generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers we also offer services such as amazon web services amazon enterprise solutions cobranded credit cards fulfillment and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1 per share free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives which generally require us to hire additional software engineers computer scientists and merchandisers to increase product sales we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery times increasing selection increasing product categories expanding product information improving ease of use and earning customer trust we generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages 

we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees in managing shareholder dilution we include all stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures consisting of vested and unvested awards and inthemoney 

  

 

   

and outofthemoney stock options total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 435 million and 436 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 these amounts exclude 14 million shares issuable upon conversion of our longterm debt in 2007 we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock under a repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 

we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and most aspects of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure build enhance and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 13 13 and 14 for 2007 2006 and 2005 inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix and our continuing focus on instock inventory availability we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 57 53 and 54 for 2007 2006 and 2005 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by other sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 

our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists software engineers and employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying merchandising selection and systems support we will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved customer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the customer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives amazon web services provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be 

  

 

     

higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

critical accounting judgments 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured additionally revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 

we evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned 

product sales and shipping revenues net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the 

  

carrier return allowances which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns are estimated using historical experience revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales taxes amounts paid in advance for subscription services including amounts received for amazon prime and other membership programs are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term for our products with multiple elements where a standalone value for each element cannot be established we recognize the revenue and related cost over the estimated economic life of the product 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction while inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “net sales” 

commissions and perunit fees received from sellers and similar amounts earned through amazon enterprise solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured when we are responsible for fulfillmentrelated services commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer we record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category based on this evaluation we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value 

we provide fulfillmentrelated services in connection with certain of our agreements in those arrangements as well as other product sales by other sellers the seller maintains ownership of the related products as such these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 

internaluse software and website development 

included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internaluse software and website development including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business as required by statement of position sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internaluse software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internaluse software are expensed as incurred 

currency effect on intercompany balances 

gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions are included in net income 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined 

  

based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock since we primarily issue restricted stock units to our employees the complexity of valuation issues for stock compensation is greatly reduced the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than a straightline method for recognizing compensation expense under this method over 50 of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term the accelerated method also adds a level of complexity in estimating forfeitures if forfeited early in the life of an award the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audit the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered the majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards that related to differences in stockbased compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns 

statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 we allocate our valuation allowance to current and longterm deferred tax assets on a prorata basis 

if we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stockbased compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the fasb may delay a portion of this standard 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value sfas no 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 159 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 r business combinations  and sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas no 141 r requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired sfas no 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent sfas no 141 r and sfas no 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is prohibited we have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements if any upon adoption of sfas no 141 r or sfas no 160 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows 

 

 free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 118 billion for 2007 compared to 486 million and 529 million for 2006 and 2005 see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the increase in free cash flow in 2007 primarily resulted from the increased growth rate of our revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses the decrease in free cash flow in 2006 was primarily driven by our increased expenditure in technology and content and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation deductions now classified as financing cash flows free cash flow for 2005 included the effect of our payment of a 40 million patent litigation settlement operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 31 billion 20 billion and 20 billion at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 amounts held in foreign currencies were 12 billion 623 million and 

  

905 million at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

cash provided by operating activities was 14 billion 702 million and 733 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers from sellers and from nonretail activities such as our cobranded credit card agreements amazon enterprise solutions and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized pursuant to sop 981 that are reflected as cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm debt obligations cash received from customers sellers developers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly 

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash outlays for acquisitions and intellectual property rights and purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development costs cash provided by used in investing activities was 42 million 333 million and 778 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 with the variability caused primarily by purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities capital expenditures were 224 million 216 million and 204 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure fulfillmentrelated assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites capital expenditures included 108 million 108 million and 79 million for internaluse software and website development during 2007 2006 and 2005 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows we made payments for the acquisition of certain companies and intellectual property rights resulting in cash payments net of acquired cash of 75 million 32 million and 24 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 attributable to cash provided by investing activities 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 50 million 400 million and 193 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock repayments of longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations we repurchased 6 million shares of common stock for 248 million in 2007 and 8 million shares of common stock for 252 million in 2006 under a 500 million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in 2006 repayments on longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations were 74 million 383 million and 270 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 repayments on longterm debt include €250 million and €200 million of our 6875 peacs for 300 million and 265 million in 2006 and 2005 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt” cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and exercises of employee stock options sfas no 123r accounting for stock based compensation  requires tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions be presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 257 million 102 million and 7 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were 91 million 35 million and 59 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 we expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stockbased awards 

in 2007 2006 and 2005 we recorded net tax provisions of 184 million 187 million and 95 million a majority of this provision is noncash we have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as such cash taxes paid were 24 million 15 million and 12 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

in february 2008 our board of directors authorized a debt repurchase program replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase through open 

  

market repurchases or private transactions redeem or otherwise retire up to all of our outstanding 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2009 “475 convertible subordinated notes” and 6875 peacs the outstanding principal of our 475 convertible subordinated notes as of this authorization was 899 million and the outstanding principal amount of our 6875 peacs was €240 million in august 2006 our board of directors authorized a 24month program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock pursuant to which we repurchased 252 million and 248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007 respectively in april 2007 our board authorized a new 24month program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock which was replaced in february 2008 by a 24month program to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock 

since our 6875 peacs which are due in 2010 are denominated in euros our us dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the euro to us dollar exchange rate as a result any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and to the extent we make principal payments the amount of us dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement additionally since our interest payable on our 6875 peacs is due in euros the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment gains or losses on the remeasurement of our eurodenominated interest payable are classified as “other income expense net” on our consolidated statements of operations 

on average our high inventory velocity means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 13 13 and 14 for 2007 2006 and 2005 inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix and our continuing focus on instock inventory availability which enables faster delivery of products to our customers we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 

the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december 31 2007 

 

  

    

   in january 2008 we closed or entered into agreements subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions to acquire or invest in certain companies these acquisitions and investments result in aggregate cash payments of approximately 400 million net of cash acquired 

pledged securities 

we are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash and marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit guarantees debt and real estate leases we classify cash and marketable securities with use restrictions of twelve months or longer as noncurrent “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets the balance of pledged securities at december 31 2007 consisted of 14 million in “cash and cash equivalents” and “marketable securities” and 197 million in “other assets” the amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases based on our credit rating and changes in our market capitalization common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows 

 

  

  we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales and gross profit 

net sales information is as follows 

 

 revenue increased 39 in 2007 reflecting revenue growth in both our north america and international segments additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by 399 million for 2007 for a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

the north america revenue growth rate was 38 in 2007 this revenue growth primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings 

the international revenue growth rate was 39 in 2007 this revenue growth reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise increased instock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively affected international net sales by 390 million in 2007 

we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales additionally as we continue to offer increased selection lower prices and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase see “supplemental information” below 

  

gross profit information is as follows 

 

 the increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 corresponds with increases in sales offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and amazon prime generally our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including our product service and geographic mix of sales sales volumes by marketplace sellers changes in vendor pricing including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances lowering prices for customers including from competitive pricing decisions improvements in product sourcing and inventory management and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and amazon prime offers such free shipping and amazon prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales we view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 28 of unit sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller  

gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “effect of exchange rates” below 

north america segment gross margins in 2007 decreased by 90 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics 

north america segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 92 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix as revenue in our retail business grew faster than revenue from marketplace sellers in addition sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media and we continued our efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime 

international segment gross margins in 2007 increased by 38 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by marketplace sellers offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics 

international segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 120 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix as sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media 

  

supplemental information 

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

 

  

  we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products as well as through membership in amazon prime to the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate including memberships in amazon prime our net cost of shipping will increase we seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies 

  

supplemental information about our net sales is as follows 

 

  

   

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

 

 operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

fulfillment 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2007 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels our mix of product sales payment processing and related transaction costs including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain marketplace seller transactions and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales our sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

we expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2007 2006 and 2005 through gains in efficiencies and increases in leased warehouse space this expansion is designed to accommodate greater selection and instock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email campaigns and other initiatives 

  

our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect 

marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search and other variable marketing initiatives 

while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping offers and amazon prime as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

we continue to invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services and digital initiatives as well as expansion of new and existing product categories we are also investing in technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services see “overview” above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation the growth rate of our technology and content spending decreased in 2007 compared to the prior year we intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure 

for the years ended 2007 2006 and 2005 we capitalized 129 million 123 million and 90 million of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 116 million 86 million and 50 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 

a significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us and most of them are allocated to our north america segment 

general and administrative 

the increase in spending in general and administrative in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees 

stockbased compensation 

as of january 1 2005 we adopted sfas no 123r which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 

the adoption of sfas no 123r resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of 26 million in 2005 which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 

stockbased compensation was 185 million 101 million and 87 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 the increase in stockbased compensation is primarily attributable to an increase in total stock compensation value granted to our employees 

  

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net was 9 million and 10 million during 2007 and 2006 primarily attributable to amortization of other intangibles other operating expense net was 47 million in 2005 primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for 40 million as well as amortization of other intangibles of 5 million 

income from operations 

income from operations was 655 million 389 million and 432 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 the increase in 2007 from 2006 is primarily a result of the increased growth rate of our revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses the decrease in 2006 from 2005 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content 

interest expense and income 

the primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our longterm debt instruments including a 899 million principal balance of our 475 convertible subordinated notes and a €240 million 350 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2007 principal balance of our 6875 peacs at december 31 2007 interest expense was 77 million 78 million and 92 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of 300 million and 265 million in 2006 and 2005 

our total longterm indebtedness was 13 billion at both december 31 2007 and 2006 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt” 

our interest income was 90 million 59 million and 44 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market mutual funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 1 million 4 million and 2 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 and consisted primarily of gains and losses on sales of marketable securities foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous losses 

foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6875 peacs as well as foreigncurrency gains and losses on crosscurrency investments since interest payments on our 6875 peacs are settled in euros the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and euro between reporting dates and payment 

remeasurements and other 

remeasurements and other consisted of the following 

 

  

   

 income taxes 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 184 million 187 million and 95 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 the effective tax rate in 2007 was lower than the 35 us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the us the effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35 us federal statutory rate resulting from establishment of our european headquarters in luxembourg which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time associated with the establishment of our european headquarters we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the us to international locations these transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions 

included in the 2005 provision and reducing the impact of the international restructure is a tax benefit of 90 million resulting from certain of our deferred tax assets becoming more likely than not realizable this tax benefit represented 022 and 021 of basic and diluted earnings per share 

we expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 30 however our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including from accurately predicting our taxable income the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates and business acquisitions and investments we have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income as such we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be noncash 

effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data 

 

  

    

  nongaap financial measures 

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measure of “free cash flow” meets the definition of a nongaap financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations in limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations however since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by operating activities” for 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions 

 

 in addition we provide operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation we provide this information to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in 

  

the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “technology and content” “marketing” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher we compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stockbased awards in the footnotes to our financial statements stockbased compensation programs are an important element of our compensation structure and all forms of stockbased awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations

 these projections are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments 

information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market mutual funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

  

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2007 in millions except percentages 

 

 at december 31 2007 we had longterm debt of 13 billion primarily associated with our 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs which are due in 2009 and 2010 the fair value of our longterm debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

  

based upon quoted market prices the fair value of the 475 convertible subordinated notes was 11 billion at december 31 2007 outstanding principal of 899 million and 883 million outstanding principal of 900 million at december 31 2006 the fair value of the 6875 peacs was 358 million at december 31 2007 outstanding principal of €240 million and 320 million at december 31 2006 outstanding principal of €240 million 

foreign exchange risk 

during 2007 net sales from our international segment accounted for 45 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2007 international segment revenues increased 390 million in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2007 of 12 billion an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 60 million 120 million and 240 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” as defined by sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency based on the net intercompany balances at december 31 2007 of 250 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 strengthening of the us dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of 15 million 25 million and 50 million recorded to “remeasurements and other” 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our 6875 peacs which have an outstanding principal balance at december 31 2007 of €240 million 350 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2007 due to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio which we cannot predict our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6875 peacs since issuance in february 2000 has increased by 114 million as of december 31 2007 based on the outstanding 6875 peacs’ principal balance an assumed 5 10 and 20 weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro would result in additional losses of approximately 20 million 35 million and 70 million recorded to “remeasurements and other” additionally we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6875 peacs to protect against exchange rate fluctuations assuming the us dollar weakens against the euro by 5 10 and 20 in 2007 we would incur 1 million 2 million and 5 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange 

see “effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2007 our recorded basis in equity securities including both publiclytraded and private companies was 29 million including 12 million classified as “marketable securities” and 17 million classified as “other assets” we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are otherthantemporary the fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general companyspecific circumstances and changes in general economic conditions based on the fair value of the publiclytraded equity securities we held at december 31 2007 of 55 million recorded basis of 12 million an assumed 15 30 and 50 adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately 10 million 15 million and 25 million

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion amazoncom inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the coso criteria

 item 1a risk factors 

please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition these risks are not the only ones we face 

we face intense competition 

our market segments are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing 

competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders ecommerce inherently more competitive than other retail increased competition may reduce our sales and profits 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal and competitive risks 

we do not expect to benefit in our newer market segments whether products services technologies or geographic areas from any firsttomarket advantages we may have limited or no experience in these new activities and our customers may not adopt them our newer service offerings including merchant services digital and web services may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures in addition our gross profits in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer 

  

activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results 

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate 

we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates of net sales a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our net sales are less than expected 

our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our thirdparty sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in consumer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth 

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally we have relatively little experience operating in these or future market segments and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain 

  

international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as the international ecommerce channel grows competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth 

in 2004 we acquired joyocom which is organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and operates wwwjoyocom and wwwjoyocomcn in the people’s republic of china “prc” in cooperation with a prc subsidiary and prc affiliates the prc regulates joyocom’s business through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media products in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyocom’s business is operated through a prc subsidiary which acts in cooperation with prc companies owned by nominee shareholders who are prc nationals although we believe joyocom’s structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyocom or its subsidiary or affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to 

  

fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyocom were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business in addition joyocom is subject to many of the risks described in “our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments” 

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

if we do not successfully operate our fulfillment centers it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand because it is difficult to predict demand we may not manage our facilities in an optimal way which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing fulfillment and distribution capacity a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our international websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory 

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash 

  

equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december 31 our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

we provide ecommerce services to other businesses such as through our merchants amazon enterprise solutions website by amazon and fulfillment by amazon program initiatives as well as other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services enable third parties to offer products or services through our websites and power thirdparty websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales therefore if the other company’s offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services 

as our commercial agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as they expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

our present and future thirdparty services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

 

  

  

  

 our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 finally as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

we have foreign exchange risk 

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased 

in addition our 6875 peacs are denominated in euros and increases in the euro relative to the us dollar increase the us dollar amount we owe as interest and principal on the 6875 peacs we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros british pounds and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

our investments and the consideration we receive under certain commercial agreements may subject us to a number of risks 

we have entered into and may in the future enter into commercial agreements whereby we perform certain services in exchange for cash equity securities of these companies andor additional benefits such as website traffic our compensation may be dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales in some cases we have also made separate cash investments in the other company to the extent we have received equity securities as compensation fluctuations in the value of such securities will affect our realization of amounts we have received as compensation for services 

in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce our cash proceeds shorten the term of the agreements or both we may in the future enter into further amendments of our commercial agreements although these amendments did not affect the amount of unearned revenue previously recorded by us if any the timing of revenue recognition of these recorded unearned amounts was changed to correspond with the terms of the amended agreements to the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable as amounts are subsequently received such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement 

  

our investments in equity securities are included in “marketable securities” and “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets we may conclude in future quarters that the fair values of our investments have experienced additional otherthantemporary declines and reduce the carrying value of the securities and record a loss 

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales 

customer access to our websites and the speed with which a customer navigates and makes purchases on our websites affects our net sales operating results and the attractiveness of our products and services we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing other services which would make our product and service offerings less attractive our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

we have significant indebtedness 

we have significant longterm debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future a significant portion of our future cash flow from operating activities is likely to remain dedicated to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on our indebtedness there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments or if we fail to comply with our debt covenants we will be in default in addition we may not be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions or other purposes in the future as needed to plan for or react to changes in technology and in our business and competition and to react in the event of an economic downturn 

we face significant inventory risk 

in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely effect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we must accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products and companies that have relationships with us in which they identify and buy inventory as well as bear the risk of obsolescence must do the same demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product 

  

selection and accurately forecast product demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or inventory from certain sources may require significant leadtime and prepayment and such inventory may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties the ready availability of damages royalties and the potential for injunctive relief has increased the costs associated with the litigation and settlement of patent infringement claims especially those asserted by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements 

our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service 

we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile 

we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a as well as 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or online services these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online markets including certain aspects of amazon marketplace unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 

we do not collect sales or other taxes on shipments of most of our goods into most states in the us under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record and we are obligated to collect sales tax in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional agreements requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of them along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on outofjurisdiction ecommerce companies a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

currently us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives were successful we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors and decrease our future sales 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our worldwide provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of 

  

business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our vendor relationships subject us to a number of risks 

we have significant vendors that are important to our sourcing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee availability of merchandise or content particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise or content to us on acceptable terms we may not be able to acquire merchandise or content from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

some of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and thirdparty sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

we are subject to a number of risks related to payments we accept 

we accept payments by a variety of methods including credit card debit card gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected finally we offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue and generate high margins if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

we could be liable for breaches of security on our websites 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under merchants 

  

marketplace and certain other of our programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our third party sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results in addition the functionality of our payments program depends on certain thirdparty vendors delivering services if these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services our payments program and our businesses that use it may not be viable finally we may be unable to prevent sellers in our merchants marketplace amazon enterprise solutions and certain other programs from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

overview 

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our websites include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third parties generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties we also offer services such as amazon enterprise solutions cobranded credit cards web services fulfillment and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers 

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1 per share free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives which generally requires us to hire additional software engineers computer scientists and merchandisers to increase product sales we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery times increasing selection increasing product categories expanding product information improving ease of use and earning customer trust we generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages because we have deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards the free cash flow impact from income taxes paid is currently less than our income tax provision 

we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they better align 

  

   

the interests of our shareholders and employees restricted stock units result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded on an accelerated basis over the underlying service periods net of estimated cancellations total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 436 million and 438 million at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 these totals include all stock awards outstanding without regard for estimated forfeitures consisting of vested and unvested awards and inthemoney and outofthemoney stock options in 2006 we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock under a repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 

we seek to reduce our customer experience variable costs per unit and work to leverage our customer experience fixed costs our customer experience variable costs include product costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and most aspects of our marketing costs our customer experience fixed costs include the costs necessary to build enhance and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 13 14 and 16 for 2006 2005 and 2004 inventory turnover has declined over the last several years primarily due to changes in product mix and our continuing focus on instock inventory availability we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix our mix of thirdparty sales our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 53 54 and 53 for 2006 2005 and 2004 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of thirdparty sales the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms 

our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists software engineers and employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying merchandising selection and systems support we will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services digital initiatives and category expansion as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to 

  

     

currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

in addition the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured additionally revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 

we evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned 

product sales and shipping revenues net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail items sold to customers are made 

  

pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier return allowances which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns are estimated using historical experience amounts paid in advance for subscription services including amounts received for amazon prime online dvd rentals and other membership programs are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction while inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “net sales” 

commissions and perunit fees received from thirdparty sellers and similar amounts earned through amazon enterprise solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the thirdparty seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured when we are responsible for fulfillmentrelated services commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer we record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience 

inventories 

inventories consisting of products available for sale are accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category based on this evaluation we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value 

we provide fulfillmentrelated services in connection with certain of our agreements in those arrangements as well as other product sales by third parties the thirdparty maintains ownership of the related products as such these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 

internaluse software 

included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internaluse software and website development including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business as required by statement of position sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internaluse software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internaluse software are expensed as incurred 

currency effect on intercompany balances 

gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions are included in net income our international operations are financed in part by the us parent company 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined 

  

based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model since we primarily issue restricted stock units to our employees the complexity of valuation issues for stock compensation is greatly reduced the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 

we utilize the accelerated method rather than a straightline method for recognizing compensation expense under this method over 50 of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term the accelerated method also adds a level of complexity in estimating forfeitures if employees leave early in the life of an award the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audit the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered the majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards that related to differences in stockbased compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns 

statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 we allocate our valuation allowance to current and longterm deferred tax assets on a prorata basis 

if we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stockbased compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax 

  

position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2007 we estimate the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow information is as follows 

 

 our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow a nongaap financial measure was 486 million for 2006 compared to 529 million and 477 million for 2005 and 2004 see “results of operations—nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the decrease in free cash flow in 2006 was primarily driven by our increased expenditure in technology and content and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation now classified as financing cash flows free cash flow for 2005 included the effect of our payment of a 40 million patent litigation settlement operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and timing of capital expenditures working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 20 billion at december 31 2006 and 2005 amounts held in foreign currencies were 623 million and 905 million at the end of 2006 and 2005 and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen 

prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stockbased compensation was presented in operating cash flows sfas no 123r requires benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions be presented as financing cash flows which is effectively a reclassification between operating and financing cash flows tax benefits resulting from stockbased compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were 102 million 7 million and 8 million for december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 with the amounts for 2006 and 2005 treated as financing cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 702 million 733 million and 566 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the 40 million patent litigation settlement in 2005 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers from thirdparty sellers and from nonretail activities such as through our cobranded credit card agreements amazon enterprise solutions and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized pursuant to sop 981 that are reflected in cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm debt obligations cash received from customers thirdparty sellers and nonretail activities generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly 

cash used in investing activities corresponds with purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash flows from acquisitions and purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website 

  

development costs cash used in investing activities was 333 million 778 million and 317 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 with the variability caused primarily by purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities capital expenditures were 216 million 204 million and 89 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites as well as investments in fulfillmentrelated assets and technology infrastructure capital expenditures included 108 million 79 million and 44 million for internaluse software and website development during 2006 2005 and 2004 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows we also made payments net of acquired cash of 32 million 24 million and 71 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 to purchase certain comapnies 

cash used in financing activities was 400 million 193 million and 97 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock repayments of longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations we repurchased 252 million of our common stock under a 500 million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in 2006 repayments on longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations were 383 million 270 million and 157 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 repayments on longterm debt include €250 million and €200 million of our 6875 peacs for 300 million and 265 million in 2006 and 2005 additionally we repaid 154 million to redeem a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes in 2004 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt” if all of our capital leases were classified as operating leases the detriment to cash flows from operating activities would have been 21 million 2 million and 4 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were 35 million 59 million and 60 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were 102 million and 7 million in 2006 and 2005 in accordance with adoption of sfas no 123r we expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will continue to decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stockbased awards 

in 2006 and 2005 we recorded net tax provisions of 187 million and 95 million and in 2004 we recorded a net tax benefit of 233 million a majority of this provision and benefit is noncash we have net operating losses that are classified as deferred tax assets and are being utilized to reduce our taxable income to nominal levels as such cash taxes paid were 15 million 12 million and 4 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis 

in 2006 our board of directors authorized a debt repurchase program replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase through open market repurchases or private transactions redeem or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of 500 million of our outstanding 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs additionally in august 2006 our board of directors authorized a 24month program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 500 million of our common stock of which 248 million remains authorized for repurchase at december 31 2006 

since our 6875 peacs which are due in 2010 are denominated in euros our us dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the euro to us dollar exchange rate as a result any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and to the extent we make principal payments the amount of us dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement additionally since our interest payable on our 6875 peacs is due in euros the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment gains or losses on the remeasurement of our eurodenominated interest payable are classified as “other income expense net” on our consolidated statements of operations 

on average our high inventory velocity means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was 13 14 and 16 for 2006 2005 and 2004 we expect some variability 

  

in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including our product mix our mix of thirdparty sales and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers among other factors the decline in inventory turnover is primarily attributed to our emphasis on category expansion and maintaining wide selection of instock inventory which enables faster delivery of products to our customers 

the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december 31 2006 

 

   pledged securities 

we are required to support certain letters of credit debt and real estate leases by pledging or otherwise restricting cash and marketable securities we classify marketable securities where a use restriction exists for a period of twelve months or longer as noncurrent “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets the balance of pledged securities at december 31 2006 consisted of 50 million in “marketable securities” and 86 million in “other assets” the amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases with fluctuations in our market capitalization common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock and based on our creditrating information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows 

 

    we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash 

  

needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1a of part i “risk factors” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities from lenders repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

results of operations 

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

net sales and gross profit 

net sales information is as follows 

 

 revenue increased 26 in 2006 reflecting revenue growth in both our north america and international segments additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by 24 million for 2006 for a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rate changes see “effect of exchange rates” below 

the north america revenue growth rate was 25 in 2006 this revenue growth primarily reflects increased unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime shift in mix of product sales from media to electronics and other general merchandise increased instock product availability and increased selection of product offerings in our existing categories 

  

the international revenue growth rate was 28 in 2006 this revenue growth reflects increased unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers shift in mix of product sales from media to electronics and other general merchandise increased instock product availability and increased selection of product offerings in our existing categories additionally changes in currency exchange rates positively affected international net sales by 18 million in 2006 

we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales additionally as we continue to offer increased selection lower prices and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase see “supplemental information” below 

gross profit information is as follows 

 

 the increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 corresponds with increases in sales offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and amazon prime generally our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including our product service and geographic mix of sales sales volumes by thirdparty sellers changes in vendor pricing including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances lowering prices for customers including from competitive pricing decisions improvements in product sourcing and inventory management and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and amazon prime offers such free shipping and amazon prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales we offer promotions such as free membership trials for amazon prime and we expect to continue to offer these promotions in the future we view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

sales of products by thirdparty sellers on our websites represented 28 28 and 26 of unit sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by a third party 

gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “effect of exchange rates” below 

north america segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 92 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix revenue in our retail business grew faster than revenue from thirdparty sellers resulting in lower gross margins sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media further reducing gross margins additionally we continued our efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime 

  

north america segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 30 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increases in revenue by thirdparty sellers increases in amounts earned from our cobranded credit card agreement improvements in terms with suppliers and increases in amounts earned from service agreements offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers including from our free shipping offers and amazon prime 

international segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 120 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media resulting in lower gross margins 

international segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 162 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increasing revenue from thirdparty sellers and increases in discounts we receive from our product suppliers offset partially by changes in mix of product sales and our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers including from our free shipping offers 

supplemental information 

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

 

   we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products as well as through membership in amazon prime to the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate including memberships in amazon prime our net cost of shipping will increase our net shipping cost results primarily from our free shipping offers and amazon prime we seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies 

  

supplemental information about our net sales is as follows 

 

    

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is as follows in millions 

 

 operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see “nongaap financial measures” and item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

fulfillment 

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2006 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels our mix of product sales payment processing and related transaction costs including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain thirdparty seller transactions and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity 

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs including those from our guarantee for certain thirdparty seller transactions our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing costs associated with thirdparty seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales our thirdparty sales have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

we expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2006 and 2005 through gains in efficiencies as well as increases in leased warehouse space this expansion is designed to accommodate greater selection and instock levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment 

marketing 

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email campaigns and other initiatives 

  

our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect 

marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search and other variable marketing initiatives 

while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping offers and amazon prime as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

technology and content 

in 2005 and 2006 we added computer scientists software engineers and employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying merchandising and systems support we will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms web services and digital initiatives as well as expansion of new and existing product categories additionally we increased spending on technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency we believe these initiatives are important to our longterm success see “overview” above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation we intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add employees to our staff 

for the years ended 2006 2005 and 2004 we capitalized 123 million 90 million and 44 million of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was 86 million 50 million and 30 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 

a significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us and most of them are allocated to our north america segment 

general and administrative 

the increase in spending in general and administrative in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees in 2005 we recorded a 12 million credit for actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs previously incurred by us 

stockbased compensation 

prior to january 1 2005 we accounted for stockbased awards under the intrinsic value method which followed the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations the intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units at their estimated fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and for stock options to the extent option exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant also to the extent stock awards were subject to an exchange offer other modifications or performance criteria such awards were subject to variable accounting treatment to the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

as of january 1 2005 we adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our 

  

common stock and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 123 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method under sfas no 123r the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates additionally because we implemented sfas no 123r we no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment 

the adoption of sfas no 123r resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of 26 million in 2005 which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 

stockbased compensation was 101 million 87 million and 58 million during 2006 2005 and 2004 we applied the fair value accounting provisions of sfas no 123r for 2006 and 2005 compared with the application of apb opinion no 25 including variable accounting treatment on certain awards for 2004 because of the application of different methods of accounting as well as the effects of variable accounting treatment in 2004 stockbased compensation for 2006 and 2005 is not comparable to prior periods as of december 31 2006 there was 217 million of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stockbased compensation arrangements 

other operating expense income 

other operating expense was 10 million in 2006 primarily attributable to amortization of other intangibles other operating expense was 47 million in 2005 primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for 40 million as well as amortization of other intangibles of 5 million other operating income was 8 million for 2004 which includes net restructuringrelated credits of 9 million and amortization of other intangibles of 1 million 

during 2004 we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring was necessary for our future needs we reduced our restructuringrelated liability resulting in a gain of 13 million for 2004 lease payments for this office space are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations 

in 2004 we streamlined our organizational structure in france to reduce our operating costs this reduction resulted in severance costs of 4 million classified in “other operating expense income” on our consolidated statements of operations 

income from operations 

income from operations was 389 million 432 million and 440 million during 2006 2005 and 2004 the decrease in 2006 from 2005 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content the decrease in 2005 from 2004 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content an increase in stockbased compensation that is now recorded under sfas no 123r fair value accounting and a payment of 40 million to settle a patent lawsuit these increased expenditures were partially offset by higher net sales and gross profit 

interest expense and income 

the primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our longterm debt instruments including a 900 million principal balance of our 475 us convertible subordinated notes and a 

  

€240 million 317 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2006 principal balance of our 6875 peacs at december 31 2006 interest expense was 78 million 92 million and 107 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of 300 million 265 million and 150 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 

at december 31 2006 our total longterm indebtedness was 125 billion compared to 148 billion at december 31 2005 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt” 

our interest income was 59 million 44 million and 28 million during 2006 2005 and 2004 we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market mutual funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 4 million 2 million and 5 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 and consisted primarily of gains and losses on sales of marketable securities foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous losses 

foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6875 peacs as well as foreigncurrency gains and losses on crosscurrency investments since interest payments on our 6875 peacs are settled in euros the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and euro between reporting dates and payment 

remeasurements and other 

remeasurements and other consisted of the following 

 

   income taxes 

we recorded a provision benefit for income taxes of 187 million 95 million and 233 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 the effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35 statutory rate resulting from establishing our european headquarters in luxembourg which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time associated with the establishment of our european headquarters we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the us to international locations these transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions 

  

included in the 2005 provision and reducing the impact of the international restructure is a tax benefit of 90 million resulting from certain of our deferred tax assets becoming more likely than not realizable this tax benefit represented 022 and 021 of basic and diluted earnings per share 

we recorded a tax benefit of 244 million in 2004 representing 060 and 057 of basic and diluted earnings per share and a credit to stockholders’ equity of 106 million as we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable 

we expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 35 or less however our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including from accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates 

effect of exchange rates 

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measure of “free cash flow” meets the definition of a nongaap financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that when viewed 

  

with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations in limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations however since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows 

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by operating activities” for 2006 2005 and 2004 in millions 

 

 in addition we provide operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation we provide this information to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses without stockbased compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the “fulfillment” “technology and content” “marketing” and “general and administrative” line items would be higher we compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stockbased awards in the footnotes to our financial statements stockbased compensation programs are an important element of the company’s compensation structure and all forms of stockbased awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments 

information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market mutual funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

  

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2006 in millions except percentages 

 

 at december 31 2006 we had longterm debt of 125 billion primarily associated with our 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs which are due in 2009 and 2010 the fair value of our longterm debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

based upon quoted market prices the fair value of the 475 convertible subordinated notes outstanding principal of 900 million was 883 million and 868 million at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 

  

the fair value of the 6875 peacs was 320 million at december 31 2006 outstanding principal of €240 million and 586 million at december 31 2005 outstanding principal of €490 million 

foreign exchange risk 

during 2006 net sales from our international segment consisting of wwwamazoncouk  wwwamazonde  wwwamazonfr  wwwamazoncojp  and wwwjoyocom  accounted for 45 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from these websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros british pounds and japanese yen the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2006 international segment revenues increased 18 million in comparison with the prior year 

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2006 of 623 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 30 million 60 million and 125 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” as defined by sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency based on the net intercompany balances at december 31 2006 of 386 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 strengthening of the us dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of 20 million 40 million and 80 million recorded to “remeasurements and other” 

we have foreign exchange risk related to our 6875 peacs which have an outstanding principal balance at december 31 2006 of €240 million 317 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2006 due to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio which we cannot predict our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6875 peacs since issuance in february 2000 has increased by 80 million as of december 31 2006 based on the outstanding 6875 peacs’ principal balance an assumed 5 10 and 20 weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro would result in additional losses of approximately 15 million 30 million and 65 million recorded to “remeasurements and other” additionally we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6875 peacs to protect against exchange rate fluctuations assuming the us dollar weakens against the euro by 5 10 and 20 in 2006 we would incur 1 million 2 million and 4 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange 

see “effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2006 our recorded basis in equity securities including both publiclytraded and private companies was 27 million including 7 million classified as “marketable securities” and 19 million classified as “other assets” we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are otherthantemporary the fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general companyspecific circumstances and changes in general economic conditions based on the fair value of the publiclytraded equity securities we held at december 31 2006 of 59 million recorded basis of 11 million an assumed 15 30 and 50 adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately 10 million 20 million and 30 million

the board of directors and stockholders 

amazoncom inc 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that amazoncom inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria amazoncom inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that amazoncom inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion amazoncom inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the coso criteria

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  

we face intense competition 

  

the market segments in which we compete are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including both the retail and ecommerce services industries 

  

many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we have they may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies competitors in both the retail and ecommerce services industries also may be able to devote more resources to technology development fulfillment and marketing than we do 

  

competition in the ecommerce channel may intensify other companies in the retail and ecommerce service industries may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions as various internet market segments obtain large loyal customer bases participants in those segments may expand into the market segments in which we operate in addition new and expanded web technologies including search web services and digital may further intensify the competitive nature of online retail and ecommerce services the nature of the internet as an electronic marketplace facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders it inherently more competitive than conventional retailing formats this increased competition may reduce our sales operating profits or both 

  

our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources 

  

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our operations both domestically and internationally and will continue to expand further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings and customer base such expansion increases the complexity of our business and places a significant strain on our management operations technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage it effectively our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth negatively affect our operating results and harm our business 

  

our expansion into new product areas and geographic regions subjects us to business and competitive risks 

  

we do not expect to benefit in our newer market segments whether products services or new geographic areas from the firsttomarket advantage that we experienced in the us online book channel our gross profits in our newer business activities may be lower than in our older business activities in addition we may have limited or no experience in new product and service activities and new geographic areas and our customers may not favorably receive our new businesses our newer market segments may present special technology challenges that we have not faced before to the extent we pursue commercial agreements acquisitions andor strategic alliances to facilitate new product or service activities or geographic expansion the agreements acquisitions andor alliances may not be successful if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth negatively affect our operating results and harm our business 

  

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth 

  

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future net sales and rate of growth a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our net sales fall short of our expectations 

  

our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions throughout the world a softening of demand whether caused by changes in consumer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth terrorist attacks and armed hostilities create economic and consumer uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue or growth such events could create delays in and increase the cost of product shipments which may decrease demand revenue growth may not be sustainable and our companywide percentage growth rate may decrease in the future 

  

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

finally both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality are likely to affect our business internet usage generally slows during the summer months and sales in almost all of our product groups particularly toys and electronics usually increase significantly in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 

  

we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

  

our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan over time to continue to expand our reach in international market segments we have relatively little experience in purchasing marketing and distributing products or services for these or future market segments and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages it is costly to establish international facilities and operations promote our brand internationally and develop localized websites stores and other systems we may not succeed in these efforts our net sales from international market segments may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining the related operations and therefore these operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

  

our international sales and related operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling abroad including but not limited to risks with respect to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as the international ecommerce channel continues to grow competition will likely intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand name recognition in addition governments in foreign jurisdictions may regulate ecommerce or other online services in such areas as licenses content privacy network security copyright encryption taxation or distribution we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth in international market segments 

  

in 2004 we acquired joyocom which is organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and operates wwwjoyocom and wwwjoyocomcn in the people’s republic of china “prc” in cooperation with a prc subsidiary and prc affiliates the prc regulates joyocom’s business through regulations and license requirements restricting i the scope of foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of certain media products in order to meet the prc local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyocom’s business is operated through a prc subsidiary which acts in cooperation with prc companies owned by nominee shareholders who are prc nationals although we believe joyocom’s structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyocom or its subsidiary or affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyocom were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management 

  

and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business in addition joyocom is subject to many of the risks described in “our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments” 

  

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

  

if we do not successfully operate our fulfillment centers it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand because it is difficult to predict demand we may not manage our facilities in an optimal way which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing fulfillment and distribution capacity a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring us to make longzone shipments or partial shipments from one or more locations orders from several of our internationallyfocused websites are fulfilled primarily from a single fulfillment center and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

  

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to our fulfillment centers and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

  

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies in our fulfillment centers thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory in and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability or failure of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

  

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

  

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to be realized during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year if we do not stock popular products in sufficient amounts or fail to have sources to timely restock popular products such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make longzone shipments or partial shipments from one or more locations orders from several of our internationallyfocused websites are fulfilled primarily from a single fulfillment center and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery especially for the holiday season if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday or other demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers during these peak periods and third parties that provide fulfillment services to our customers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand finally we along with our customer service cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff customer service centers 

  

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable our accounts payable balance should decline during the first three months following yearend which will result in a decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

  

we may enter into commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships with other companies we have entered into agreements to provide ecommerce services to other businesses and we plan to enter into similar agreements in the future including as part of our merchants syndicated stores and amazon enterprise solutions program initiatives under such agreements we may perform services such as providing our technology services such as search browse and personalization permitting other businesses and individuals to offer products or services through our websites and powering thirdparty websites either with or without providing accompanying fulfillment services these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may constrain the number of such agreements we are able to enter into and may affect our ability to integrate and deliver services under the relevant agreements if we fail to implement maintain and develop successfully the various components of such commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of thirdparty software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of sales that the other company makes therefore if the other business’s website or product or services offering is not successful we may not receive all of the compensation we are otherwise due under the agreement or may not be able to maintain the agreement moreover we may not be able to succeed in our plans to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms 

  

as our commercial agreements expire or otherwise terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of the agreements or both some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as such agreements expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services in addition several past commercial agreements were with companies that experienced business failures and were unable to meet their obligations to us we may in the future enter into further amendments of our commercial agreements or encounter other parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results as an example we are currently in litigation with toysruscom over our commercial agreement and toysruscom’s parent toysrus inc recently was acquired by a private investment group in the event of the early termination of our commercial agreement with toysruscom we would attempt to replace the product selection currently provided by toysruscom with owned inventory and offerings from other parties but our operating results could be negatively impacted 

  

our present and future thirdparty services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

  

   

   

   

   

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

  

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in such as through joint ventures or other business combinations additional companies acquisitions and investments create risks such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

finally as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

  

we have foreign exchange risk 

  

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has become more pronounced see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—effect of exchange rates” for a table demonstrating the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar 

  

in addition our 6875 peacs are denominated in euros not us dollars we remeasure the principal of the 6875 peacs quarterly based on fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio and record gains or losses in “remeasurements and other” on our consolidated statements of operations as a result increases in the euro relative to the us dollar increase the us dollar amount we owe as interest and principal furthermore we hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities primarily in euros british pounds and yen accordingly if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

  

our investments and the consideration we receive under certain commercial agreements may subject us to a number of risks 

  

in the past we have entered into commercial agreements with other companies including strategic alliances whereby we perform certain ecommerce services and in exchange for our services we received cash equity securities of these companies andor additional benefits such as website traffic the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is dependent on the volume of sales made by the other company in some cases we have also made separate investments in the other company by making a cash payment in exchange for equity securities of that company we may make similar investments in the future to the extent we have received equity securities as compensation fluctuations in the value of such securities will affect our ultimate realization of amounts we have received as compensation for services 

  

in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of our commercial agreements or both we may in the future enter into further amendments of our commercial agreements although these amendments did not affect the amount of unearned revenue previously recorded by us if any the timing of revenue recognition of these recorded unearned amounts was changed to correspond with the terms of the amended agreements to the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable as future amounts are subsequently received such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement 

  

our investments in equity securities are included in “marketable securities” and “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets we regularly review all of our investments in public and private companies for otherthantemporary declines in fair value when we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment below our accounting basis is otherthantemporary we reduce the carrying value of the securities we hold and record a loss in the amount of any such decline in recent years securities of companies in the internet and ecommerce industries have experienced significant difficulties we may conclude in future quarters that the fair values of our investments have experienced additional otherthantemporary declines as of december 31 2005 our recorded basis in equity securities was 14 million including 6 million classified as “marketable securities” and 8 million classified as “other assets” 

  

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

  

we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president chief executive officer and chairman of the board we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

  

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales 

  

customer access to our websites and the speed with which a customer is able to navigate and make purchases on our websites directly affects the volume of goods we sell and the services we offer and thus affects our net sales we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results 

  

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders 

  

should this occur it would make our product offerings less attractive to our customers and our service offerings less attractive to third parties while we do have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

  

we have significant indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had longterm indebtedness of 152 billion we make annual or semiannual interest payments on the indebtedness under our two convertible notes which are due in 2009 and 2010 although we made debt principal reduction payments we may incur substantial additional debt in the future and in any event a significant portion of our future cash flow from operating activities is likely to remain dedicated to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on our indebtedness our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions or other purposes in the future as needed to plan for or react to changes in technology and in our business and competition and to react in the event of an economic downturn 

  

there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments or if we fail to comply with covenants in our indebtedness we will be in default in addition we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt and other” 

  

we face significant inventory risk 

  

we are exposed to significant inventory risks as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products in order to be successful we must accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product selection and accurately forecast product demand a failure to optimize inventory within our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring us to make split shipments from one or more locations complimentary upgrades and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery 

  

as a result of our thirdparty services relationships with toysruscom babiesruscom target and other companies these parties identify buy and bear the financial risk of inventory obsolescence for their corresponding stores and merchandise as a result if any of these parties fail to forecast product demand or optimize or maintain access to inventory we would receive reduced service fees under the agreements and our business and reputation could be harmed 

  

the acquisition of certain types of inventory or inventory from certain sources may require significant leadtime and prepayment and such inventory may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons 

  

any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

  

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers 

  

partners and others to protect our proprietary rights effective trademark service mark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available online 

  

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is inherently difficult and we may not be able to determine the existence or extent of any such unauthorized use in addition third parties that license our proprietary rights may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our patents trademarks domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

  

other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the imposition of damages that we must pay we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements 

  

we have a limited operating history and our stock price is highly volatile 

  

we have a relatively short operating history and a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of these events may cause our stock price to rise or fall and may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities 

  

future volatility in our stock price could force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

  

government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

  

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership sales and other taxes libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business in addition many jurisdictions currently regulate “auctions” and “auctioneers” and may regulate online auction services jurisdictions may also regulate other consumertoconsumer online markets including certain aspects of amazon marketplace this could in turn diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

  

taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 

  

we do not collect sales taxes or other taxes with respect to shipments of most of our goods into most states in the us under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record of the applicable merchandise and we are obligated to collect sales tax in most states in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional strategic alliances requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of those networks along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on outofjurisdiction companies that engage in ecommerce a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

  

currently decisions of the us supreme court restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering various initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives addressed the supreme court’s constitutional concerns and resulted in a reversal of its current position we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors and decrease our future sales 

  

our vendor relationships subject us to a number of risks 

  

although we continue to increase the number of vendors that supply products to us and no vendor accounts for 10 or more of our inventory purchases we have significant vendors that are important to our sourcing we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop 

  

selling merchandise to us on acceptable terms we may not be able to acquire merchandise from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms 

  

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

  

some of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls certain businesses and individuals also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient resources to protect themselves from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our vendor agreements with our distributors manufacturers and thirdparty sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

  

we are subject to a number of risks related to payments we accept 

  

we accept payments by a variety of methods including credit card debit card gift certificates direct debit from a customer’s bank account physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers like direct debit in the us we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment transactions including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected finally we offer cobranded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue and generate high margins if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we could be liable for breaches of security on our website 

  

a fundamental requirement for ecommerce is the secure storage and transmission of confidential information although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

  

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

  

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition we are aware that governmental agencies have investigated the provision of online payment services and could require changes in the way this business is conducted under merchants marketplace and certain other of our programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our third party sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results any costs we incur as a result of liability because of our a2z guarantee or otherwise could harm our business in addition the functionality of our payments program depends on certain thirdparty vendors delivering services if these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services our payments program and our businesses that use it may not be viable finally we may be unable to prevent sellers in our merchants marketplace amazon enterprise solutions and certain other programs from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers 

  

we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards 

  

technology in the ecommerce industry changes rapidly we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and preferences and industry standards competitors often introduce new products and services with new technologies these changes and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing websites and proprietary technology obsolete

none 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

we do not own any real estate as of december 31 2005 we operated the following facilities throughout the world 

  

      

we believe our properties are suitable and adequate for our present needs and we periodically evaluate whether additional facilities are necessary

the company is involved from time to time in claims proceedings and litigation including the following

overview 

  

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers  the products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors publishers and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties we offer services such as amazon enterprise solutions cobranded credit cards and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers 

  

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1  free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists to increase sales we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery times increasing selection expanding product information improving ease of use and earning customer trust we generally focus on gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than margin percentages because we have deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards the free cash flow impact from income taxes paid is less than our income tax provision 

  

we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders’ we moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002 because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods net of estimated cancellations total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 438 million at december 31 2005 compared with 434 million at december 31 2004 and 433 million at december 31 2003 these totals include all stock awards outstanding without regard for estimated forfeitures consisting of vested and unvested awards and inthemoney and outofthemoney stock options 

  

we seek to reduce our customer experience variable costs per unit and work to leverage our customer experience fixed costs our customer experience variable costs include product costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and most aspects of our marketing costs our customer experience fixed costs include the costs necessary to build enhance and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 

  

   

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a negative operating cycle 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 14 16 and 18 for 2005 2004 and 2003 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix our mix of thirdparty sales our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our future investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 54 53 and 50 for 2005 2004 and 2003 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of thirdparty sales the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms 

  

our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us and invest in several areas of technology including seller platforms search web services and digital initiatives  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

  

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends  for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales gross profit and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 

  

in addition the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 

  

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

  

critical accounting judgments 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need 

  

     

to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured additionally revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 

  

we evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned under our syndicated stores arrangements we record gross product sales and costs since we own the inventory set prices and are responsible for fulfillment and customer service and the other business earns a sales commission 

  

product sales and shipping revenues net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier return allowances which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns are estimated using historical experience amounts paid in advance for subscription services including amounts received for online dvd rentals amazon prime and other membership programs are deferred and classified in “unearned revenue” on our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the subscription term 

  

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction while inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “net sales” 

  

commissions and perunit fees received from thirdparty sellers and similar amounts earned through amazon enterprise solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the thirdparty seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured when we are responsible for fulfillmentrelated services commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer we record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience 

  

inventories 

  

inventories consisting of products available for sale are accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category based on this evaluation we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value 

  

we provide fulfillmentrelated services in connection with certain of our agreements in those arrangements as well as other product sales by third parties the thirdparty maintains ownership of the related products 

  

internaluse software 

  

included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internaluse software and website development including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business as required by statement of position 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internaluse software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internaluse software are expensed as incurred 

  

during 2005 2004 and 2003 we capitalized 90 million including 11 million of stockbased compensation 44 million and 30 million of costs associated with internaluse software and website development which are partially offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of 50 million 30 million and 24 million 

  

currency effect on intercompany balances 

  

a provision of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 52 foreign currency translation  requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered longterm investments in which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future be excluded in the determination of net income our international operations are financed in part by the us parent company prior to the fourth quarter of 2003 currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were recorded to stockholders’ equity deficit as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts during the fourth quarter of 2003 we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and accordingly upon consolidation any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurements of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net income in accordance with sfas no 52 currency adjustments arising before the fourth quarter of 2003 continue to be included as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive income” on our consolidated balance sheets resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany balances using exchange rates at the reporting dates we recorded a loss of 47 million in 2005 and gains of 41 million and 36 million in 2004 and 2003 

  

valuation of deferred tax assets 

  

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered at december 31 2005 our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance were 291 million which includes 123 million relating to net operating loss carryforwards “nols” that are primarily attributed to stockbased compensation the majority of our nols begin to expire in 2016 

  

additionally we have elected to present our nol deferred tax assets attributed to stockbased compensation net of the related allowance as of the adoption of sfas 123r total gross deferred tax assets related to our nols at december 31 2005 were 616 million relating to approximately 19 billion of nols 

  

sfas 109 accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors in accordance with the provisions of sfas 109 we allocate our valuation allowance to current and longterm deferred tax assets on a prorata basis 

  

we recorded a tax benefit in 2005 of 90 million representing 022 and 021 of basic and diluted earnings per share as we determined at year end that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable the range of possible judgments relating to valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide for example had we determined that the weight of available evidence did not support a decision that these deferred tax assets are realizable the “provision benefit for income taxes” would have been an expense of 185 million for 2005 rather than an expense of 95 million for the same period at december 31 2005 we continue to have a valuation allowance of 213 million which relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the occurrence of future capital gains 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

as of january 1 2005 we early adopted sfas 123r which requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1  free cash flow was 529 million for 2005 which includes the effect of a 40 million patent litigation settlement compared to 477 million and 347 million for 2004 and 2003 operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and timing of capital expenditures working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality the timing of expense payments discounts offered by vendors vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 20 billion and 18 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004 amounts held in foreign currencies were 905 million and 970 million at the end of 2005 and 2004 and were primarily euros british pounds and yen 

  

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stockbased compensation was presented in operating cash flows along with other tax cash flows sfas 123r supersedes prior guidance and requires tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows which is effectively a reclassification between operating cash flows and financing cash flows versus prior presentation tax benefits resulting from stockbased compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were 7 million 8 million and 4 million for december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 with the amount for 2005 treated as financing cash flows to the detriment of operating cash flow we expect the corresponding amount for 2006 to increase substantially and possibly be in excess of 100 million although the actual amount 

  

   

is subject to considerable variability accordingly amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for 2006 will be negatively effected in comparison to prior results however the underlying economic substance is not effected by this change in reporting classification 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 733 million 566 million and 393 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers from thirdparty sellers and from nonretail activities such as through our cobranded credit card agreements amazon enterprise solutions and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation less amounts capitalized pursuant to sop 981 that are reflected in cash used in investing activities payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm debt obligations cash received from customers thirdparty sellers and nonretail activities generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels as well as increases or decreases in vendorrelated receivables for cooperative marketing volume rebates and other incentives during 2005 cash paid to inventory suppliers totaled 55 billion compared to 46 billion and 34 billion in 2004 and 2003 cash paid to inventory suppliers is also affected by our efforts to add product categories increase selection of products we offer for sale improve availability in both existing and new product categories and take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the 40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 8—other operating expense income” 

  

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities net cash flows from acquisitions and purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development costs net cash used in investing activities was 778 million and 317 million in 2005 and 2004 while cash provided by investing activities was 236 million in 2003 with the variability caused primarily by purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities capital expenditures were 204 million 89 million and 46 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites as well as investments in fulfillmentrelated assets and technology infrastructure capital expenditures included 79 million 44 million and 30 million for internaluse software and website development during 2005 2004 and 2003 stockbased compensation capitalized for internaluse software and website development costs does not affect cash flows we believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition we also purchased certain companies in 2005 and 2004 resulting in cash payments net of acquired cash of 24 million and 71 million 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 193 million 97 million and 332 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations which were 270 million in 2005 157 million in 2004 and 495 million in 2003 during 2005 we repaid €200 million of our 6875 peacs for 265 million during 2004 we repaid 154 million to redeem a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt and other” cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options which were 66 million 60 million and 163 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 we expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will continue to decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stockbased awards 

  

in 2005 we recorded a net tax provision of 95 million and in 2004 we recorded a net tax benefit of 233 million a majority of this provision and benefit is noncash as we have deferred tax assets resulting from our history of net operating losses 

  

in february 2006 we announced plans to redeem €250 million principal of our 6875 peacs which is expected to close march 7 2006 for a cash payment of approximately 305 million at the euro to us dollar exchange rate on january 31 2006 which includes 1 million of interest under the indenture governing the 6875 peacs no premium is required 

  

additionally in february 2006 our board of directors authorized a new debt repurchase program replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase through open market repurchases or private transactions redeem or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of 500 million of our outstanding 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs 

  

since our 6875 peacs which are due in 2010 are denominated in euros our us dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the euro to us dollar exchange rate as a result any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and to the extent we make principal payments the amount of us dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement additionally since our interest payable on our 6875 peacs is due in euros the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment gains or losses on the remeasurement of our eurodenominated interest payable are classified as “other income net” on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

our inventory turnover was 14 and 16 for 2005 and 2004 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors including our product mix our mix of thirdparty sales and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers among other factors the decline in inventory turnover is primarily attributed to our emphasis on maintaining wide merchandise selection of instock inventory which enables faster delivery of products to our customers 

  

the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december 31 2005 

  

       

pledged securities 

  

we are required to pledge a portion of our cash equivalents or marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations and for real estate lease agreements the amount required to be pledged for real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases with fluctuations in our market capitalization which is common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock and based on our creditrating information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows 

  

       

we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part i “business—additional factors that may affect future results” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities from lenders repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

results of operations 

  

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

  

net sales and gross profit 

  

net sales information is as follows 

  

   

revenue increased 23 in 2005 due to an acceleration of revenue growth in our north america segment offset by slower revenue growth in our international segment representing a decrease from 31 revenue growth in 2004 and 34 revenue growth in 2003 excluding the effect of exchange rates revenue growth was 24 26 and 28 for 2005 2004 and 2003 changes in currency exchange rates negatively affected 2005 net sales by 73 million and positively affected net sales by 276 million and 232 million for 2004 and 2003 for a discussion of the effect on revenue growth by changes in exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below 

  

north america revenue growth rates increased to 22 in 2005 compared to 18 growth rates in 2004 and 2003 the increased growth rate primarily reflects an increase in unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers and by increased selection such as through additions to our product categories as well as increases in our servicerelated revenues particularly from amazon enterprise solutions and from our cobranded credit card agreement changes in currency exchange rates positively affected 2005 2004 and 2003 net sales for our north america segment by 5 million 5 million and 6 million 

  

international revenue growth rates declined to 23 in 2005 compared to 53 and 71 growth rates in 2004 and 2003 this decrease in revenue growth is primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates which negatively affected revenue growth by 78 million for 2005 and positively affected revenue growth by 271 million and 226 million for 2004 and 2003 additionally revenue growth was affected by declining revenue growth rates in certain product categories primarily media excluding the effect of exchange rates revenue growth was 25 40 and 52 for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

we endeavor to increase sales over time by continuing to offer low prices including from free shipping convenience including new and innovative features such as personalization 1click and search inside the book and broad product availability and selection including from new product categories and from thirdparty sales 

  

we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated net sales additionally as we continue to offer increased selection lower prices and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase see “supplemental information” below 

  

gross profit information is as follows 

  

   

the increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003 corresponds with increases in sales including increases in sales by thirdparty sellers increases in amounts earned from our cobranded credit card agreements and increases in amounts earned from amazon enterprise solutions offset by our free shipping offers and lower prices for customers generally our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including our product service and geographic mix of sales sales volumes by thirdparty sellers changes in vendor pricing including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances lowering prices for customers including from competitive pricing decisions improvements in product sourcing and inventory management and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and membership offers such free shipping and membership offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales amazon prime introduced in 2005 is a shipping membership program in which members receive free twoday shipping and discounted overnight shipping we have offered free membership trials for amazon prime and we expect to continue to offer these trials in the future we view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 

  

sales of products by thirdparty sellers on our websites continue to increase representing 28 26 and 22 of unit sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit if product sales by thirdparty sellers continue to increase the higher gross margin attributes of these sales will offset decreases in our gross margins due to lowering prices for customers over time by offering price reductions free shipping offers and promotions 

  

gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “effect of exchange rates” below 

  

north america segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 30 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increases in sales by thirdparty sellers increases in amounts earned from our cobranded credit card agreement and increases in amounts earned from service agreements offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by a third party 

  

  

north america segment gross margin in 2004 was consistent with 2003 changes in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories and price reductions for our customers including from our yearround free shipping offers were offset partially by increased sales volume by thirdparty sellers and volume discounts we receive from our product suppliers 

  

international segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 162 basis points compared to 2004 resulting from several factors including increasing sales by thirdparty sellers and increases in discounts we receive from our product suppliers offset partially by changes in mix of product sales and our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers including from our yearround free shipping offers 

  

international segment gross margins in 2004 declined 70 basis points compared to 2003 resulting from efforts to continue reducing prices for customers including from our free shipping offers and from a shift in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories offset partially by increases in sales volume by thirdparty sellers 

  

supplemental information 

  

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

  

     

we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products as well as through membership in amazon prime to the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate including memberships in amazon prime our net cost of shipping will increase we seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies in addition we anticipate that the costs of lowering prices over time will be partially mitigated to the extent product sales by thirdparty sellers continue to increase 

  

supplemental information about our net sales is as follows 

  

    

information about operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation was as follows in millions 

  

   

see item 8 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

  

fulfillment 

  

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2005 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels our mix of product sales payment processing and related transaction costs including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain thirdparty seller transactions and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity fulfillment includes stockbased compensation of 16 million 10 million and 18 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs including those from our guarantee for certain thirdparty seller transactions our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume of units received and fulfilled the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties and our ability to reduce customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features the mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of products we sell additionally because payment processing costs associated with thirdparty seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs and our a to z guarantee costs associated with these transactions are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales our increasing thirdparty sales have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales 

  

we expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2005 and 2004 through gains in efficiencies as well as increases in leased warehouse space we plan to continue expanding our worldwide fulfillment capacity in order to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties where we provide the fulfillment we expect absolute amounts spent in fulfillment and fulfillmentrelated cost of sales to increase over time 

  

marketing 

  

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates and syndicated stores programs sponsored search portal advertising email campaigns 

  

and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense marketing includes stockbased compensation of 6 million 4 million and 5 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003 these increases correspond with revenue growth as we utilized variable online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search and other variable marketing initiatives 

  

while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely we expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time 

  

technology and content 

  

we significantly increased our spending in technology and content in 2005 which corresponds with our focus on several technology initiatives we have added a significant number of computer scientists and software engineers to our staff so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us improve our process efficiency and invest in several areas of technology including seller platforms search web services and digital initiatives we believe these initiatives that we are funding are important to our longerterm success see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview” for a discussion of how management views the competitive landscape and importance of innovation we intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add computer scientists and software engineers to our staff and expect absolute amounts spent in technology and content to increase over time technology and content includes stockbased compensation of 45 million 32 million and 50 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

for the years ended 2005 2004 and 2003 we capitalized 90 million including 11 million of stockbased compensation 44 million and 30 million of costs associated with internaluse software and website development which are partially offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of 50 million 30 million and 24 million fixed assets associated with capitalized internaluse software content and website development net of accumulated depreciation were 87 million and 47 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 capitalized internaluse software is amortized over a useful life of two years 

  

a significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the us and most of them are allocated to our north america segment 

  

general and administrative 

  

the increase in spending in general and administrative in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses professional fees and legal costs offset by a 12 million credit in 2005 for actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs previously incurred by us general and administrative includes stockbased compensation of 20 million 12 million and 15 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 we expect absolute amounts spent in general and administrative to increase over time 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

prior to january 1 2005 we accounted for stockbased awards under the intrinsic value method which followed the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations the intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units at their estimated fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and for stock options to the extent option 

  

exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant also to the extent stock awards were subject to an exchange offer other modifications or performance criteria such awards were subject to variable accounting treatment to the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

  

as of january 1 2005 we early adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 123 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method under sfas 123r the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including types of awards employee class and historical experience actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates for example in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a benefit of 10 million 6 million net of tax or 001 per diluted share representing the cumulative effect of slightly increasing the rate of forfeitures expected over the life of issued stock awards based on our historical experience additionally because we implemented sfas 123r we no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment 

  

the adoption of sfas 123r resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of 26 million in 2005 which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 

  

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stockbased compensation was presented in operating cash flows along with other tax cash flows in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 0015 classification in the statement of cash flows of the income tax benefit received by a company upon exercise of a nonqualified employee stock option sfas 123r supersedes eitf 0015 amends sfas 95 statement of cash flows and requires tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows which is effectively a reclassification between operating cash flows and financing cash flows versus prior presentation tax benefits resulting from stockbased compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were 7 million 8 million and 4 million for december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 with the amount for 2005 treated as financing cash flows to the detriment of operating cash flow we expect the corresponding amount for 2006 to increase substantially and possibly be in excess of 100 million although the actual amount is subject to considerable variability accordingly amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for 2006 will be negatively effected in comparison to prior results however the underlying economic substance is not effected by this change in reporting classification 

  

on march 29 2005 the sec published staff accounting bulletin sab no 107 which provides the staff’s views on a variety of matters relating to stockbased payments sab 107 requires stockbased compensation be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation we have reclassified stockbased compensation from prior periods to correspond to current period presentation within the same operating expense line items as cash compensation paid to employees 

  

stockbased compensation was 87 million 58 million and 88 million during 2005 2004 and 2003 we applied the fair value accounting provisions of sfas 123r for 2005 compared with the application of apb no 25 including variable accounting treatment on certain awards for 2004 and 2003 because of the application of different methods of accounting as well as the effects of variable accounting treatment in 2004 and 2003 stockbased compensation for 2005 is not comparable to prior periods as of december 31 2005 there was 169 million of total unrecognized compensation cost net of forfeitures of 106 million related to unvested stockbased compensation arrangements 

  

other operating expense income 

  

other operating expense was 47 million in 2005 primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for 40 million as well as amortization of other intangibles of 5 million other operating income was 8 million for 2004 and other operating expense was 3 million for 2003 which includes restructuringrelated credits net of 9 million in 2004 and amortization of other intangibles of 1 million and 3 million in 2004 and 2003 

  

during 2004 we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring which we had been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions was necessary for our future needs we reduced our restructuringrelated liability resulting in a gain of 13 million for 2004 lease payments for this office space are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

in 2004 we streamlined our organizational structure in france to reduce our operating costs these efforts were primarily focused on eliminating frenchoffice positions in managerial professional clerical and technical roles the number of employees affected totaled 52 and resulted in severance costs of 4 million classified in “other operating expense income” on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

income from operations 

  

our income from operations was 432 million 440 million and 270 million during 2005 2004 and 2003 the decrease in 2005 from 2004 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content an increase in stockbased compensation that is now recorded under sfas 123r fair value accounting and a payment of 40 million to settle a patent lawsuit these increased expenditures were partially offset by higher net sales and gross profit the increase in operating income in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily attributed to increases in net sales and gross profit growth and leveraging operating expenses relative to net sales income from operations was negatively affected by yearoveryear changes in exchange rates in 2005 and positively affected in 2004 and 2003 

  

net interest expense 

  

the primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our longterm debt instruments including a 900 million principal balance of our 475 us convertible subordinated notes and a €490 million 580 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2005 principal balance of our 6875 peacs at december 31 2005 interest expense was 92 million 107 million and 130 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of 265 million and 150 million in 2005 and 2004 

  

at december 31 2005 our total longterm indebtedness was 152 billion compared to 186 billion at december 31 2004 in february 2006 we announced plans to redeem €250 million principal of our 6875 peacs which is expected to close march 7 2006 for a cash payment of approximately 305 million at the euro to us dollar exchange rate on january 31 2006 which includes 1 million of interest see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt and other” 

  

we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market mutual funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested 

  

other income expense net 

  

other income expense net was 2 million 5 million and 7 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 and consisted primarily of gains losses on sales of marketable securities foreigncurrency transaction gains losses and other miscellaneous losses net 

  

foreigncurrency transaction gains losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6875 peacs since these payments are settled in euros the balance of interest payable which is paid annually in february is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and euro between reporting dates and payment 

  

remeasurements and other 

  

remeasurements and other consisted of the following 

  

       

income taxes 

  

we recorded a tax benefit in 2005 of 90 million representing 022 and 021 of basic and diluted earnings per share as we determined at year end that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable excluding this 90 million benefit our effective tax rate would have been significantly higher than the 35 statutory rate resulting from steps we initiated to establish our european headquarters in luxembourg which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time associated with the establishment of our european headquarters we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 from the us to international locations which resulted in taxable income and an increase in our effective tax rate we will initiate similar asset transfers in 2006 to finalize our european headquarters transition and we expect this will result in an effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes significantly higher than the statutory rate for 2006 there is potential for significant volatility of our 2006 effective tax rate due to several factors including from variability in accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates since we have deferred tax assets related to our nols these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006 which we expect to be approximately 25 million compared with 12 million in 2005 and 4 million in 2004 we are not endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a financial reporting basis instead we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis 

  

we recorded a tax benefit in 2004 of 244 million representing 060 and 057 of basic and diluted earnings per share and a credit to “stockholders’ equity deficit” of 106 million as we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable 

  

at december 31 2005 our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance are 291 million which includes 123 million relating to nols that are primarily attributed to stockbased 

  

compensation the majority of which begin to expire in 2016 and 18 million relating to capital loss carryforwards that expire in 2006 and thereafter the remaining portion relates to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 

  

the 123 million nols primarily attributed to stockbased compensation are presented net of fullyreserved nol deferred tax assets totaling 493 million total gross deferred tax assets related to our nols at december 31 2005 were 616 million relating to approximately 19 billion of nols 

  

net income 

  

net income was 359 million 588 million and 35 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 we believe that yearoveryear changes in net income are not necessarily predictive of our future net income results for a variety of reasons for example in 2005 we recorded a provision for income taxes of 95 million and in 2004 we recorded a net income tax benefit of 233 million included in these amounts in 2005 and 2004 were tax benefits of 90 million and 244 million resulting from our determination that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable additionally the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs and intercompany balances resulted in net gains in 2005 and net charges in 2004 and 2003 associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates accordingly we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and change in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results 

  

effect of exchange rates 

  

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in millions except per share data 

  

      

nongaap financial measures 

  

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measure of “free cash flow” meets the definition of a nongaap financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 

  

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations in limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations however since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows 

  

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “net cash provided by operating activities” for 2005 2004 and 2003 in millions 

  

   

in addition we provide operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation which excludes the employer portion of payroll tax expense we provide this information to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements stockbased compensation programs are an important element of the company’s compensation structure and all forms of stockbased awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments 

  

information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market mutual funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

  

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2005 in millions except percentages 

  

   

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2004 in millions except percentages 

  

   

at december 31 2005 we had longterm debt of 152 billion primarily associated with our 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs which are due in 2009 and 2010 the fair value of our longterm debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

  

based upon quoted market prices at prevailing exchange rates the fair value of the 6875 peacs was €495 million or 586 million outstanding principal of €490 million and €691 million or 936 million outstanding principal of €690 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 and the fair value of the 475 convertible subordinated notes was 868 million and 907 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

during 2005 net sales from our international segment consisting of wwwamazoncouk  wwwamazonde  wwwamazonfr  wwwamazoncojp  and wwwjoyocom  accounted for 45 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from these websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include euros british pounds and yen the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2005 international segment revenues declined 78 million and our operating results declined 7 million in comparison with the prior year 

  

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2005 of 905 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 45 million 91 million and 181 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” as defined by sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  

  

we have foreign exchange risk related to our 6875 peacs which have an outstanding principal balance at december 31 2005 of €490 million 580 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2005 due to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio which we cannot predict our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6875 peacs since issuance in february 2000 has increased by 97 million as of december 31 2005 based on the outstanding 6875 peacs’ principal balance an assumed 5 10 and 20 weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro would result in additional losses of approximately 29 million 58 million and 116 million recorded to “remeasurements and other” additionally we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6875 peacs to protect against exchange rate fluctuations assuming the us dollar weakens against the euro by 5 10 and 20 in 2006 we would incur 2 million 4 million and 8 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange 

  

see “effect of exchange rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates 

  

investment risk 

  

as of december 31 2005 our recorded basis in equity securities including both publiclytraded and private companies was 14 million including 6 million classified as “marketable securities” and 8 million classified as “other assets” we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are otherthantemporary the fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general companyspecific circumstances and changes in general economic conditions based on the fair value of the publiclytraded equity securities we held at december 31 2005 of 44 million recorded basis of 7 million an assumed 15 30 and 50 adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately 7 million 13 million and 22 million

the board of directors and stockholders 

amazoncom inc 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that amazoncom inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria amazoncom inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that amazoncom inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion amazoncom inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the coso criteria

seasonality 

  

our business is affected by seasonality which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter 

  

employees 

  

we employed approximately 9000 fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2004 however employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business additionally we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel on a seasonal basis none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract hire and retain qualified personnel 

  

available information 

  

our investor relations website is wwwamazoncomir  we make available on this website under “financial documents” free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the us securities and exchange commission “sec” 

  

additional factors that may affect future results 

  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  

we have an accumulated deficit and may incur additional losses 

  

we have incurred significant net losses since we began doing business as of december 31 2004 we had an accumulated deficit of 239 billion and our stockholders’ deficit was 227 million we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and although we earned net income for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 we may incur losses again in the future 

  

we have significant indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had longterm indebtedness of 186 billion we make annual or semiannual interest payments on the indebtedness under our two convertible notes which are due in 2009 and 2010 although we made debt principal reduction payments over the last two years we may incur substantial additional debt in the future and in any event a significant portion of our future cash flow from operating activities is likely to remain dedicated to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on our indebtedness our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions or other purposes in the future as needed to plan for or react to changes in technology and in our business and competition and to react in the event of an economic downturn 

  

there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments or if we fail to comply with covenants in our indebtedness we will be in default in addition we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

see item 1 of part i “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt and other” 

  

we face intense competition 

  

the market segments in which we compete are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including both the retail and ecommerce services industries 

  

many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we have they may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies competitors in both the retail and ecommerce services industries also may be able to devote more resources to technology development fulfillment and marketing than we do 

  

competition in the ecommerce channel may intensify other companies in the retail and ecommerce service industries may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions 

  

as various internet market segments obtain large loyal customer bases participants in those segments may expand into the market segments in which we operate in addition new and expanded web technologies may further intensify the competitive nature of online retail the nature of the internet as an electronic marketplace facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders it inherently more competitive than conventional retailing formats this increased competition may reduce our sales operating profits or both 

  

our expansion will place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources 

  

we are rapidly and significantly expanding our operations both domestically and internationally and will continue to expand further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings and customer base such expansion increases the complexity of our business and places a significant strain on our management operations technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage it effectively our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth negatively affect our operating results and harm our business 

  

our expansion into new product areas and geographic regions subjects us to business and competitive risks 

  

we do not expect to benefit in our newer market segments whether products services or new geographic areas from the firsttomarket advantage that we experienced in the us online book channel our gross profits in our newer business activities may be lower than in our older business activities in addition we may have limited or no experience in new product and service activities and new geographic areas and our customers may not favorably receive our new businesses our newer market segments may present special technology challenges that we have not faced before to the extent we pursue commercial agreements acquisitions andor strategic alliances to facilitate new product or service activities or geographic expansion the agreements acquisitions andor alliances may not be successful if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth negatively affect our operating results and harm our business 

  

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth 

  

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future net sales and rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our net sales fall short of our expectations 

  

our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions throughout the world a softening of demand whether caused by changes in consumer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth terrorist attacks and armed hostilities create economic and consumer uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue or growth such events could create delays in and increase the cost of product shipments which may decrease demand revenue growth may not be sustainable and our companywide percentage growth rate may decrease in the future 

  

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

finally both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality are likely to affect our business internet usage generally slows during the summer months and sales in almost all of our product groups particularly toys and electronics usually increase significantly in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 

  

we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

  

our international activities have become increasingly significant to our revenues and profits and we plan over time to continue to expand our reach in international market segments we have relatively little experience in purchasing marketing and distributing products or services for these market segments and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages it is costly to establish international facilities and operations promote our brand internationally and develop localized websites stores and other systems we may not succeed in these efforts our net sales from international market segments may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining the related operations and therefore these operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

  

our international sales and related operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling abroad including but not limited to risks with respect to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as the international ecommerce channel continues to grow competition will likely intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand name recognition in addition governments in foreign jurisdictions may regulate ecommerce or other online services in such areas as licenses content privacy network security copyright encryption taxation or distribution we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth in international market segments 

  

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

  

if we do not successfully operate our fulfillment centers it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand because it is difficult to predict demand we may not manage our facilities in an optimal way which may result in excess or insufficient inventory and warehousing fulfillment and distribution capacity a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring us to make longzone shipments or partial shipments from one or more locations orders from several of our internationallyfocused websites are fulfilled primarily from a single fulfillment center and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements operating our fulfillment network becomes more challenging and there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively 

  

we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to our fulfillment centers and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they 

  

experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors 

  

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies in our fulfillment centers thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory in and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability or failure of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

  

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

  

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to be realized during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year if we do not stock popular products in sufficient amounts or fail to have sources to timely restock popular products such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make longzone shipments or partial shipments from one or more locations orders from several of our internationallyfocused websites are fulfilled primarily from a single fulfillment center and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery especially for the holiday season if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday or other demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers during these peak periods and third parties that provide fulfillment services to our customers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand finally we along with our customer service cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff customer service centers 

  

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable our accounts payable balance should decline during the first three months following yearend which will result in a decline in the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

  

we may enter into commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships with other companies we have entered into agreements to provide ecommerce services to other businesses and we plan to enter into similar agreements in the future including as part of our merchants syndicated stores and merchantcom initiatives under such agreements we may perform services such as providing our technology services such as search browse and personalization permitting other businesses and individuals to offer products or services through our websites and powering thirdparty websites either with or without providing accompanying fulfillment services these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may constrain the number of such agreements we are able to enter into and 

  

may affect our ability to integrate and deliver services under the relevant agreements if we fail to implement maintain and develop successfully the various components of such commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of third party software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of sales that the other company makes therefore if the other business’s website or product or services offering is not successful we may not receive all of the compensation we are otherwise due under the agreement or may not be able to maintain the agreement moreover we may not be able to succeed in our plans to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms 

  

as our commercial agreements expire or otherwise terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of our commercial agreements or both some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as such agreements expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services in addition several past commercial agreements were with companies that experienced business failures and were unable to meet their obligations to us we may in the future enter into further amendments of our commercial agreements or encounter other parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results as an example we are currently in litigation with toysruscom over our commercial agreement and toyruscom’s parent toysrus inc has experienced financial difficulties and announced that it may sell its toy business in the event of the early termination of our commercial agreement with toysruscom we would attempt to replace the product selection currently provided by toysruscom with owned inventory and offerings from other parties but our operating results could be negatively impacted 

  

our present and future thirdparty services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

  

   

   

   

   

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments 

  

we have acquired and invested in a number of companies including our acquisition of joyocom in september 2004 and we may acquire or invest in such as through joint ventures or other business combinations additional companies acquisitions and investments create risks such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

finally as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 

  

our recent acquisition of joyocom creates risks and uncertainties relating to the laws of the people’s republic of china 

  

in september 2004 we acquired joyocom a company organized under the laws of the british virgin islands joyocom operates wwwjoyocom and wwwjoyocomcn in the people’s republic of china “prc” in cooperation with a prc subsidiary and prc affiliates and is subject to many of the risks described in “our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments” and “we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments” in addition the prc regulates joyocom’s business through regulations and license requirements restricting i the scope of foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of certain media products in order to meet the prc local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyocom’s business is operated through a prc subsidiary which acts in cooperation with prc companies owned by nominee shareholders who are prc nationals although we believe joyocom’s structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyocom or its subsidiary or affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyocom were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business 

  

we have foreign exchange risk 

  

the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rates fluctuations has become more pronounced net sales from our international segment represented 44 of our total net sales in 2004 compared to 38 in 2003 and 30 in 2002 see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations – effect of exchange rates” for a table demonstrating the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar 

  

in addition our 6875 peacs are denominated in euros not us dollars we remeasure the principal of the 6875 peacs quarterly based on fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio and record gains or 

  

losses in “remeasurements and other” on our consolidated statements of operations as a result increases in the euro relative to the us dollar increase the us dollar amount we owe as interest and principal furthermore we hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in euros british pounds yen canadian dollars and chinese yuan accordingly if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

  

our investments and the consideration we receive under certain commercial agreements may subject us to a number of risks 

  

in the past we have entered into commercial agreements with other companies including strategic alliances whereby we perform certain ecommerce services and in exchange for our services we received cash equity securities of these companies andor additional benefits such as website traffic the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is dependent on the volume of sales made by the other company in some cases we have also made separate investments in the other company by making a cash payment in exchange for equity securities of that company we may make similar investments in the future to the extent we have received equity securities as compensation fluctuations in the value of such securities will affect our ultimate realization of amounts we have received as compensation for services 

  

in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of our commercial agreements or both we may in the future enter into further amendments of our commercial agreements although these amendments did not affect the amount of unearned revenue previously recorded by us if any the timing of revenue recognition of these recorded unearned amounts was changed to correspond with the terms of the amended agreements to the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable as future amounts are subsequently received such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement 

  

our investments in equity securities are included in “marketable securities” and “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets we regularly review all of our investments in public and private companies for otherthantemporary declines in fair value when we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment below our accounting basis is otherthantemporary we reduce the carrying value of the securities we hold and record a loss in the amount of any such decline in recent years securities of companies in the internet and ecommerce industries have experienced significant difficulties we may conclude in future quarters that the fair values of our investments have experienced additional otherthantemporary declines as of december 31 2004 our recorded basis in equity securities was 27 million including 12 million classified as “marketable securities” and 15 million classified as “other assets” 

  

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

  

we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president chief executive officer and chairman of the board we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

  

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales 

  

customer access to our websites directly affects the volume of goods we sell and the services we offer and thus affects our net sales we experience occasional system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add additional software and hardware and upgrade in an effective manner our systems and network infrastructure it could cause system interruption and adversely affect our operating results 

  

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders should this occur it would make our product offerings less attractive to our customers and our service offerings less attractive to third parties while we do have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

  

we face significant inventory risk 

  

we are exposed to significant inventory risks as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products in order to be successful we must accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product selection and accurately forecast product demand a failure to optimize inventory within our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring us to make split shipments from one or more locations complimentary upgrades and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery 

  

as a result of our thirdparty services relationships with toysruscom babiesruscom target and other companies these parties identify buy and bear the financial risk of inventory obsolescence for their corresponding stores and merchandise as a result if any of these parties fail to forecast product demand or optimize or maintain access to inventory we would receive reduced service fees under the agreements and our business and reputation could be harmed 

  

the acquisition of certain types of inventory or inventory from certain sources may require significant leadtime and prepayment and such inventory may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons 

  

any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

  

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers partners and others to protect our proprietary rights effective trademark service mark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available online 

  

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is inherently difficult and we may not be able to determine the existence or extent of any such unauthorized use the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover we cannot be certain that the 

  

steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our rights or that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

  

third parties that license our proprietary rights may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation in addition the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights trademarks trade dress patents and similar proprietary rights other parties may claim that we infringed their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the imposition of damages that we must pay we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements 

  

we have a limited operating history and our stock price is highly volatile 

  

we have a relatively short operating history and as an ecommerce company we have a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of these events may cause our stock price to rise or fall and may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities 

  

future volatility in our stock price could force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

  

government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

  

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services these regulations and laws may cover taxation user privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection the provision of online payment services broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership sales and other taxes libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business in addition many jurisdictions currently regulate “auctions” and “auctioneers” and may regulate online auction services jurisdictions may also regulate other consumertoconsumer online markets including certain aspects of amazon marketplace this could in turn diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

  

taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 

  

we do not collect sales taxes or other taxes with respect to shipments of most of our goods into states other than washington north dakota and kansas under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record of the applicable merchandise and we are obligated to collect sales tax in most states in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional strategic alliances requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of those networks along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on outofjurisdiction companies that engage in ecommerce a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

  

currently decisions of the us supreme court restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering various initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives addressed the supreme court’s constitutional concerns and resulted in a reversal of its current position we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in states other than washington north dakota and kansas the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us and could decrease our future sales 

  

our vendor relationships subject us to a number of risks 

  

although we continue to increase the number of vendors that supply products to us and no vendor accounts for 10 or more of our inventory purchases we have significant vendors that are important to our sourcing we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise to us on acceptable terms we may not be able to acquire merchandise from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms 

  

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

  

some of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls certain businesses and individuals also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient resources to protect themselves from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our vendor agreements with our distributors manufacturers and third party sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

  

we could be liable for breaches of security on our website 

  

a fundamental requirement for ecommerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

  

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers 

  

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition we are aware that governmental agencies have investigated the provision of online payment services and could require changes in the way this business is conducted under merchants marketplace and certain other of our programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions under our a2z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our third party sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results any costs we incur as a result of liability because of our a2z guarantee or otherwise could harm our business in addition the functionality of our payments program depends on certain thirdparty vendors delivering services if these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services our payments program and our businesses that use it may not be viable finally we may be unable to prevent sellers in our merchants marketplace merchantcom and certain other programs from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers 

  

we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards 

  

technology in the ecommerce industry changes rapidly we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and preferences and industry standards competitors often introduce new products and services with new technologies these changes and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing websites and proprietary technology obsolete 

  

the internet as a medium for commerce is subject to uncertainty 

  

consumer use of the internet as a medium for commerce is subject to uncertainty while the number of internet users has been rising the internet infrastructure may not expand fast enough to meet the increased levels of demand in addition activity that diminishes the experience for internet users such as spyware spoof emails viruses and spam directed at internet users as well as viruses and “denial of service” attacks directed at internet companies and service providers may discourage people from using the internet including for commerce furthermore newer users of the internet could be less active ecommerce customers compared to our earlier customers if use of the internet as a medium for commerce grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our sales would be lower than expected and our business could be harmed

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce the 

  

amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion fulfillment center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which the company enters into maintains and develops commercial agreements acquisitions and strategic transactions and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1 of part i “additional factors that may affect future results” which along with the previous discussion describes some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations 

  

overview 

  

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites  the products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors publishers and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties 

  

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1  free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists to increase sales we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability increasing selection expanding product information improving ease of use and earning customer trust our price reductions take several forms we reduce the sales prices of products we sell we recruit thirdparty sellers to compete with us on product detail pages and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer 

  

we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders we moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002 because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 434 million at december 31 2004 compared with 433 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

we seek to leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable costs per unit our customer experience costs specifically the costs necessary to build enhance and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers are largely fixed in that they do not vary directly with sales the customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs creditcard processing fees bad debt picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and most aspects of our marketing costs to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing seek to maximize volume discounts available to us from suppliers and focus on maintaining a lean culture including by reducing defects in our processes 

  

   

because we are able to turn our inventory quickly we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 16 18 19 for 2004 2003 and 2002 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix our mix of thirdparty sales our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our future investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 53 50 and 52 for 2004 2003 and 2002 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of thirdparty sales the mix of suppliers and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms 

  

our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lowercost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

  

our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results including trends for example our total revenue profit and operating and free cash flow have recently benefited significantly from weakness in the us dollar in comparison to the currencies of our internationallyfocused websites while we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders it is important to also evaluate our growth rates before the effect of currency changes for example while our revenues increased 31 during 2004 in comparison with the prior year holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 26 in the future this trend may reverse and our consolidated us dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our localcurrency growth rates 

  

we may have significant variation in our future reported results we believe that our reported net income for 2004 should not be viewed on its own as a material positive event and the yearoveryear increase in net income of 553 million is not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons for example in 2004 we had a primarily noncash net benefit from income taxes of 233 million resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations additionally the remeasurement of our 6875 premium adjustable convertible securities “peacs” and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates accordingly we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and changes in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results 

  

for additional information about each line item summarized above refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

  

critical accounting judgments 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 

  

     

liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured additionally revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 

  

we evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned under our syndicated stores arrangements we record gross product sales and costs since we own the inventory set prices and are responsible for fulfillment and customer service and the other business earns a sales commission 

  

product sales and shipping revenues net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier return allowances which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns are estimated using historical experience amounts paid in advance for subscription services including amounts received for online dvd rentals and other membership programs are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term 

  

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction while inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in “net sales” 

  

commissions and perunit fees received from thirdparty sellers and similar amounts earned through our merchantcom program are recognized when the item is sold by the thirdparty seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured we record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience 

  

outbound shipping charges to customers are included in “net sales” and excluding amounts earned from thirdparty sellers where we don’t provide fulfillment services amounted to 420 million 372 million and 365 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

inventories 

  

inventories consisting of products available for sale are accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category based on this evaluation we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value 

  

we provide fulfillmentrelated services in connection with certain of our merchants and merchantcom programs in those arrangements as well as other product sales by third parties the thirdparty maintains ownership of the related products 

  

internaluse software 

  

included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internaluse software and website development including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business in accordance with statement of position “sop” 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internaluse software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internaluse software are expensed as incurred 

  

during 2004 2003 and 2002 we capitalized 44 million 30 million and 25 million of costs associated with development of internaluse software which is offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of 30 million 24 million and 26 million 

  

restructuring estimates 

  

restructuringrelated liabilities include estimates for among other things anticipated disposition of lease obligations key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated timing of sublease rentals estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs and estimates for brokerage and other related costs we periodically evaluate and if necessary adjust our estimates based on currentlyavailable information additionally we may determine as we did in 2004 that certain of the office space vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring which we have been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions may be necessary for our future needs to the extent we elect to utilize this office space we adjust our restructuringrelated liability and classify future payments to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

currency effect on intercompany balances 

  

a provision of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 52 foreign currency translation  requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered longterm investments in which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future be excluded in the determination of net income our international operations are financed in part by the us parent company prior to the fourth quarter of 2003 currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were recorded to stockholders’ deficit as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts during the fourth quarter of 2003 we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and accordingly upon consolidation any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurements of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net 

  

income in accordance with sfas no 52 currency adjustments arising before the fourth quarter of 2003 continue to be included as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive income” on our consolidated balance sheets resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany balances using exchange rates at the reporting dates we recorded gains of 41 million and 36 million for 2004 and 2003 repayments among the entities during 2004 were 210 million 

  

valuation of deferred tax assets 

  

sfas 109 “ accounting for income taxes” requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors at december 31 2004 our net deferred tax assets are 363 million comprised of approximately 270 million relating to our net operating loss carryforwards “nols” with the remaining portion related to temporary timing differences between tax and financial reporting classification of deferred tax assets between current and longterm categories is based on the expected timing of realization and the valuation allowance is allocated on a prorata basis 

  

we had a net tax benefit in 2004 of 233 million resulting primarily from the effect of changes in our valuation assessment of deferred tax assets during 2004 in connection with this assessment we also recorded a net credit to “stockholders’ deficit” of 106 million on our consolidated balance sheet in 2004 the range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide for example had we determined that the weight of available evidence did not support a decision that a portion of our deferred tax asset will be realized the amount recorded to “provision benefit for income taxes” would have been an expense of 12 million rather than a benefit of 233 million for 2004 alternatively if we had concluded that the weight of available evidence supported a decision that substantially all of our deferred tax assets may be realized we would have recorded a substantially larger credit to “stockholders’ deficit” 

  

significant judgment is required in making this assessment and it is very difficult to predict when if ever our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets are realizable 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1  free cash flow was 477 million for 2004 compared to 346 million for 2003 an increase of 38 operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality the timing of expense payments discounts offered by vendors vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which were 18 billion and 14 billion at the end of 2004 and 2003 amounts held in foreign currencies were 970 million and 764 million at the end of 2004 and 2003 and were primarily euros british pounds and yen 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 567 million 392 million and 174 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers and thirdparty sellers offset by cash payments we make to suppliers of products and services employee compensation credit card transaction fees bad debt and interest payments on our longterm debt obligations cash received from 

  

   

customers and thirdparty sellers generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels during 2004 payments to product merchandise suppliers which do not include payments to transportation suppliers totaled 46 billion an increase of 12 billion over the prior year the increase in payments to product merchandise suppliers corresponds with cost of sales and with our efforts to add product categories increase selection of products we offer for sale improve availability in both existing and new product categories and take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers and is also affected by foreign exchange rates 

  

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development costs cash used in investing activities was 318 million in 2004 and 122 in 2002 while cash provided by investing activities was 237 million in 2003 with the variability caused primarily by maturities of marketable securities our capital expenditures including internaluse software and website development were 89 million 46 million and 39 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites over time we believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition 

  

in september 2004 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of joyocom at a purchase price of 75 million including a cash payment net of cash acquired of 71 million the assumption of employee stock options and transactionrelated costs cash paid in connection with this acquisition is classified as cash provided by used in investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows the operating results of joyocom did not have a significant effect on consolidated results for 2004 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—business acquisition” 

  

cash used in financing activities was 97 million in 2004 and 332 million in 2003 this compares to cash provided by financing activities of 107 million in 2002 cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options which were 60 million in 2004 163 million in 2003 and 122 million for 2002 we expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stockbased awards cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of longterm debt and payments on capital lease obligations which were 157 million in 2004 495 million in 2003 and 15 million in 2002 during 2004 we paid 154 million which includes a redemption premium of 4 million to redeem a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2009 “475 convertible subordinated notes” see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt and other” 

  

in 2004 we recorded a primarily noncash net benefit of 233 million to “provision benefit for income taxes” relating primarily to our valuation of deferred tax assets we expect our cash taxes paid in 2005 to be approximately 25 million compared with 4 million in 2004 

  

on march 7 2005 we redeemed 200 million euros principal of our 6875 peacs for a cash payment of 266 million which includes 1 million of interest from and including february 16 through march 6 2005 under the indenture no premium was required as of march 7 2005 the outstanding principal amount of our 6875 peacs was 490 million euros 649 million using the euro to us dollar exchange rate on that date 

  

additionally in march 2005 our board of directors authorized a new debt repurchase program replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase through open market repurchases or private transactions redeem or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of 500 million of our outstanding 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs 

  

since our 6875 peacs which are due in 2010 are denominated in euros our us dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the euro to us dollar exchange rate we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency effects on our interest or principal obligations relating to the 6875 peacs and as a result any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and to the extent we make principal payments the amount of us dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement additionally since our interest payable on our 6875 peacs is due in euros the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment gains or losses on the remeasurement of our eurodenominated interest payable are classified as “other expense income net” on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december 31 2004 

  

       

pledged securities 

  

we are required to pledge a portion of our marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations and for real estate lease agreements the amount required to be pledged for real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases with fluctuations in our market capitalization which is common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock and based on our creditrating the change in the total amount of collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows 

  

       

we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part i “business—additional factors that may affect future results” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities from lenders repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

results of operations 

  

we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america and international we present our segment information along the same lines that our chief operating decision maker reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources 

  

net sales and gross profit 

  

net sales information is as follows 

  

   

revenue growth is due primarily to increased demand driven by increased selection lower prices including from our free shipping offers and improved features and services available on our websites revenue growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below for additional information on the effect on reported revenue of changes in exchange rates net sales from “other” consist of nonretail activities such as our merchantcom program miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities and our cobranded credit card program 

  

north america revenue growth rate in 2004 was consistent with 2003 at 18 up from our 2002 growth rate of 12 the increase in growth rates from 2002 reflects our efforts to increase product categories and selection available on our websites and to continue reducing prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers 

  

international revenue growth rate declined in 2004 and 2003 compared to the prior year periods which reflects several factors these factors include the increasing size of our business which naturally causes growth rates to decline over time offset by our customer experience initiatives including new category introductions increased selection the introduction of our thirdparty offerings in the uk germany japan and france and our efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our free shipping offers international segment revenue growth rates are also affected by changes in exchange rates 

  

the relative mix of worldwide net sales attributed to our international segment continues to increase and we expect that over time our international segment will represent 50 or more of our consolidated total additionally as we continue to offer increased selection lower prices and additional product lines in our electronics and other general merchandise category we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase 

  

gross profit information is as follows 

  

   

the increases in gross profit in absolute terms during 2004 and 2003 compared to prior year periods correspond with increased revenue including from increased sales volume by thirdparty sellers offset by our yearround free shipping offers and lower prices for customers generally our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including our product and geographic mix of sales during the year sales volumes by thirdparty sellers changes in vendor pricing lowering prices for customers including from competitive pricing decisions and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping offers free shipping offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales we view our shipping offers as an effective marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely additionally in 2005 we introduced a new shipping membership program amazon prime in which members receive free twoday shipping and discounted overnight shipping 

  

north america segment gross margin in 2004 was consistent with 2003 with each of these years down slightly from 2002 changes in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories and price reductions for our customers including from our yearround free shipping offers were offset partially by increased sales volume by thirdparty sellers and volume discounts we receive from our product suppliers 

  

international segment gross margins declined during 2004 and 2003 compared to prior periods resulting from our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers including from our free shipping offers and from a shift in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories offset partially by increases in sales volume by thirdparty sellers 

  

sales of products by thirdparty sellers on our websites continue to increase representing 26 22 and 17 of unit sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit if product sales by thirdparty sellers continue to increase we anticipate the higher gross margin attributes of these sales will partially offset the effect on our gross margins of our strategy to lower prices for customers over time by offering additional or broader price reductions free shipping offers and other promotions 

  

gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates see “effect of exchange rates” below for additional information on the effect on reported gross profit of changes in exchange rates 

  

supplemental information 

  

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows 

  

   

we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products additionally in 2005 we continued to lower prices including by introducing a new shipping membership program amazon prime in which members receive free twoday shipping and discounted overnight shipping we seek to partially offset these costs over time through achieving higher sales volumes negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies including by reducing splitshipments 

  

supplemental information about our net sales is as follows 

  

   

direct segment operating expenses 

  

information about the operating expense categories that we allocate to our segment results is as follows 

  

   

1 fulfillment 

  

the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in comparison with the prior year relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume our mix of product sales costs associated with credit card fees and bad debt costs including costs of our guarantee for certain thirdparty seller transactions the mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of products we sell additionally since credit card fees associated with thirdparty seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and bad debt costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales our increasing thirdparty sales result in increasing fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales also during the third quarter of 2004 we began operation of a new european fulfillment center in scotland and plan to expand our fulfillment capacity in japan in 2005 fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales decreased due to improvements in productivity and accuracy the increase in units fulfilled which leverages the fixedcost portion of our fulfillment network efficiencies gained through utilization of fulfillment services provided by third parties a decline in customer service contacts per unit resulting from improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features offset partially by increases in credit card fees and bad debt including costs of our guarantee for certain thirdparty seller transactions we expect absolute amounts spent in fulfillment to increase over time 

  

2 marketing 

  

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates and syndicated stores programs sponsored search portal advertising email campaigns and other initiatives since our marketing expenses are largely variable we expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing 

  

expense marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2004 corresponding with revenue growth as we utilized variable online marketing channels such as our associates and syndicated stores programs sponsored search and other variable marketing initiatives while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering it indefinitely 

  

3 technology and content 

  

our spending in technology and content has increased as we are adding computer scientists and software engineers to continue to enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us and to improve our process efficiency additionally we continue to invest in several areas of technology including seller platform a9com our whollyowned subsidiary focused on search technology on wwwa9com  wwwamazoncom  and other amazon sites web services and digital initiatives during 2004 2003 and 2002 we capitalized 44 million 30 million and 25 million of costs associated with development of internaluse software which is offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of 30 million 24 million and 26 million we intend to continue investing in these and other initiatives and expect absolute dollars spent in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add computer scientists and software engineers to our staff a significant majority of these costs are incurred in the united states and most of them are allocated to our north america segment 

  

4 general and administrative 

  

the increase in spending in general and administrative is primarily due to increases in professional fees and litigation costs we expect absolute dollars spent in general and administrative to increase over time 

  

on an annual basis in 2004 each category of direct segment operating expenses has either declined or remained flat with 2003 as a percentage of net sales however for the fourth quarter of 2004 expenses for “marketing” and “technology and content” as a percentage of net sales increased in comparison to same period in 2003 and this trend may continue 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

on october 13 2004 the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on the effective date for sfas no 123r sfas 123r sharebased payment  sfas 123r requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested sharebased awards at fair value beginning on july 1 2005 however we will earlyadopt the provisions of sfas 123r with an implementation date of january 1 2005 the adoption of this standard will not affect the stockbased compensation associated with our restricted stock and restricted stock units which are already recorded at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period but will result in the recognition of stockbased compensation in future periods for remaining unvested stock options as of the effective date as of the implementation date of this standard we will no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment we estimate that stockbased compensation for 2005 will be 115 million see also item 8 of part ii “financial statements—note 1—description of business and accounting policies–stockbased compensation” for our sfas no 123 pro forma disclosures using fair value accounting treatment 

  

stockbased compensation consisted of the following 

  

       

at december 31 2004 we had 25 million stock awards outstanding including 18 million stock options with a 1298 weighted average exercise price 6 million restricted stock units and 1 million shares of restricted stock common shares outstanding which include restricted stock plus shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units totaled 434 million and 433 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 for additional information about our stockbased compensation and awards see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—stockbased compensation” 

  

other operating expense income 

  

other operating expense income was 8 million 3 million and 47 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 which includes restructuringrelated expenses credits and amortization of other intangibles restructuringrelated expenses credits were 9 million 0 million and 42 million and amortization of other intangibles was 1 million 3 million and 5 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

during 2004 we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring which we had been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions was necessary for our future needs we have reduced our restructuringrelated liability resulting in a gain of 13 million in 2004 leaserelated payments for this office space approximately 08 million per quarter are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

in 2004 we streamlined our organizational structure in france to reduce our operating costs these efforts were primarily focused on eliminating french office positions in managerial professional clerical and technical roles the number of employees affected totaled 52 and resulted in severance costs of  4 million classified in “other operating expense income” on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

cash payments resulting from our operational restructurings were 9 million 26 million and 45 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 based on currently available information we estimate the remaining restructuringrelated cash outflows will be as follows 

  

    

for additional information about our operational restructuring see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 8—other operating expense income” 

  

income from operations 

  

our income from operations was 440 million 271 million and 64 million during 2004 2003 and 2002 these increases primarily result from net sales and gross profit growth and declines in operating expenses as a percent of net sales as we leverage the fixed cost portion of our cost structure and seek to improve our variable costs through process efficiencies additionally in 2004 and 2003 operating income improved from yearoveryear reductions of 47 million and 8 million in stockbased compensation expense associated with variable accounting offset by increases in stockbased compensation of 18 million and 27 million associated with restricted stock units 

  

net interest expense 

  

the primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our longterm debt instruments including 900 million principal balance of our 475 us convertible subordinated notes and 690 million euros 935 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2004 of 6875 peacs at december 31 2004 interest expense was 107 million 130 million and 143 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of 150 million and 464 million in 2004 and 2003 

  

at december 31 2004 our total longterm indebtedness was 186 billion compared to 195 billion a year ago see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 4—longterm debt and other” 

  

we generally invest our excess cash in “a” rated or higher short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and money market mutual funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them 

  

other income expense net 

  

other income expense net consisted of the following 

  

   

foreigncurrency transaction losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6875 peacs since these payments are settled in euros the balance of interest payable which is paid annually in february is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and euro between reporting dates and payment 

  

remeasurements and other 

  

remeasurements and other consisted of the following 

  

       

income taxes 

  

we record a tax provision or benefit for current and deferred us federal state and foreign income taxes for all periods presented classified as “provision benefit for income taxes” on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets 

  

including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors significant judgment is required in making this assessment and it is very difficult to predict when if ever our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets are realizable 

  

we had a net current tax benefit in 2004 of 233 million representing 057 and 055 of basic and diluted earnings per share resulting primarily from the effect of changes in our valuation assessment of deferred tax assets during 2004 in connection with this assessment we also recorded a net credit to “stockholders’ deficit” of 106 million on our consolidated balance sheet in 2004 

  

at december 31 2004 our net deferred tax assets are 363 million comprised of approximately 270 million relating to our nols with the remaining portion related to temporary timing differences between tax and financial reporting classification of deferred tax assets between current and longterm categories is based on the expected timing of realization and the valuation allowance is allocated ratably 

  

at december 31 2004 our gross deferred tax assets related to our nols were approximately 800 million relating to approximately 26 billion of nols offset by a valuation allowance of approximately 530 million due to uncertainty about their future realization if in the future we determine that the remaining 530 million of nol deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realizable substantially all would be credited to “stockholders’ deficit” rather than the income statement since they primarily relate to taxdeductible stockbased compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes the majority of our nols expire after 2016 

  

we also have approximately 70 million of deferred tax assets relating to approximately 225 million capital loss carryforwards that expire in 2005 and thereafter due to uncertainty regarding future realization we have provided a full valuation allowance for this portion of our deferred tax asset 

  

additionally we expect net income for 2005 to decline because we expect a tax provision in 2005 rather than the large tax benefit we received in 2004 we expect our cash taxes paid in 2005 to be approximately 25 million compared with 4 million in 2004 and 2 million in 2003 

  

net income 

  

net income was 588 million and 35 million in 2004 and 2003 and net loss was 149 million in 2002 we believe that our reported net income for 2004 should not be viewed on its own as a material positive event and the yearoveryear increases in net income of 553 million and 184 million in 2004 and 2003 are not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons for example in 2004 we had a net benefit from income taxes of 233 million representing 057 and 055 of basic and diluted earnings per share resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations additionally the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates accordingly we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and change in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results 

  

effect of exchange rates 

  

the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows 

  

     

nongaap financial measure free cash flow 

  

regulation g conditions for use of nongaap financial measures  and other provisions of the 1934 act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information our measure of “free cash flow” meets the definition of a nongaap financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 

  

free cash flow which we reconcile to “cash provided by used in operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations in limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations however since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows 

  

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions such as our 2004 acquisition of joyocom see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure “cash provided by operating activities” for 2004 2003 and 2002 in thousands 

  

   

guidance 

  

the company provided guidance on february 2 2005 in its earnings release furnished on form 8k as follows 

  

first quarter 2005 guidance 

  

   

   

full year 2005 expectations 

  

   

   

these projections are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part 1 “business — additional factors that may affect future results” 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments 

  

information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in “liquidity and capital resources” above 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in “a” rated or higher short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and money market mutual 

  

funds fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates 

  

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2004 in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2003 in thousands except percentages 

  

   

at december 31 2004 we had longterm debt of 186 billion primarily associated with our 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs which are due in 2009 and 2010 the fair value of our longterm debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

  

based upon quoted market prices at prevailing exchange rates the fair value of the 6875 peacs was 691 million euros 936 million and 690 million euros 870 million at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 and the fair value of the 475 convertible subordinated notes was 907 million outstanding principal of 900 million and 106 billion outstanding principal of 105 billion at december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

during 2004 net sales from our international segment consisting of wwwamazoncouk  wwwamazonde  wwwamazonfr  wwwamazoncojp  and wwwjoyocom  accounted for 44 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from these websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca which is included in our north america segment are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and include euros british pounds yen canadian dollars and chinese yuan the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances for example as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2004 international segment revenues improved 271 million and our operating results improved 20 million in comparison with the prior year 

  

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2004 of 970 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 49 million 97 million and 194 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” as defined by sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  

  

we have foreign exchange risk related to our 6875 peacs which have an outstanding principal balance at december 31 2004 of 690 million euros 935 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2004 due to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio which we cannot predict our principal debt obligation under the 6875 peacs since issuance in february 2000 has increased by 255 million as of december 31 2004 based on the outstanding 6875 peacs’ principal balance an assumed 5 10 and 20 weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro would result in additional losses of approximately 47 million 94 million and 187 million recorded to “remeasurements and other” additionally we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6875 peacs to protect against exchange rate fluctuations assuming the us dollar weakens against the euro by 5 10 and 20 in 2004 we would incur 3 million 6 million and 13 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange

investment risk 

  

as of december 31 2004 our recorded basis in equity securities including both publiclytraded and private companies was 27 million including 12 million classified as “marketable securities” and 15 million classified as “other assets” we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are otherthantemporary the fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general companyspecific circumstances and changes in general economic conditions based on the fair value of the publiclytraded equity securities we held at december 31 2004 of 64 million recorded basis of 20 million an assumed 15 30 and 50 adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately 10 million 19 million and 32 million

report of ernst  young llp 

independent registered public accounting firm 

  

the board of directors and stockholders 

amazoncom inc 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that amazoncom inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria amazoncom inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that amazoncom inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion amazoncom inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the coso criteria 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of amazoncom inc as of december 31 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2004 of amazoncom inc and our report dated february 24 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

selection 

  

to provide the widest possible selection for our customers we have designed our websites to enable millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across many product categories 

  

amazoncom retail 

  

we sell a broad range of products that we purchase from manufacturers and distributors and deliver to our customers additionally through our syndicated stores program we utilize our ecommerce services features and technologies to sell our products through other businesses’ websites under our syndicated stores arrangements we generally own the inventory set prices and are responsible for fulfillment and customer service and the other business earns a sales commission on product sales 

  

thirdparty sellers 

  

we offer amazon marketplace and merchants programs that enable third parties to integrate their products on our websites allow customers to shop for products owned by third parties using our features and technologies and allow individuals to complete transactions that include multiple sellers in a single checkout process we are not the seller of record in these thirdparty seller transactions but instead earn fixed fees sales commissions perunit activity fees or some combination thereof 

  

amazon marketplace generally serves individuals and small businesses enabling them to offer their products for sale on our websites alongside our products or products made available by other thirdparty sellers our merchants program generally serves larger companies and is primarily concentrated on expanding the selection of new products available on our websites we also sometimes offer fulfillmentrelated services under our merchants program

competition 

  

the environment for our products and services is intensely competitive our current and potential competitors include 1 physicalworld retailers catalog retailers publishers distributors and manufacturers of our products many of which possess significant brand awareness sales volume and customer bases and some of which currently sell or may sell products or services through the internet mail order or direct marketing 2 other online ecommerce sites 3 a number of indirect competitors including media companies web portals and web search engines that are involved in online commerce either directly or in collaboration with other retailers and 4 companies that provide ecommerce services including website developers and thirdparty fulfillment and customerservice providers we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market segments include selection price availability convenience information discovery brand recognition personalized services accessibility customer service reliability speed of fulfillment ease of use and ability to adapt to changing conditions as well as our customers’ overall trust in the entire experience in transactions with us or facilitated by us on behalf of thirdparty sellers for services we offer to business and individual sellers additional competitive factors include the quality of our services and tools and the speed of performance for our services as the market segments in which we operate continue to grow other companies may also enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions

seasonality 

  

our business is affected by seasonality which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter 

  

employees 

  

we employed approximately 7800 fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2003 however employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business we also employ independent contractors and temporary personnel on a seasonal basis none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract hire and retain qualified personnel 

  

available information 

  

our investor relations website is wwwamazoncomir  we make available on this website under “financial documents” free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the us securities and exchange commission “sec” 

  

additional factors that may affect future results 

  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  

we have an accumulated deficit and may incur additional losses 

  

we have incurred significant net losses since we began doing business as of december 31 2003 we had an accumulated deficit of 297 billion and our stockholders’ equity was a deficit of 104 billion we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and although we earned a small amount of net income in 2003 we may incur losses again in the future 

  

we have significant indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had longterm indebtedness of 195 billion we make annual or semiannual interest payments on the indebtedness under our two convertible notes which are due in 2009 and 2010 although we made debt principal reduction payments in 2003 we may incur substantial additional debt in the future our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or other purposes in the future as needed to plan for or react to changes in technology and in our business and competition and to react in the event of an economic downturn 

  

there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments or if we fail to comply with covenants in our indebtedness we will be in default 

  

see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 17—subsequent events” 

  

we face intense competition 

  

the market segments in which we compete are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including both the retail and ecommerce services industries 

  

many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we have they may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies competitors in both the retail and ecommerce services industries also may be able to devote more resources to technology development and marketing than we do 

  

competition in the ecommerce channel may intensify other companies in the retail and ecommerce service industries may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions as various internet market segments obtain large loyal customer bases participants in those segments may expand into the market segments in which we operate in addition new and expanded web technologies may further intensify the competitive nature of online retail the nature of the internet as an electronic marketplace facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders it inherently more competitive than conventional retailing formats this increased competition may reduce our sales operating profits or both 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships 

  

we may enter into commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships with other companies we have entered into agreements to provide ecommerce services to other businesses and we plan to 

  

enter into similar agreements in the future including as part of our merchants syndicated stores and merchantcom initiatives under such agreements we may perform services such as providing our technology services such as search browse and personalization permitting other businesses and individuals to offer products or services through our websites and powering thirdparty websites either with or without providing accompanying fulfillment services these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may constrain the number of such agreements we are able to enter into and may affect our ability to integrate and deliver services under the relevant agreements if we fail to implement maintain and develop successfully the various components of such commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of third party software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is dependent on the volume of sales that the other company makes therefore if the other business’s website or product or services offering is not successful we may not receive all of the compensation we are otherwise due under the agreement or may not be able to maintain the agreement moreover we may not be able to succeed in our plans to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms 

  

as our commercial agreements expire or otherwise terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of our commercial agreements or both some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as such agreements expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services in addition several past commercial agreements were with companies that experienced business failures and were unable to meet their obligations to us we may in the future enter into further amendments of these agreements or encounter other parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

our present and future thirdparty services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as 

  

   

   

   

   

our present and future acquisitions business combinations joint ventures and investments create additional risks such as 

  

   

   

   

   

our investments and the consideration we receive under certain commercial agreements may subject us to a number of risks 

  

in the past we have entered into commercial agreements with other companies including strategic alliances whereby we perform certain ecommerce services and in exchange for our services we received cash equity securities of these companies andor additional benefits such as website traffic the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is dependent on the volume of sales made by the other company in 

  

some cases we have also made separate investments in the other company by making a cash payment in exchange for equity securities of that company we may make similar investments in the future to the extent we have received equity securities as compensation fluctuations in the value of such securities will affect our ultimate realization of amounts we have received as compensation for services 

  

in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of our commercial agreements or both we may in the future enter into further amendments of our commercial agreements although these amendments did not affect the amount of unearned revenue previously recorded by us if any the timing of revenue recognition of these recorded unearned amounts has been changed to correspond with the terms of the amended agreements to the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable as future amounts are subsequently received such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement 

  

our investments in equity securities are included in “marketable securities” and “other equity investments” on our consolidated balance sheets we regularly review all of our investments in public and private companies for otherthantemporary declines in fair value when we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment below our accounting basis is otherthantemporary we reduce the carrying value of the securities we hold and record a loss in the amount of any such decline in recent years securities of companies in the internet and ecommerce industries have experienced significant difficulties we may conclude in future quarters that the fair values of our investments have experienced additional otherthantemporary declines as of december 31 2003 our recorded basis in equity securities was 23 million including 9 million classified as “marketable securities” and 15 million classified as “other equity investments” 

  

the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations 

  

we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to be realized during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year if we do not stock popular products in sufficient amounts or fail to have sources to timely restock popular products such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits a failure to optimize inventory in our us fulfillment network will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make longzone shipments or partial shipments from one or more locations orders from each of our internationally focused websites are fulfilled primarily from a single fulfillment center and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we may experience a decline in our shipping margins due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery especially for the holiday season if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday or other demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers during these peak periods and third parties that provide fulfillment services to our customers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand finally we along with our customer service cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff customer service centers 

  

we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable our accounts payable balance will decline during the first three months following yearend which will result in a decline in the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand 

  

we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth 

  

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future net sales and rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our net sales fall short of our expectations 

  

our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions throughout the world a softening of demand whether caused by changes in consumer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth terrorist attacks and armed hostilities create economic and consumer uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue or growth such events could create delays in and increase the cost of product shipments which may decrease demand revenue growth may not be sustainable and our companywide percentage growth rate may decrease in the future 

  

our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

finally both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality are likely to affect our business internet usage generally slows during the summer months and sales in almost all of our product groups particularly toys and electronics usually increase significantly in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 

  

we have foreign exchange risk 

  

the results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant transaction gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances 

  

in addition our 6875 convertible subordinated notes due 2010 “6875 peacs” are denominated in euros not us dollars we remeasure the principal of the 6875 peacs quarterly based on fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange ratio and record gains or losses in “remeasurement of 6875 peacs and other” on our consolidated statements of operations furthermore we hold cash equivalents and marketable securities in euros british pounds and yen accordingly if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

  

our planned future growth will place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources 

  

we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and will endeavor to expand further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings and customer base such growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources we also need to hire train and manage our employee base our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth 

  

in addition we do not expect to benefit in our newer market segments from the firsttomarket advantage that we experienced in the online book channel our gross profits in our newer business activities may be lower than in our older business activities in addition we may have limited or no experience in new product and service activities and our customers may not favorably receive our new businesses to the extent we pursue commercial agreements andor strategic alliances to facilitate new product or service activities the agreements andor alliances may not be successful if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation and negatively affect revenue growth 

  

the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business 

  

we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president chief executive officer and chairman of the board we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

  

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales 

  

customer access to our websites directly affects the volume of goods we sell and the services we offer and thus affects our net sales we experience occasional system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add additional software and hardware and upgrade in an effective manner our systems and network infrastructure it could cause system interruption and adversely affect our operating results 

  

our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders 

  

should this occur it would make our product offerings less attractive to our customers and our service offerings less attractive to third parties while we do have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

  

we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments 

  

we plan over time to continue to expand our reach in international market segments we have relatively little experience in purchasing marketing and distributing products or services for these market segments and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages it is costly to establish international facilities and operations promote our brand internationally and develop localized websites stores and other systems we may not succeed in these efforts our net sales from international market segments may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining the related operations and therefore these operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis 

  

our international sales and related operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling abroad including but not limited to risks with respect to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as the international ecommerce channel continues to grow competition will likely intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand name recognition in addition governments in foreign jurisdictions may regulate ecommerce or other online services in such areas as content privacy network security copyright encryption taxation or distribution we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth in international market segments 

  

we face significant inventory risk 

  

we are exposed to significant inventory risks as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products in order to be successful we must accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling a new product it is particularly difficult to forecast product demand accurately a failure to optimize inventory within our fulfillment network will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make split shipments from one or more locations complimentary upgrades and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery as a result of our merchants program relationships with toysruscom babiesruscom target and other companies these parties identify buy manage and bear the financial risk of inventory obsolescence for their corresponding stores and merchandise as a result if any of these parties fail to forecast product demand or optimize inventory we would receive reduced service fees under the agreements and our business and reputation could be harmed 

  

the acquisition of certain types of inventory or inventory from certain sources may require significant leadtime and prepayment and such inventory may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons 

  

any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

  

if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed 

  

if we do not successfully operate our fulfillment centers it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand because it is difficult to predict demand we may not manage our facilities in an optimal way which may result in excess or insufficient inventory and warehousing fulfillment and distribution capacity a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make longzone shipments or partial shipments from one or more locations orders from each of our internationally focused websites are fulfilled primarily from a single fulfillment center and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers finally our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently or ship completed orders to customers may be negatively affected by a number of factors including dependence on a limited number of shipping companies inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism or acts of god 

  

third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies in our fulfillment centers thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory in and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability or failure of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

  

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties 

  

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers partners and others to protect our proprietary rights effective trademark service mark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available online 

  

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is inherently difficult and we may not be able to determine the existence or extent of any such unauthorized use the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our rights or that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights 

  

third parties that license our proprietary rights may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation in addition the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights trademarks trade dress patents and similar proprietary rights other parties may claim that we infringed their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the imposition of damages that we must pay we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements 

  

we have a limited operating history and our stock price is highly volatile 

  

we have a relatively short operating history and as an ecommerce company we have a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of these events may cause our stock price to rise or fall and may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities 

  

future volatility in our stock price could force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both in the first quarter of 2001 we offered a limited noncompulsory exchange of employee stock options this option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for certain of our stock options additionally all options granted on or after january 1 2003 are subject to variable accounting treatment variable accounting treatment will result in unpredictable stockbased compensation expense dependent on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock in late 2002 we implemented a restricted stock unit plan which will be our primary vehicle for stockbased compensation going forward restricted stock and restricted stock units not subject to variable accounting are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the common stock which will be recognized as compensation expense over the corresponding service term 

  

government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

  

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services these regulations and laws may cover taxation user privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection the provision of online payment services broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership sales and other taxes libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business in addition many jurisdictions currently regulate “auctions” and “auctioneers” and may regulate online auction services jurisdictions may also regulate other consumertoconsumer online markets including certain aspects of amazon marketplace this could in turn diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

  

we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease 

  

in accordance with current industry practice we do not collect sales taxes or other taxes with respect to shipments of most of our goods into states other than washington north dakota and in april 2004 kansas under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record of the applicable merchandise and we are obligated to collect sales tax in most states in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional strategic alliances requiring similar tax collection obligations we collect value added tax or vat for products that are ordered on wwwamazoncouk wwwamazonde and wwwamazonfr and delivered in european union or eu member countries as of july 1 2003 we began collecting vat with respect to certain of our “electronically supplied services” including digital downloads and marketplace services provided to certain eu residents we also collect japanese consumption tax for products that are ordered on wwwamazoncojp and delivered in japan in addition canadian consumption taxes are collected on sales of products that are ordered on wwwamazonca and delivered in canada our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of those networks along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on outofjurisdiction companies that engage in ecommerce a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 

  

currently decisions of the us supreme court restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering various initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court’s 

  

position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives addressed the supreme court’s constitutional concerns and resulted in a reversal of its current position we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in states other than washington north dakota and kansas the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us and could decrease our future sales 

  

we source a significant portion of our inventory from a few vendors 

  

although we continue to increase our direct purchasing from manufacturers we source a significant amount of inventory from relatively few vendors however no vendor accounts for 10 or more of our inventory purchases we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise to us on acceptable terms we may not be able to acquire merchandise from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms 

  

we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell 

  

some of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls certain businesses and individuals also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient resources to protect themselves from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our vendor agreements with our suppliers and third party sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 

  

we could be liable for breaches of security on our website and fraudulent activities of users of our payments program 

  

a fundamental requirement for ecommerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 

  

the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition we are aware that governmental agencies have investigated the provision of online payment services and could require changes in the way this business is conducted we guarantee payments made through our payments program available to sellers on marketplace and certain other programs up to certain limits for buyers and we may be unable to prevent users from fraudulently collecting payments when goods may not be shipped to a buyer as our payments program grows our liability risk will increase any costs we incur as a result of liability because of our payments program’s guarantee or otherwise could harm our business in addition the functionality of our payments program depends on certain thirdparty vendors delivering services if these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services our payments program and our businesses that use it may not be viable 

  

we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards 

  

technology in the ecommerce industry changes rapidly we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and preferences and industry standards competitors often introduce new products and services with new technologies these changes and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing websites and proprietary technology obsolete 

  

the internet as a medium for commerce is uncertain 

  

consumer use of the internet as a medium for commerce is a recent phenomenon and is subject to a high level of uncertainty while the number of internet users has been rising the internet infrastructure may not expand fast enough to meet the increased levels of demand if use of the internet as a medium for commerce does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our sales would be lower than expected and our business would be harmed 

  

we could be liable for unlawful or fraudulent activities by users of our merchants marketplace merchantcom and certain other programs 

  

we may be unable to prevent users of our merchants marketplace merchantcom and certain other programs from selling unlawful goods or from selling goods in an unlawful manner we may face civil or criminal liability for unlawful and fraudulent activities by our users under us laws and the laws and regulations of other countries in addition if we are unsuccessful in preventing our users from providing content that is either illegal or that violates the proprietary rights of others it may result in liability to us any costs we incur as a result of liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods the unlawful sale of goods the fraudulent receipt of goods or the fraudulent collection of payments could harm our business in running our merchants marketplace merchantcom and other programs we rely on sellers to make accurate representations and provide reliable delivery and on buyers to pay the agreed purchase price to the extent we expand our guarantee program this may create additional liability for us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

this section should be read in conjunction with “forwardlooking statements” below as well as item 1 of part 1 “business—additional factors that may affect future results” and item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

overview 

  

our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites  the products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors and manufacturers and products sold by third parties on our websites generally we recognize revenue as the seller of record from items we offer from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items offered by third parties 

  

our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flow 1  we also seek to minimize shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders 

  

free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing consolidated segment operating profit and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures increases in consolidated segment operating profit result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping costs low to increase sales we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability increasing selection expanding product information improving ease of use and earning customer trust our price reductions take several forms we reduce the sales prices of products we sell we recruit thirdparty sellers to compete with us on product detail pages and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer 

  

we moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002 restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement however we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees total shares outstanding plus employee stock awards are essentially unchanged at the end of 2003 compared to 2002 

  

we leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable cost per unit our customer experience costs specifically the costs necessary to build enhance and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers are largely fixed costs the customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs creditcard processing fees picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support and certain aspects of our marketing costs we focus on maintaining a lean culture by reducing defects in our processes and obtaining volume discounts from suppliers to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers 

  

because we are able to turn our inventory quickly we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow 2  on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover 3 was 18 19 and 16 for 2003 2002 and 2001 we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our continuing focus on instock inventory availability our future investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers accounts payable days 4 were 50 52 and 49 at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of suppliers and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms 

  

our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites  we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase the ubiquity of computers in people’s lives  our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 

  

      

finally we want to emphasize that we do not believe that our reported net income for the year ended december 31 2003 should be viewed as a material positive event or should be considered predictive of future results as we discuss in item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies—foreign currencies” had it not been for our decision to settle intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies we would have reported a small net loss for 2003 also as our financial reporting currency is the us dollar our total revenue profit and free cash flow has significantly benefited each of the past two years from weakness in the us dollar in comparison to the currencies of our fastergrowing international websites while we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our fast growing international businesses benefits our shareholders it is important to evaluate our growth rates after the effect of currency changes for example although we grew 34 during 2003 holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 28 in the future this trend may reverse and our consolidated us dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our localcurrency growth rates 

  

for a description of and additional information about each line item summarized below refer to item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others the rate of growth of the economy in general and of the internet and online commerce customer spending patterns world events the amount that we invest in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services competition risks of inventory management the degree to which we enter into commercial agreements and strategic transactions and maintain and develop commercial relationships foreign exchange risks seasonality international growth and expansion and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1 of part i “business—additional factors that may affect future results” which along with the following discussion describes some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations 

  

critical accounting judgments 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

significant accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred to the carrier or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured additionally revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria 1 the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis 2 there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items and 3 delivery of any undelivered item is probable 

  

we evaluate the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions when we are the primary obligor in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not the primary obligor and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we record the net amounts as commissions earned 

  

product sales net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier return allowances which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns are estimated using historical experience 

  

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction while inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in “net sales” 

  

commissions and perunit fees received from thirdparty sellers and amounts earned through our merchantcom program are recognized when the item is sold by the thirdparty seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured we record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience we also record an allowance using historical experience for losses we incur on our payment guarantee from disputes by customers against thirdparty sellers 

  

inventories 

  

inventories consisting of products available for sale are accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category based on this evaluation we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value 

  

currency effect on intercompany balances 

  

a provision of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 52 foreign currency translation  requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered 

  

longterm investments where settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future be excluded in the determination of net income our international operations are financed in part by the us parent company currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were historically recorded to equity as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts during the fourth quarter of 2003 we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and accordingly upon consolidation any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurement of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net income the effect for the fourth quarter of 2003 and the year ended december 31 2003 was to increase net income by 36 million the effect of this treatment was very significant to our net income for the year and for the quarter had we not changed our intent as to the settlement of these intercompany balances we would have had a net loss for 2003 and our net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 would have been reduced by almost 50 see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—remeasurement of 6875 peacs and other” for further discussion 

  

restructuring estimates 

  

restructuringrelated liabilities include estimates for among other things anticipated disposition of lease obligations key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated timing of sublease rentals estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs and estimates for brokerage and other related costs additionally we may determine that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring which we have been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions may be necessary for our future expansion needs we periodically evaluate and if necessary adjust our estimates based on currentlyavailable information if we elect to utilize this office space in accordance with sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we will adjust our restructuringrelated liability and classify future payments to “general and administrative” on the consolidated statements of operations

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which were 140 billion 130 billion and 997 million at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 additionally we received cash from exercises of employee stock awards of 163 million 122 million and 15 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 we expect that stock award exercises will decline as a source of cash as a result of our decision to use restricted stock unit awards as our primary form of stockbased compensation at december 31 2003 and 2002 we held 764 million and 398 million in foreign currencies primarily euros british pounds and yen 

  

during 2003 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were utilized to redeem our 10 senior discount notes due 2008 “10 senior discount notes” and a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2009 “475 convertible subordinated notes” total redemption payments including redemption premiums totaled 483 million see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and other” 

  

our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers and thirdparty sellers offset by cash payments we make to suppliers of products and services employee compensation and interest payments on our longterm debt obligations cash received from customers and thirdparty sellers generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels we generally experience a net cash outflow during the first quarter of each year as we pay suppliers for inventory that was purchased and sold in the fourth quarter at the end of 2003 we held 294 million of products in inventories an increase of 91 million in comparison to the prior year the increase in inventories corresponds with our efforts to add product categories increase selection and availability in both existing and new product categories take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers and the effect of foreign exchange rates additionally our 

  

accounts payable at december 31 2003 increased 202 million over the prior year end corresponding with increased sales volume 

  

since our 6875 peacs which are due in 2010 are denominated in euros our us dollar equivalent interest payments fluctuate with the euro to us dollar exchange rate in 2003 the us dollar weakened considerably relative to the euro resulting in higher us dollar equivalent interest payments additionally in 2003 we began accruing interest on our 10 senior discount notes and paid 2 million of interest when we repaid the full principal amount we also made interest payments of 3 million associated with the 200 million partial redemption of our 475 convertible subordinated notes this payment was otherwise scheduled to be paid in 2004 we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency effects on our interest payments relating to the 6875 peacs and as a result any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and other” 

  

cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with our buying and selling of marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software costs cash provided by investing activities was 237 million during 2003 while cash used in investing activities was 122 million and 253 million during 2002 and 2001 our capital expenditures were 46 million 39 million and 50 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 we believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition 

  

cash provided by used in financing activities consists primarily of cash proceeds from exercises of stock options repayment of longterm debt and repayment of capital lease obligations cash used in financing activities was 332 million during 2003 resulting primarily from repayments of longterm debt obligations cash provided by financing activities was 107 million during 2002 and 2001 we expect cash proceeds from exercises of employee stock options to decline over time as we plan to continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for employee stockbased awards 

  

in january 2004 our board of directors authorized a debt repurchase program pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase through open market repurchases or private transactions redeem or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of 500 million of our outstanding 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6875 peacs in addition to this debt repurchase program on february 26 2004 we will redeem 150 million of our 475 convertible subordinated notes 

  

the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december 31 2003 in thousands 

  

    

      

we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part i “business—additional factors that may affect future results” we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities from lenders repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position and our board of directors has authorized the debt repurchase program discussed above the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities we do not currently have a lineofcredit and there can be no assurance that linesofcredit or other financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

results of operations 

  

segment operating income loss 

  

   

the key drivers in the yearoveryear improvement in segment operating income are revenue growth and efficiencies in our fulfillment process revenue growth was driven in part by lowering prices including increased adoption by our customers of our free shipping offers operating expenses in our north america and international segments increased 22 million and 61 million or 4 and 24 in 2003 in comparison to the prior year the increases in segment operating expenses were primarily related to variable costs including fulfillmentrelated costs for picking packaging and shipping our products to customers and credit card fees offset by reductions in most other expense categories segment operating expenses represented 18 and 16 of net sales for north america and international segments compared with 20 and 21 in the prior year the yearoveryear 

  

declines in segment operating expenses as a percentage of net sales result from leveraging the fixed cost portion of our operations over increased volume see “net sales and gross profit” below for additional information about increases in our sales volume 

  

in 2002 improvements in our income loss from operations over the prior year were also significantly affected by the decline in amortization charges primarily relating to the required adoption of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  and lower restructuringrelated charges 

  

net sales and gross profit 

  

net sales information is as follows in thousands 

  

   

revenue growth is due to increased demand which was driven by increased selection lower prices including from our free shipping offers and improved features and services available on our websites including 

  

our amazon marketplace and merchant programs revenues improved 232 million and 47 million in 2003 and 2002 in comparison to the preceding years due to changes in foreign exchange rates as the us dollar weakened the future growth of our international segment measured in us dollars may fluctuate significantly with changes in foreign exchange rates see item 1 of part i “business—additional factors that may affect future results—we have foreign exchange risk” we also anticipate that as the revenue base of our international segment increases the percentage growth rates in local currency will likely decline over time 

  

sales of products by thirdparty sellers on our websites continue to increase since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount they result in lower revenues but higher gross margins per unit as there are no associated costs classified within cost of sales unless we perform fulfillment services to the extent product sales by thirdparty sellers continue to increase we anticipate improvement in gross margin offset to the extent we offer additional or broader price reductions free shipping offers and other promotions 

  

gross profit is as follows in thousands 

  

   

the increases in gross profit in comparison with the prior years corresponds with increased revenue offset by our yearround free shipping offers and lower prices for customers generally our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including our mix of sales during the year sales volumes by thirdparty sellers competitive pricing decisions changes in vendor pricing and general efforts to reduce prices for our customers over time as well as the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping offers these free shipping offers reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and reduce our gross margins on retail sales in particular we commenced offering free super saver delivery in the uk in 2003 and this decision decreased the gross margins for our international segment we view our shipping offers as an effective marketing tool and intend to continue offering them gross profit in 2003 benefited 46 million in comparison to 2002 due to changes in foreign exchange rates as the us dollar weakened 

  

supplemental information about shipping results is as follows in thousands 

  

   

we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success one way we offer lower prices is through freeshipping alternatives that result in a net cost to us in delivering products we seek to 

  

offset these costs over time through achieving higher sales volumes and better operating efficiencies and by negotiating better terms with our suppliers 

  

fulfillment 

  

fulfillment costs were 477 million 392 million and 374 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 representing 9 10 and 12 of net sales the increase in fulfillment costs in comparison with the prior year primarily relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and our mix of product sales the mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of our products the improvement in fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales results from improvements in productivity and accuracy the increase in units fulfilled which leverages the fixedcost portion of our fulfillment network efficiencies gained through utilization of fulfillment services provided by third parties a decline in customer service contacts per order resulting from improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features available on our websites these improvements were offset in part by credit card fees associated with thirdparty seller transactions which represent a significant percentage relative to commission amounts earned and as a result negatively affect fulfillment as a percentage of net sales 

  

marketing 

  

marketing expenses net of cooperative marketing reimbursements were 123 million 125 million and 138 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 representing 2 3 and 4 of net sales although we do not expect them to do so if cooperative marketing reimbursements decline in future periods we may incur additional expenses to continue certain promotions or elect to reduce or discontinue them 

  

we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of online marketing channels including our syndicated stores and associates programs which enable associated websites to make our products available to their audiences with fulfillment performed by us under these arrangements we pay a sales commission on product sales which is classified as “marketing” on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

declines in expense for marketingrelated activities reflect management efforts to cut ineffective marketing programs as well as reduced rates charged to us for some online marketing activities these decreases are partially offset by increased investment in marketing channels considered most effective in driving incremental net sales such as targeted online advertising through various web portals and our associates program we expect absolute dollars spent in marketing to increase in 2004 

  

technology and content 

  

technology and content expenses were 208 million 216 million and 241 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 representing 4 5 and 8 of net sales the decline in absolute dollars spent for 2003 primarily reflects improved expense management and general price reductions in most expense categories offset by increases in employeerelated costs the decline in absolute dollars spent for 2002 primarily reflects our migration to a technology platform that utilizes a lesscostly technology infrastructure we expect absolute dollars spent in technology and content to increase during 2004 as we continue to hire more computer scientists and software engineers however as a percentage of net sales we expect these costs to remain flat or possibly decline 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses were 88 million 79 million and 90 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 representing 2 of net sales for 2003 and 2002 and 3 of net sales for 2001 we generally expect administrative costs to increase over time commensurate with the increasing size and complexity of our business in 2004 we expect ongoing general and administrative costs to increase in absolute terms however as a percentage of net sales we expect these costs to remain flat or possibly decline 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

stockbased compensation was 88 million 69 million and 5 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 in late 2002 we began issuing restricted stock units as our primary form of stockbased compensation previously we primarily issued atthemoney stock options in certain of our foreign jurisdictions we continue to grant stock options 

  

at december 31 2003 we had 30 million stock awards outstanding including 25 million stock options which had a weighted average exercise price of 1246 4 million restricted stock units and 1 million shares of restricted stock common shares outstanding which includes restricted stock plus shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units totaled 433 million at december 31 2003 flat with the prior year for additional information about our stockbased compensation and awards see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” and “—note 8—stockholders’ deficit” 

  

amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 

  

amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was 3 million 5 million and 181 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance with gaap and based on the current balance of intangibles absent any additional investment amortization of intangibles will not be significant going forward 

  

restructuringrelated and other 

  

cash payments resulting from our january 2001 operational restructuring were 26 million and 45 million for 2003 and 2002 based on currently available information we estimate the remaining restructuringrelated cash outflows will be as follows in thousands 

  

    

for additional information about our january 2001 operational restructuring see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 10—restructuringrelated and other” 

  

net interest expense 

  

we generally invest our excess cash in arated or higher shorttointermediateterm fixed income securities and money market mutual funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them the primary components of our interest expense relate to our debt instruments during 2003 we redeemed our 10 senior discount notes and we redeemed a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes at december 31 2003 our total longterm indebtedness was 195 billion see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and other” and “—note 17—subsequent events” 

  

other income expense net 

  

other income expense net was a gain of 3 million and 6 million for 2003 and 2002 and a loss of 2 million in 2001 these amounts consist of gains on sales of marketable securities state foreign and other taxes and miscellaneous nonoperating gains and losses see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 11—other income expense net” for additional information 

  

remeasurement of 6875 peacs and other 

  

remeasurement of 6875 peacs and other consisted of the following in thousands 

  

       

income taxes 

  

subject to certain limitations we have approximately 29 billion of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire at various times starting in 2010 approximately 16 billion of our net operating loss carryforwards relates to tax deductible stockbased compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes to the extent that net operating loss carryforwards if realized relate to stockbased compensation the resulting tax benefits will be recorded to stockholders’ equity rather than to results of operations see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 13—income taxes” for additional information 

  

net income loss 

  

although we reported net income for the year ended 2003 we believe that this net income result should not be viewed as a material positive event and is not necessarily predictive of future reported results for a variety of reasons for example had we not changed our intent as to the settlement of the intercompany balances during the fourth quarter we would have had a small net loss for the year and our net income for the fourth quarter would have been reduced by almost 50 additionally we are unable to forecast the effect on our future reported results of certain items including the stockbased compensation associated with variable accounting treatment and the gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs and intercompany balances that results from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these items represented significant quarterly charges and gains during 2003 and may result in significant charges or gains in future periods 

  

unearned revenue 

  

unearned revenue was 38 million and 48 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 unearned revenue represents payments received by us in advance of our service obligations as we continue to structure our agreements to align the timing of our cash receipts with the service provided we expect that over time balances of unearned revenue may continue to decline we believe this trend in unearned revenue is not significant relative to the trend in our cash flows or operating results see “net sales and gross profit” above 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

regulation g “conditions for use of nongaap financial measures” and other provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 “1934 act” define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nongaap financial information we believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a nongaap financial measure are important supplemental information to investors we provide “consolidated segment operating income loss” “pro forma net income loss” “pro forma net earnings loss per share” and “free cash flow” 

  

we use these nongaap financial measures for internal managerial purposes when publicly providing guidance on possible future results and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons these nongaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 

  

because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names for example certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest taxes depreciation and amortization commonly referred to as ebitda we considered the use of ebitda as a supplemental performance measure to gaap but believe consolidated segment operating income loss and pro forma net income loss are superior for our company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs and certain costs associated with our capital structure such as interest expense are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions for information about our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data” for a quantitative reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures see “reconciliation tables” below 

  

consolidated segment operating income loss 

  

we measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes 

  

   

   

   

these operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results and all other centrallyincurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results the sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income loss which we reconcile to gaap operating income loss pursuant to sec staff interpretations of regulation g when presented in our financial statement footnotes consolidated segment 

  

operating income is a gaap financial measure however since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes we have included this financial measure in our discussion of nongaap financial measures 

  

we use consolidated segment operating income loss and ratios based on it to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance our management evaluates consolidated segment income loss because it excludes certain cash and noncash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded or both 

  

items excluded from consolidated segment operating income loss 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we exclude stockbased compensation for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

we record the employer portion of payroll tax expense a cash expense resulting from exercises of stockbased awards in “fulfillment” “marketing” “technology and content” and “general and administrative” on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in “stockbased compensation” 

  

amortization of other intangibles 

  

we exclude “amortization of other intangibles” for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

restructuringrelated and other 

  

we exclude restructuringrelated and other expenses which are cash and noncash amounts for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

impairment of goodwill 

  

if in the future we incur impairment losses on our goodwill such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income loss since they would be noncash and not in the immediate control of management we have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter of each year no indicators of impairment were identified during the year ended december 31 2003 

  

limitations of consolidated segment operating income loss 

  

consolidated segment operating income loss has certain limitations first because it excludes “stockbased compensation” the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce we compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stockbased compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements we also provide supplemental information about outstanding stockbased awards including their dilutive effect on shareholders in the footnotes to our financial statements see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—description of business and accounting policies” for presentation of our stockbased compensation expense calculated on a consistent basis for all awards using the fair value method as prescribed under sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  as well as total outstanding stockbased awards and related activity 

  

second consolidated segment operating income loss excludes “restructuringrelated and other” for companies that periodically undergo restructuring events excluding such costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows however we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures including operating cash flow that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our january 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—restructuringrelated and other” there can be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows if we have a restructuring event in the future we will reevaluate our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income loss based on those future facts and circumstances at that time 

  

pro forma net income loss 

  

pro forma net income loss including the related pro forma net earnings loss per share which we reconcile to net income loss and net earnings loss per share excludes in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income loss the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

   

   

   

we use pro forma net income loss and ratios based on it to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance our decision to use this financial measure is due to the fact that pro forma net income loss excludes certain cash and noncash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded or both 

  

items excluded from pro forma net income loss 

  

see “consolidated segment operating income loss—items excluded from consolidated segment operating income loss” for an explanation of “stockbased compensation” “amortization of other intangibles” “restructuringrelated and other” and “impairment of goodwill” 

  

remeasurement of 6875 peacs and other 

  

the majority of “remeasurement of 6875 peacs and other” consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6875 peacs from euros to us dollars we exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income loss because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain these gains or charges would only affect nearterm cash flows if we redeem or in certain cases restructure our 6875 peacs in the next several years rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010 because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the us dollar and euro these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods 

  

additionally we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreigncurrency denominated intercompany balances we exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods 

  

this line item also includes 24 million of losses associated with the redemption of our 10 senior discount notes and a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes and 6 million of losses associated with the termination of our euro currency swap 

  

equity in losses of equitymethod investees net 

  

we exclude equity in losses of equitymethod investees net because it generates potential noncash gains or losses which are based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict in addition we believe these noncash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance finally in recent quarters these amounts represented insignificant charges and absent future investments we expect this trend to continue 

  

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

  

we exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates noncash charges which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance 

  

limitations of pro forma net income loss 

  

pro forma net income loss has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income see “consolidated segment operating income loss—limitations of consolidated segment operating income loss” above in addition when the 6875 peacs are retired whether by early redemption or restructuring or at maturity in 2010 the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the us dollar and the euro will result in a cash effect we compensate for this limitation by disclosing the effect of currency movements on our 6875 peacs on our consolidated statements of operations and presenting the fair value of our 6875 peacs in the notes to our financial statements see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and other” 

  

free cash flow 

  

free cash flow which we reconcile to “net cash provided by used in operating activities” is cash flow from operations reduced by “purchases of fixed assets including internaluse software and website development” we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations in limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations however since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows 

  

limitations of free cash flow 

  

free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

full year and corresponding quarterly consolidated segment operating income and certain cash flow information for 2003 2002 and 2001 were as follows in thousands 

  

   

the following is a reconciliation of our nongaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures for 2003 2002 and 2001 quarterly reconciliations are consistent with fullyear presentation 

  

   

     

guidance 

  

first quarter of 2004 net sales are expected to be between 139 billion and 149 billion or grow between 28 and 38 for the full year 2004 net sales are expected to be between 620 billion and 670 billion however any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part i “business—additional factors that may affect future results” 

  

assuming among other things and solely for purposes of this estimate that we do not record any revisions to our restructuringrelated estimates and that the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2004 and december 31 2004 is identical to the closing price of 5262 on december 31 2003 operating income for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be between 80 million and 100 million and for the full year of 2004 to be between 355 million and 455 million however any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part i “ business—additional factors that may affect future results” in addition our gaap operating projections are based on an assumption about our future stock price performance which is required to estimate stockbased compensation and is difficult to accurately predict 

  

first quarter of 2004 consolidated segment operating income is expected to be between 95 million and 115 million for the full year 2004 consolidated segment operating income is expected to be between 430 million and 530 million however any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part i “business—additional factors that may affect future results” 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments 

  

information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as availableforsale and accordingly are presented at fair value on our balance sheets we generally invest our excess cash in arated or higher short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and money market mutual funds fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 

  

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2003 amounts were as follows in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at december 31 2002 amounts are as follows in thousands except percentages 

  

   

at december 31 2003 we have longterm debt of 195 billion primarily associated with our 6875 peacs and 475 convertible subordinated notes which are due in 2010 and 2009 our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of periodic interest payments and principal payments at maturity the market value of our longterm debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest based upon quoted market prices the fair value of the 6875 peacs was 870 million and 531 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 and the fair value of the 475 convertible subordinated notes was 106 billion principal balance of 105 billion and 925 million principal balance of 125 billion at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

foreign exchange risk 

  

during 2003 net sales from our international segment consisting of wwwamazoncouk wwwamazonde wwwamazonfr and wwwamazoncojp  accounted for 38 of our consolidated revenues net sales and related expenses generated from these websites as well as those relating to wwwamazonca  are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and include euros british pounds yen and canadian dollars the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency the results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationallyfocused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant transaction gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2003 international segment revenues improved 226 million and our operating results improved 15 million in comparison with the prior year 

  

we have foreign exchange risk related to foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities “foreign funds” based on the balance of foreign funds at december 31 2003 of 764 million an assumed 5 10 and 20 negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of 38 million 76 million and 153 million all investments are classified as “available for sale” as defined by sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 

  

we have foreign exchange risk related to our 6875 peacs which have an outstanding principal balance of 690 million euros 870 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2003 based on the outstanding 6875 peacs’s principal balance an assumed 5 10 and 20 weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro would result in losses of approximately 43 million 87 million and 174 million recorded to “remeasurement of 6875 peacs and other” we are not hedged on interest payments under our 6875 peacs assuming the us dollar weakens against the euro by 5 10 and 15 in 2004 we would incur 2 million 4 million and 6 million additional interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange 

  

investment risk 

  

as of december 31 2003 our recorded basis in equity securities was 23 million including 9 million classified as “marketable securities” and 15 million classified as “other equity investments” we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are otherthantemporary during 2003 we recorded impairment losses totaling 2 million compared to 8 million during the year ended december 31 2002 to writedown several of our equity securities to fair value the fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions based on the fair value of the publiclytraded equity securities we held at december 31 2003 of 86 million recorded basis of 16 million an assumed 15 30 and 50 adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately 13 million 26 million and 43 million

merchandise to customers on a reliable and timely basis in addition we fulfill certain orders through outsourced fulfillment providers seasonality   our business is generally affected by both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage which generally declines during summer months and traditional retail seasonality traditional retail sales for most of our products including books music dvds videos toys and electronics among others usually increase significantly in the fourth calendar quarter of each year of particular note is the fourth quarter seasonal 4 effect on our sales of toys which are mainly sold through our merchants program relationship with toysruscom and electronics 

technology   we have implemented numerous website management search customer interaction recommendation transactionprocessing and fulfillment services and systems using a combination of our own proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies our current strategy is to focus our development efforts on creating and enhancing the specialized proprietary software that is unique to our business and to license or acquire commerciallydeveloped technology for other applications where available and appropriate   we use a set of applications for accepting and validating customer orders placing and tracking orders with suppliers managing and assigning inventory to customer orders and ensuring proper shipment of products to customers our transactionprocessing systems handle millions of items a number of different status inquiries giftwrapping requests and multiple shipment methods these systems allow the customer to choose whether to receive single or several shipments based on availability and to track the progress of each order these applications also manage the process of accepting authorizing and charging customer credit cards competition   the retail environment for our products is generally intensely competitive our current or potential competitors include 1 physicalworld retailers catalog retailers publishers distributors and manufacturers of our products many of which possess significant brand awareness sales volume and customer bases and some of which currently sell or may sell products or services through the internet mail order or direct marketing 2 other online ecommerce sites 3 a number of indirect competitors including web portals and web search engines that are involved in online commerce either directly or in collaboration with other retailers and 4 companies that provide ecommerce services including website developers and thirdparty fulfillment and customerservice providers we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market segments include selection price availability convenience information discovery brand recognition personalized services accessibility customer service reliability speed of fulfillment ease of use and ability to adapt to changing conditions for services we offer to business and individual sellers additional competitive factors include the quality of our services and tools and speed of performance for our services as the market segments in which we operate continue to grow other companies may also enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions intellectual property   we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law tradesecret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers partners and others to protect our proprietary rights we have registered a number of domain names and been issued a number of trademarks service marks patents and copyrights by us and foreign governmental authorities we also have applied for the registration of other trademarks service marks domain names and copyrights in the us and internationally and we have filed us and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology we have licensed in the past and expect that we may license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks patents technologies or copyrighted materials to third parties employees   we employed approximately 7500 fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2002 however employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business we also employ independent contractors and temporary personnel on a seasonal basis none of our employees is 5 represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense particularly for softwaredevelopment and other technical staff we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract hire and retain qualified personnel 

available information   our investor relations website is wwwamazoncomir  we make available on this website under “financial documents and annual reports” free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the us securities and exchange commission “sec” additional factors that may affect future results   the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 

   we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business as of december 31 2002 we had an accumulated deficit of 30 billion and our stockholders’ equity was a deficit of 14 billion we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and we may continue to incur such losses for the foreseeable future 

 

   as of december 31 2002 we had total longterm indebtedness under our 10 senior discount notes due 2008 “senior discount notes” convertible notes capitalizedlease obligations and other asset financings of 23 billion we make annual or semiannual interest payments on the indebtedness under our two tranches of convertible notes which are due in 2009 and 2010 respectively beginning in november 2003 we will begin to make semiannual interest payments on the indebtedness under our senior discount notes we may incur substantial additional debt in the future our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain necessary additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or other purposes in the future plan for or react to changes in technology and in our business and competition and react in the event of an economic downturn   there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments or if we fail to comply with covenants in our indebtedness we will be in default 

 

   the market segments in which we compete are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including both the retail and ecommerce services industries   many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we have they may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies competitors in both the retail and ecommerce services industries also may be able to devote more resources to technology development and marketing than us   competition in the ecommerce channel may intensify other companies in the retail and ecommerce service industries may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive 6 positions as various internet market segments obtain large loyal customer bases participants in those segments may expand into the market segments in which we operate in addition new and expanded web technologies may further intensify the competitive nature of online retail the nature of the internet as an electronic marketplace facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and renders it inherently more competitive than conventional retailing formats this increased competition may reduce our sales operating profits or both 

 

   we may enter into commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships with other companies we have entered into agreements to provide ecommerce services to other businesses and we plan to enter into similar agreements in the future under such agreements we may perform services such as providing our technology services such as search browse and personalization permitting other businesses and individuals to offer products or services through our web sites and powering thirdparty web sites either with or without providing accompanying fulfillment services these arrangements are complex and initially require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may constrain the number of such agreements we are able to enter into and may affect our ability to deliver services under the relevant agreements if we fail to implement maintain and develop successfully the various components of such arrangements which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing and licensing of third party software hardware and content these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is dependent on the volume of sales that the other company makes therefore if the other business’s web site or product or services offering is not successful we may not receive all of the compensation we are otherwise due under the agreement or may not be able to maintain the agreement moreover we may not be able to succeed in our plans to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms   as our commercial agreements expire or otherwise terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of our commercial agreements or both some of our agreements involve high margin services such as marketing and promotional agreements and as such agreements expire they may be replaced if at all by agreements involving lower margin services in addition several past commercial agreements were with companies that experienced business failures and were unable to meet their obligations to us we may in the future enter into further amendments of these agreements or encounter other parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results   in addition our present and future thirdparty services agreements other commercial agreements joint ventures investments and business combinations create risks such as  7 

 

   in the past we have entered into commercial agreements with other companies including strategic alliances where we perform certain ecommerce services and in exchange for our services we received cash equity securities of these companies andor additional benefits such as web site traffic the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is dependent on the volume of sales made by the other company in some cases we have also made separate investments in the other company by making a cash payment in exchange for equity securities of that company we may in the future make additional investments in companies with which we already have commercial agreements or companies with which we enter into new commercial agreements or similar arrangements to the extent we have received equity securities as compensation fluctuations in the value of such securities will affect our ultimate realization of amounts we have received as compensation for services   in the past we amended several of our commercial agreements to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us shorten the term of our commercial agreements or both we may in the future enter into further amendments of our commercial agreements although these amendments did not affect the amount of unearned revenue previously recorded by us if any the timing of revenue recognition of these recorded unearned amounts has been changed to correspond with the terms of the amended agreements to the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable as future amounts are subsequently received such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement   our investments in equity securities that are not accounted for under the equity method are included in “marketable securities” and “other equity investments” on our balance sheets we regularly review all of our investments in public and private companies for otherthantemporary declines in fair value when we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment below our accounting basis is otherthantemporary we reduce the carrying value of the securities we hold and record a loss in the amount of any such decline in recent years securities of companies in the internet and ecommerce industries have experienced significant difficulties we may conclude in future quarters that the fair values of other of these investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline as of december 31 2002 our recorded basis in equity securities was 19 million including 4 million classified as “marketable securities” and 15 million classified as “other equity investments” of which less than 1 million was accounted for under the equitymethod 

 

   we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to be realized during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year if we do not stock popular products in sufficient amounts and fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs which could reduce gross profits a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make partial shipments from one or more locations we may experience a decline in our shipping margins due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery especially for the holiday season if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers if too many customers access our web sites within a short period of time due to increased holiday or other demand we may experience system interruptions that make our web sites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers during these peak periods and third parties that provide fulfillment services to our customers may be unable to meet the 8 seasonal demand finally we along with our customer service outsourcers may be unable to adequately staff customer service centers 

  we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable our accounts payable balance will decline during the first three months following yearend which will result in a decline in the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand 

 

   due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future net sales and rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our net sales fall short of our expectations   our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions throughout the world a softening of demand whether caused by changes in consumer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth terrorist attacks and armed hostilities create economic and consumer uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue or growth such attacks and security concerns could create delays in and increase the cost of product shipments to and from us which may decrease demand revenue growth may not be sustainable and our companywide percentage growth rate may decrease in the future   our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including  9    finally both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality are likely to affect our business internet usage generally slows during the summer months and sales in almost all of our product groups particularly toys and electronics usually increase significantly in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 

 

   the results of operations of our internationallyfocused web sites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation as exchange rates vary net sales and other operating results when translated may differ materially from expectations   in addition our 6875 convertible subordinated notes due 2010 “6875 peacs” are denominated in euros not us dollars when we periodically remeasure the principal of the 6875 peacs based on fluctuations in the euro us dollar exchange ratio we will record noncash gains or losses in “other gains losses net” on our statements of operations furthermore we have invested some of the proceeds from the 6875 peacs in eurodenominated cash equivalents and marketable securities accordingly if the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa 

 

   we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and will endeavor to expand further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings and customer base such growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources we also need to train and manage our employee base our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth   in addition we do not expect to benefit in our newer market segments from the firsttomarket advantage that we experienced in the online book channel our gross profits in our newer business activities may be lower than in our older business activities in addition we may have limited or no experience in new product and service activities and our customers may not favorably receive our new businesses to the extent we pursue strategic alliances to facilitate new product or service activities the alliances may not be successful if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation and negatively affect revenue growth 

 

   we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president chief executive officer and chairman of the board we do not have “key person” life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 

 

   customer access to our web sites directly affects the volume of goods we sell and the services we offer and thus affects our net sales we experience occasional system interruptions that make our web sites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services to prevent system 10 interruptions we continually need to add additional software and hardware and upgrade our systems and network infrastructure to accommodate both increased traffic on our web sites and increased sales volume 

  our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders should this occur it would make our product offerings less attractive to our customers and our service offerings less attractive to third parties while we do have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 

 

   we plan over time to continue to expand our reach in international market segments we have relatively little experience in purchasing marketing and distributing products or services for these market segments and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages it is costly to establish international facilities and operations promote our brand internationally and develop localized web sites stores and other systems we may not succeed in these efforts our net sales from international market segments may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining the related operations and therefore these operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis   our international sales and related operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling abroad including but not limited to risks with respect to    as the international ecommerce channel continues to grow competition will likely intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and 11 focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand name recognition in addition governments in foreign jurisdictions may regulate ecommerce or other online services in such areas as content privacy network security copyright encryption taxation or distribution we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth in international market segments 

 

   we are exposed to significant inventory risks as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products in order to be successful we must accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling a new product it is particularly difficult to forecast product demand accurately a failure to optimize inventory within our fulfillment network will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make split shipments from one or more locations complimentary upgrades and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery as a result of our merchants program relationships with toysruscom babiesruscom target and other companies these parties identify buy manage and bear the financial risk of inventory obsolescence for their corresponding stores and merchandise as a result if any of these parties fail to forecast product demand or optimize inventory we would receive reduced service fees under the agreements and our business and reputation could be harmed   the acquisition of certain types of inventory or inventory from certain sources may require significant leadtime and prepayment and such inventory may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons   our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently or ship completed orders to customers may be negatively affected by a number of factors including dependence on a limited number of shipping companies inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism or acts of god   any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results 

 

   if we do not successfully operate our fulfillment centers it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand because it is difficult to predict sales volume we may not manage our facilities in an optimal way which may result in excess or insufficient inventory warehousing fulfillment and distribution capacity in addition third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers’ orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services finally under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies in our fulfillment centers thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory in and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability or failure of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation 

 

   we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers partners and others to protect our proprietary rights effective trademark service mark 12 copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available online 

  we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights   policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is inherently difficult and we may not be able to determine the existence or extent of any such unauthorized use the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our rights or that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights   third parties that license our proprietary rights may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation in addition the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights trademarks trade dress patents and similar proprietary rights other parties may claim that we infringed their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the imposition of damages that we must pay we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms which are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing ecommerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements 

 

   we have a relatively short operating history and as an ecommerce company we have a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors such as  13    any of these events may cause our stock price to rise or fall and may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities   future volatility in our stock price could force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both in the first quarter of 2001 we offered a limited noncompulsory exchange of employee stock options this option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for certain of our stock options variable accounting treatment will result in unpredictable stockbased compensation expense dependent on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock in late 2002 we implemented a restricted stock unit plan which will be our primary vehicle for employee stockbased compensation going forward restricted stock and restricted stock units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the common stock which will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the corresponding employee service term 

 

   we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services these regulations and laws may cover taxation user privacy pricing content copyrights distribution electronic contracts consumer protection the provision of online payment services broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership sales and other taxes libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business in addition many jurisdictions currently regulate “auctions” and “auctioneers” and may regulate online auction services jurisdictions may also regulate consumertoconsumer fixed price online markets like zshops and certain aspects of amazon marketplace this could in turn diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

 

   in accordance with current industry practice we do not collect sales taxes or other taxes with respect to shipments of most of our goods into states other than washington and north dakota under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record of the applicable merchandise and we are obligated to collect sales tax in most states in accordance with that company’s instructions we may enter into additional strategic alliances requiring similar tax collection obligations we collect value added tax or vat for products that are ordered on wwwamazoncouk wwwamazonde and wwwamazonfr and delivered in european union member countries we also collect japanese consumption tax for products that are ordered on wwwamazoncojp and delivered in japan in addition canadian consumption taxes are collected on sales of products that are ordered on wwwamazonca and delivered in canada our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of those networks along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on outofjurisdiction companies which engage in ecommerce a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business   currently decisions of the us supreme court restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering various initiatives that could limit or supersede the 14 supreme court’s position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives addressed the supreme court’s constitutional concerns and resulted in a reversal of its current position we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in states other than washington and north dakota the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us and could decrease our future sales 

  various countries are currently evaluating their vat positions on ecommerce transactions recently for example the european union “eu” enacted a directive requiring that businesses in noneu countries selling digital products and services to eu resident consumers collect and remit vat in the country of the consumer’s residence this directive will become effective on july 1 2003 will result in additional vat collection obligations and administrative burdens and may decrease our future sales to customers in the eu future vat legislation or changes to our business model may have similar impacts 

 

   although we continue to increase our direct purchasing from manufacturers we still source a significant amount of inventory from relatively few vendors during 2002 we purchased over 10 of all inventory purchases from a single vendor ingram book group no other vendors account for over 10 we do not have longterm contracts or arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise to us on acceptable terms we may not be able to acquire merchandise from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms 

 

   some of our products such as toys tools hardware computers cell phones and kitchen and houseware products may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls certain businesses and individuals also may sell products that may indirectly increase our exposure to product liability claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our vendor agreements with our suppliers do not indemnify us from product liability 

 

   a fundamental requirement for ecommerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results   the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition we are aware that governmental agencies have investigated the provision of online payment services and could require changes in the way this business is conducted we guarantee payments made through amazon payments up to certain limits for both buyers and sellers and we may be unable to prevent users of amazon payments from fraudulently receiving goods when payment may not be made to a seller or fraudulently collecting payments when goods may not be shipped to a buyer our liability risk will increase if a larger fraction of our sellers use amazon payments any costs we incur as a result of liability because of our guarantee of payments made through amazon payments or otherwise could harm our business in addition the functionality of amazon payments depends on certain thirdparty vendors delivering services if these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services amazon payments will not be viable and our businesses that use amazon payments may not be viable 15 

 

   technology in the ecommerce industry changes rapidly we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and preferences and industry standards competitors often introduce new products and services with new technologies these changes and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing web sites and proprietary technology obsolete 

 

   consumer use of the internet as a medium for commerce is a recent phenomenon and is subject to a high level of uncertainty while the number of internet users has been rising the internet infrastructure may not expand fast enough to meet the increased levels of demand if use of the internet as a medium for commerce does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our sales would be lower than expected and our business would be harmed 

 

   we may be unable to prevent users of our merchants program merchantcom program amazon marketplace auctions and zshops services from selling unlawful goods or from selling goods in an unlawful manner we may face civil or criminal liability for unlawful and fraudulent activities by our users under us laws andor the laws and regulations of other countries in addition if we are unsuccessful in preventing our users from providing content that is either illegal or which violates the proprietary rights of others it may result in liability to us any costs we incur as a result of liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods the unlawful sale of goods the fraudulent receipt of goods or the fraudulent collection of payments could harm our business in running our merchants program merchantcom program amazon marketplace auctions and zshops services we rely on sellers to make accurate representations and provide reliable delivery and on buyers to pay the agreed purchase price we do not take responsibility for delivery of payment or goods and while we can suspend or terminate the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations we cannot require users to make payments or deliver goods we do not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users except through our guarantee program under our guarantee program fraudulent activities by our users such as the fraudulent receipt of goods and the fraudulent collection of payments may create liability for us 16 executive officers and directors   the following tables set forth certain information regarding our executive officers and directors as of january 19 2003 executive officers    jeffrey p bezos mr bezos has been chairman of the board of amazoncom since founding it in 1994 and chief executive officer since may 1996 mr bezos served as president from founding until june 1999 and again from october 2000 to the present   richard l dalzell mr dalzell has served as senior vice president worldwide architecture and platform software and chief information officer since november 2001 from october 2000 until november 2001 mr dalzell was senior vice president and chief information officer and prior to that from joining amazoncom in august 1997 until october 2000 he was vice president and chief information officer   mark s peek mr peek has served as vice president and chief accounting officer since july 2002 from november 2000 to july 2002 he served as vice president financial planning and analysis and from april 2000 to november 2000 he served as vice president finance and chief accounting officer prior to joining amazoncom mr peek was an audit partner with deloitte  touche   diego piacentini mr piacentini has served as senior vice president worldwide retail and marketing since november 2001 from joining amazoncom in february 2000 until november 2001 mr piacentini was senior vice president and general manager international prior to joining amazoncom mr piacentini was vice president and general manager europe of apple computer inc with responsibility for apple computer’s operations in europe the middle east and africa   thomas j szkutak mr szkutak has served as senior vice president and chief financial officer since november 2002 previously mr szkutak held a variety of positions at general electric co including chief financial officer of ge lighting from september 2001 to september 2002 finance director of ge plastics europe from march 1999 to september 2001 and executive vice president — finance of ge asset management formerly known as ge investments from may 1997 to march 1999   jeffrey a wilke mr wilke has served as senior vice president worldwide operations and customer service since january 2002 from october 2000 until january 2002 mr wilke was senior vice president operations and prior to that he had been vice president and general manager operations since joining amazoncom in september 1999 previously mr wilke held a variety of positions at alliedsignal including vice president and general manager of the pharmaceutical fine chemicals unit 17 from march 1999 to september 1999 and general manager of the carbon materials and technologies unit from august 1997 to february 1999

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend forwardlooking statements   this annual report on form 10k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form 10k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain our actual results may differ significantly from management’s expectations the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements regarding expectations of future pro forma profitability net sales cash flows from operations and free cash flows all of which are inherently difficult to predict actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others the rate of growth of the economy in general the internet and online commerce customer spending patterns the amount that we invest in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services risks of inventory management the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop relationships with other businesses fluctuations in the value of securities and noncash payments we receive in connection with such transactions foreign exchange risks seasonality international growth and expansion and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations are described in greater detail in item 1 of part i 21 “business — additional factors that may affect future results” which along with the following discussion describes some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations 

results of operations critical accounting judgments   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 — description of business and accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions significant accounting policies 

 

   inventories consisting of products available for sale are valued at the lower of cost or market value which requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition whether through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category based on this evaluation which is applied consistently from period to period we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value 

 

   we generally recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured   we evaluate the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not the primary obligor and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned   product sales net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier commonly referred to as “fob shipping point” return allowances which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns are estimated using historical experience 22   we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include percentage discounts off current purchases “current discount offers” offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase “inducement offers” and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction and are presented as a net amount in “net sales” inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers   commissions received through our amazon marketplace and merchants programs and amounts earned through our merchantcom program are recorded as net amounts since we are acting as an agent amounts earned are recognized as net sales when the item is sold by the thirdparty seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured we record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience   we earn revenues from services primarily by entering into businesstobusiness commercial agreements including providing our technology services such as search browse and personalization permitting other businesses and individuals to offer products or services through our web sites and powering thirdparty web sites either with or without providing accompanying fulfillment services these commercial agreements also include miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements as compensation for the services we provide under these agreements we generally receive cash in the past we have accepted as compensation under these arrangements equity securities or a combination of equity securities and cash generally the fair value of the equity consideration received is measured when the agreement is executed but to the extent that the equity consideration is subject to forfeiture or vesting provisions and no significant performance commitment exists upon execution of the agreement the fair value of the equity consideration and corresponding revenue is determined as of the date that the forfeiture provision lapses or as the vesting provision lapses subsequent to initial measurement of fair value appreciation or decline in the fair value of such securities will affect our ultimate realization of equity securities received as compensation however any such change does not affect the amount of revenue to be recognized over the term of the agreement we generally recognize revenue from these marketing and promotional services including revenues associated with nonrefundable advance payments on a straightline basis over the period during which we perform services under these agreements commencing at the launch date of the service if we receive nonrefundable advance payments such amounts are deferred for revenue recognition purposes until service commences   included in services segment revenues are equitybased service revenues of 13 million 27 million and 79 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively   we have in the past and may in the future amend our agreements with certain of the companies with which we have commercial agreements to modify future cash proceeds to be received by us modify the service term of our commercial agreements or both although these amendments generally do not affect the amount of unearned revenue previously recorded by us if any the timing of future revenue recognition changes to correspond with the terms of amended agreements these amendments or future amendments will affect the timing and amount of revenues recognized in connection with these commercial agreements to the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable as future amounts are subsequently received such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement 

 

   for equity securities of public companies received as compensation under commercial agreements we generally determine fair value based on the quoted market price at the time we enter into the underlying commercial agreement and adjust such market price appropriately if significant restrictions on marketability exist because an observable market price does not exist for equity securities of private companies our estimates of fair value of such securities are more subjective than for the securities of 23 public companies for significant transactions involving equity securities in private companies we obtain and consider independent thirdparty valuations where appropriate such valuations use a variety of methodologies to estimate fair value including comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business applying price multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and utilizing estimated discounted cash flows for that company these valuations also reduce the otherwise fair value by a factor that is intended to account for restrictions on control and marketability where appropriate using these valuations and other information available to us such as our knowledge of the industry and the company itself we determine the estimated fair value of the securities received 

 

   effective july 1 2001 we adopted certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” and effective january 1 2002 we adopted the full provisions of sfas no 141 and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 141 requires business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets apart from goodwill we evaluated our goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to june 30 2001 using the criteria of sfas no 141 which resulted in 25 million of other intangibles comprised entirely of assembled workforce intangibles being subsumed into goodwill at january 1 2002 sfas no 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually we evaluated our intangible assets and determined that all such assets have determinable lives   sfas no 142 prescribes a twophase process for impairment testing of goodwill the first phase screens for impairment while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment we completed our first phase impairment analysis and found no instances of impairment of our recorded goodwill accordingly the second testing phase was not necessary during 2002 no subsequent indicators of impairment have been noted 

 

   restructuringrelated liabilities include estimates for among other things anticipated disposition of lease obligations key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated commencement timing of sublease rentals estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs and estimates for brokerage and other related costs we periodically evaluate and if necessary adjust our estimates based on currentlyavailable information results of operations

  net sales for our bmvd segment were 187 billion 169 billion and 170 billion for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing an increase of 11 for 2002 in comparison with a decline of 1 for 2001

marketplace sales of these products new used or collectible amounts earned from sales of these products by other businesses through our merchants program and product revenues from stores offering these products through our syndicated stores program the improvement in growth rates for our bmvd segment in 2002 in comparison with 2001 reflects increased unit sales resulting from our continuing efforts to reduce prices for customers including increases in customer discounts on books and the introduction of everyday free shipping at wwwamazoncom for certain orders also contributing to the 2002 increase in growth rates for bmvd are increases in unit sales through amazon marketplace   net sales for our etk segment were 645 million 547 million and 484 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing increases of 18 and 13 for 2002 and 2001 respectively this segment includes wwwamazoncom retail sales of electronics home improvement and home and garden products as well as

other businesses through our merchants program such as with office depot and will include revenues from stores offering these products if any through our syndicated stores program the improvement in growth rates for our etk segment in 2002 in comparison with 2001 reflects increased unit sales resulting from our continuing efforts to reduce prices for customers including increases in customer discounts through price changes and rebate programs and the introduction of everyday free shipping at wwwamazoncom for certain orders also contributing to the 2002 increase in growth rates for etk are increases in unit sales through amazon marketplace   net sales for our international segment were 117 billion 661 million and 381 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing increases of 77 and 74 for 2002 and 2001 respectively we anticipate that as the revenue base of our international segment increases the percentage growth rates will likely decline over time during 2002 revenues improved 47 million in comparison to 2001 due to changes in foreign exchange rates specifically the weakening of the us dollar in comparison to the euro and the british pound this segment includes all retail sales of the following internationallyfocused web sites wwwamazoncouk wwwamazonde wwwamazonfr and wwwamazoncojp  these international sites share a common amazoncom experience but are localized in terms of language products customer service and fulfillment to the extent available on these sites this segment includes commissions and other amounts earned from sales of products through amazon marketplace and revenues from stores offering products through our syndicated stores program such as wwwwaterstonescouk and wwwvirginmegacojp  and amounts earned from sales of products by other businesses through our merchants program our international segment includes export sales from wwwamazoncouk wwwamazonde wwwamazonfr and wwwamazoncojp including export sales from these sites to customers in the us and canada but excludes export sales from wwwamazoncom and wwwamazonca  the increase in net sales from our international segment results from in each of the four internationallyfocused web sites an increase in unit sales in part due to the introduction of amazon marketplace on wwwamazoncouk wwwamazonde and wwwamazoncojp  and our continuing efforts to reduce prices to customers through increases in customer discounts and free and reducedrate shipping offers the future growth of our international segment may fluctuate significantly with changes in foreign exchange rates see item 1 of part i “business — additional factors that may affect future results — we have foreign exchange risk”   net sales for our services segment were 246 million 225 million and 198 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing increases of 9 and 13 respectively this segment consists of 25 commissions fees and other amounts earned from our services business

store the toysruscom and babiesruscom stores and portions of the target store at wwwamazoncom  as well as our commercial agreement with america online inc this segment also includes auctions zshops amazon payments and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements the increase in net sales from our services segment results from amounts earned through our merchants program and our merchantcom program offset by the expiration of certain of our marketing and promotional agreements the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these services agreements is dependent on the volume of sales that the other company makes see item 1 of part i “business — additional factors that may affect future results — our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships” 

  shipping revenue which consists of outbound shipping charges to our customers across all operating segments was 365 million 357 million and 339 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively shipping revenue does not include any commissions or other amounts earned from amazon marketplace in january 2002 we introduced a new shipping option at wwwamazoncom  offering everyday free shipping for certain orders that exceed a specified amount and we lowered this threshold several times throughout the year we offer similar shipping options for our internationallyfocused web sites and may offer other free or reducedfee shipping options over time these shipping offers reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and cause our gross margins on retail sales to decline we view these shipping offers as an effective marketing tool   first quarter of 2003 net sales are expected to be between 1025 billion and 1075 billion or grow between 21 and 27 for the full year 2003 net sales are expected to grow over 15 however any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty see item 1 of part 1 “business — additional factors that may affect future results” 

 

   gross profit is net sales less the cost of sales which consists of the purchase price of consumer products sold by us inbound and outbound shipping charges to us packaging supplies and certain costs associated with our service revenues costs associated with our services segment revenues and classified as cost of services generally include fulfillmentrelated costs to ship products on behalf of thirdparty sellers costs to provide customer service credit card fees and other related costs   effective january 1 2002 we prospectively changed our inventory costing method to the firstin firstout “fifo” method of accounting this change resulted in a cumulative increase in product inventory of 08 million with a corresponding amount recorded to “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” on the statements of operations in 2002 we evaluated the effect of the change on each quarter during 2001 and determined such effect to be less than 12 million individually and in the aggregate we determined this change to be preferable under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states since among other reasons it facilitates our record keeping process significantly improves our ability to provide costefficient fulfillment services to other companies as part of our services offering and results in increased consistency with others in our industry   gross profit was 993 million 799 million and 656 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing increases of 24 and 22 for 2002 and 2001 respectively gross margin was 25 26 and 24 for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively increases in gross profit in 2002 primarily correspond with increases in units sold including increased product sales through amazon marketplace improvements in transportation and inventory management and improvements in product sourcing offset by price reductions on books and electronics the expiration of certain highmargin marketing and promotional agreements and our free and reducedrate shipping offers increases in gross profit in 2001 primarily correspond with improvements in inventory management and product sourcing and to a lesser extent increased product sales through amazon marketplace our overall gross margins fluctuate based on several factors including 26 our mix of sales during the period including sales through amazon marketplace competitive pricing decisions and general efforts to reduce prices for our customers over time as well as the extent to which we provide free and reducedrate shipping offers 

  gross profit for our bmvd segment was 528 million 453 million and 417 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing increases of 16 and 9 for 2002 and 2001 respectively gross margin was 28 27 and 25 for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the slight improvement in gross margin corresponds with the increase in higher margin sales through amazon marketplace improvements in transportation costs and inventory management and continued improvements in product sourcing offset by price reductions and our everyday free shipping offer   gross profit for our etk segment was 90 million 78 million and 45 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing increases of 15 and 76 for 2002 and 2001 respectively gross margin was 14 for 2002 and 2001 and 9 for 2000 in 2002 improvements in product sourcing inventory management and transportation management along with lower transportation costs were offset by price reductions and our everyday free shipping offer in 2001 improvement in gross margin primarily reflects improvements in product sourcing and inventory management   during 2002 sales of products through amazon marketplace increased significantly in comparison to the prior year if product sales through amazon marketplace continue to increase we anticipate improvement in gross margin offset to the extent we offer additional or broader price reductions free shipping offers and other promotions   gross profit for our international segment was 249 million 141 million and 77 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing increases of 77 and 82 for 2002 and 2001 respectively gross margin was 21 for 2002 and 2001 and 20 for 2000 the increase in gross profit in 2002 reflects increases in units sold by each of our four internationallyfocused web sites included in this segment in part due to the introduction of amazon marketplace on wwwamazoncouk wwwamazonde and wwwamazoncojp  offset by continuing efforts to reduce prices for our customers during 2002 gross profit improved 10 million in comparison to 2001 due to changes in foreign exchange rates specifically the weakening of the us dollar in comparison to the euro and the british poundthe increase in gross profit in 2001 reflects increases in units sold by our wwwamazonde and wwwamazoncouk sites as well as the launch of our wwwamazonfr and wwwamazoncojp sites during the second half of 2000   gross profit for our services segment was 126 million for 2002 and 2001 and 116 million for 2000 representing flat gross profit in 2002 and an increase of 9 for 2001 costs associated with our service revenues generally include fulfillmentrelated costs to ship products on behalf of other businesses including costs to provide customer service credit card fees and other related costs gross margin was 51 56 and 59 for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively gross profit from our services segment largely corresponds with revenues from our commercial agreements which includes our merchantcom program and to the extent product categories are not also offered by us through our online retail stores the merchants program as well as amounts earned through miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements the decline in gross margin from our services segment relates to service costs classified in cost of sales resulting from the shift in the mix of our commercial relationships towards agreements that incorporate a broader range of services including fulfillment also contributing to the decline in services gross margin in 2002 was the expiration of certain highmargin marketing and promotional agreements we expect services segment margins will decline again in 2003 since highmargin marketing arrangements are expected to represent a lower percentage of our overall revenue mix for this segment see item 1 of part 1 “business — additional factors that may affect future results — our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships”   shipping loss across all operating segments was 40 million 19 million and 1 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the loss from shipping primarily reflects the free and reducedrate shipping offers offset in part by cost reductions from efficiencies in our outbound shipping we continue to measure our shipping results relative to their effect on our overall financial results with the viewpoint that shipping 27 promotions are an effective marketing tool in january 2002 we introduced a new shipping option at wwwamazoncom  offering everyday free shipping for certain orders that exceed specified purchase thresholds we offer a similar shipping option for our internationallyfocused web sites and may offer other free or reducedfee shipping options over time we expect to continue offering our customers free shipping options which reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and negatively affect gross margins 

 

   fulfillment costs represent those costs incurred in operating and staffing our fulfillment and customer service centers including costs attributable to receiving inspecting and warehousing inventories picking packaging and preparing customer orders for shipment credit card fees and bad debt costs and responding to inquiries from customers fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to thirdparty cosourcers that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations certain services segment fulfillmentrelated costs incurred on behalf of other businesses are classified as cost of sales rather than fulfillment fulfillment costs were 392 million 374 million and 415 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing 10 12 and 15 of net sales respectively the improvement in fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales results from improvements in productivity and accuracy the increase in units fulfilled helping to leverage the fixedcost portion of our fulfillment network a decline in customer service contacts per order resulting from improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features available on our web sites these improvements were offset in part by increases in employee wages and benefits and credit card interchange fees associated with amazon marketplace which represent a higher percent of commissions earned relative to amounts earned from retail sales of our inventory additionally the comparisons between 2001 and 2000 and to a lesser extent the comparisons between 2002 and 2001 were affected by the closures in 2001 of our fulfillment centers in mcdonough georgia and seattle washington and customer service centers in the hague netherlands and seattle washington 

 

   marketing expenses consist of advertising promotional and public relations expenditures and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities marketing expenses net of cooperative marketing reimbursements were 125 million 138 million and 180 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing 3 4 and 7 of net sales respectively to the extent cooperative marketing reimbursements decline in future periods we may incur additional expenses to continue certain promotions or elect to reduce or discontinue them declines in expense for marketingrelated activities reflect management efforts to cut ineffective marketing programs as well as reduced rates charged to us for some online marketing activities these decreases are partially offset by increased investment in marketing channels considered most effective in driving incremental net sales such as targeted online advertising through various web portals and our associates program in january 2002 we introduced a new shipping option at wwwamazoncom  offering everyday free shipping for certain orders that exceed a specified amount we offer similar shipping options for our internationallyfocused web sites although marketing expenses do not include our free and reduced shipping offers we view such offers as an effective marketing tool 

 

   technology and content expenses consist principally of payroll and related expenses for development editorial systems and telecommunications operations personnel systems and telecommunications infrastructure and costs of acquired content including freelance reviews technology and content expenses were 216 million 241 million and 269 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing 5 8 and 10 of net sales respectively the decline in absolute dollars spent for each comparative period primarily reflects our migration to a technology platform that utilizes a lesscostly technology infrastructure as well as improved expense management and general price reductions in most expense categories we expect to continue to invest in technology and improvements to our web sites which may 28 include but are not limited to hiring additional employees offering additional web site features and product categories to our customers and implementing additional commercial relationships as well as potentially continuing our international expansion 

 

   general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive finance and administrative personnel human resources professional fees and other general corporate expenses general and administrative expenses were 79 million 90 million and 109 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively representing 2 3 and 4 of net sales respectively the decline in 2002 in general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to a decline in facility and depreciation costs resulting from our 2001 operational restructuring plan that consolidated our corporate office locations and through continued efforts to improve efficiency the decline in 2001 in general and administrative costs is attributable to reductions in most administrative expense categories including employeerelated facility and depreciation costs supplies and other miscellaneous charges as well as decreased costs as a result of our 2001 operational restructuring 

 

   stockbased compensation was 69 million 5 million and 25 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively stockbased compensation includes stockbased charges resulting from variable accounting treatment of certain stock options and restricted stock issued to certain key employees as well as amounts associated with our newlyimplemented restricted stock unit program stockbased compensation also includes to a lesser extent a portion of acquisitionrelated consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of certain key employees of acquired businesses under our restricted stock unit program which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002 we award restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation restricted stock units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period to the extent restricted stock units are forfeited prior to vesting the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to “stockbased compensation” stockbased compensation associated with our restricted stock unit program was 4 million in 2002   the number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding vested and unvested employee stock awards including restricted stock units was approximately 45 million and 66 million or 12 and 18 of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively   during the first quarter of 2001 we offered a limited noncompulsory exchange of employee stock options which resulted in variable accounting treatment for approximately 5 million stock options at december 31 2002 including approximately 4 million options granted under the exchange offer that have exercise prices of 13375 and expire in the third quarter of 2003 variable accounting treatment results in unpredictable and potentially significant charges or credits recorded to “stockbased compensation” dependent on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock we have quantified the hypothetical effect on “stockbased compensation” associated with various quoted prices of our common stock which we are unable to forecast accurately using a sensitivity analysis for our outstanding stock options subject to variable accounting at december 31 2002 we have provided this information to give additional insight into the volatility we will experience in our future results of operations to the extent that the quoted price for our common stock is above 13375 this sensitivity analysis is not a prediction of future performance of the quoted prices of our common stock   using the following hypothetical market prices of our common stock above 13375 including the actual expense associated with options exercised our hypothetical cumulative compensation expense at 29 december 31 2002 resulting from variable accounting treatment would have been as follows in thousands except percentages and per share amounts 

   actual variableaccounting related compensation could differ significantly from the above illustration in instances where options are exercised during a period at prices that differ from the closing stock price for the reporting period as of december 31 2002 the company’s common stock closed at 1889 representing an increase of 41 over 13375 cumulative compensation expense associated with variable accounting treatment was 60 million of which 40 million is associated with options exercised and therefore no longer subject to future variability   if at the end of any fiscal quarter the quoted price of our common stock is lower than the quoted price at the end of the previous fiscal quarter or to the extent previouslyrecorded amounts relate to unvested portions of options that were cancelled compensation expense associated with variable accounting will be recalculated using the cumulative expense method and may result in a net benefit to our results of operations 

 

   amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was 5 million 181 million and 322 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decline in amortization of goodwill and intangibles in 2002 primarily results from our adoption of sfas no 141 which resulted in 25 million of intangible assets comprised of assembled workforce intangibles being subsumed into goodwill and our adoption of sfas no 142 which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized the decline in amortization of goodwill and intangibles in 2001 results from an impairment loss of 184 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 associated with certain of our 1999 business acquisitions this impairment loss reduced our recorded basis in goodwill and other intangibles and had the effect of reducing amortization expense during 2001 

 

   restructuringrelated and other expenses were 42 million 182 million and 200 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively in the first quarter of 2001 we announced and began implementation of our operational restructuring plan to reduce operating costs streamline our organizational structure consolidate certain of our fulfillment and customer service operations and migrate a large portion of our technology infrastructure to a new operating platform this initiative involved the reduction of employee staff by 1327 positions throughout the company in managerial professional clerical technical and fulfillment roles consolidation of our seattle washington corporate office locations closure of our mcdonough georgia fulfillment center seasonal operation of our seattle washington fulfillment center closure of our customer service centers in seattle washington and the hague netherlands and migration of a large portion of our technology infrastructure to a new operating platform which entails ongoing lease obligations for technology infrastructure no longer being utilized actual employee termination benefits paid were 12 million the restructuring is complete however we may adjust our restructuringrelated estimates in the future if necessary   during 2002 we revised our estimates of ongoing net lease obligations for our facilities in seattle washington and mcdonough georgia primarily due to weakness in these real estate markets we reached a termination agreement with the landlord of our leased fulfillment center facility in mcdonough georgia 30 which requires payments totaling 12 million of which 4 million was paid in december 2002 with the balance payable in the first quarter of 2003 and we permanently closed our fulfillment center in seattle washington

   our results from operations were income of 64 million and losses of 412 million and 864 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the improvement in operating results in comparison with the prior year was attributable to an increase in gross profit a reduction in certain operating costs including marketing technology and content and general and administrative a decline in restructuringrelated charges as well as a decline in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 142 offset by stockbased compensation charges associated primarily with certain of our employee stock options under variable accounting treatment we are unable to forecast accurately the effect on our future reported results associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options 

 

   net interest expense was 119 million 110 million and 90 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively interest income was 24 million 29 million and 41 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively and interest expense was 143 million 139 million and 131 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively interest income declined in 2002 in comparison with 2001 primarily as a result of declining interest rates offset in part by increases in the average balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income declined in 2001 in comparison with 2000 due primarily to decreases in the average balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest expense is primarily related to our 6875 peacs 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2009 “475 convertible subordinated notes” and our senior discount notes the increase in interest expense for 2001 in comparison with 2000 is primarily associated with our february 2000 issuance of the 6875 peacs at december 31 2002 our total longterm indebtedness was 228 billion beginning in november 2003 we will begin to make semiannual interest payments on the indebtedness under our senior discount notes 

 

   other income expense net consisted of the following in thousands  32 

 

   other gains losses net consisted of the following in thousands  

 

   equity in losses of equitymethod investees represents our share of losses of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee this influence is generally defined as an ownership interest of the voting stock of the investee of between 20 and 50 although other factors such as representation on our investee’s board of directors and the effect of commercial arrangements are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate equitymethod losses were 4 million 30 million and 305 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively our basis in equitymethod investments was less than 1 million and 10 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively as equitymethod losses are only recorded until the underlying investments are reduced to zero we expect absent additional investments equitymethod losses in future periods to be insignificant 

 

   we have provided for current and deferred us federal state and foreign income taxes for the current and all prior periods presented current and deferred income taxes were provided with respect to jurisdictions where certain of our subsidiaries produce taxable income as of december 31 2002 we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of 3 million which consists primarily of certain state jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards we have provided a valuation allowance for the remainder of our deferred tax asset consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards because of uncertainty regarding its realization the increase in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset was 196 million and 492 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively   at december 31 2002 we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 25 billion related to us federal state and foreign jurisdictions utilization of net operating losses which begin to expire at various times starting in 2010 may be subject to certain limitations under sections 382 and 1502 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and other limitations under state and foreign tax laws additionally approximately 180 million of capital loss carryforwards begins to expire in 2005 approximately 12 billion of our net operating loss carryforwards relates to tax deductible stockbased compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes to the extent that net operating loss carryforwards if realized relate to stockbased compensation the resulting tax benefits will be recorded to stockholders’ equity rather than to results of operations 

 

   net loss was 149 million 567 million and 141 billion for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively year over year improvements during 2002 and 2001 result from a variety of factors including growth in net 33 sales overall declines in operating costs offset by stockbased compensation charges associated primarily with certain of our employee stock options under variable accounting treatment lower impairment charges associated with our investment portfolio and declines in losses from equitymethod investments offset by losses arising from the remeasurement of our 6875 peacs’s principal from euros to us dollars 

  although we reported fourth quarter of 2002 net income of 3 million we believe that this positive net income result should not be viewed as a material positive event and is not predictive of future results for a variety of reasons for example excluding the 5 million restructuringrelated gain associated with our mcdonough georgia fulfillment center leasetermination agreement we would have reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2002 alternatively excluding the 31 million stockbased compensation charge associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options that resulted from an increase in our stock price during the fourth quarter or excluding the 38 million foreign exchange loss on the remeasurement of our peacs from euros to us dollars we would have reported more net income in the fourth quarter of 2002 we are unable to forecast the effect on our future reported results of certain items including the stockbased compensation charges or credits associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options that will result from fluctuations in our stock price and the gain or loss associated with our 6875 peacs that will result from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
